AIM  The objective of the present study was to estimate the effectiveness of the new therapeutic modalities for the spa and health resort-based treatment of metabolic syndrome based on the results of the long-term follow-up observations.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 100 patients presenting with metabolic syndrome were recruited for the participation in the study.  All of them underwent a shortened course of mineral water intake in the combination with the use of the herbal medicinal products.
RESULTS
The results of the study give evidence of the more favorable changes in the clinical and instrumental characteristics of the patients with metabolic syndrome treated with the use of the proposed approach in comparison the patients treated by the conventional methods.  Moreover, the beneficial effects of the proposed approach persisted during a longer period.
The basal treatment given to our patients was supplemented by dietary therapy, therapeutic physical exercise, narzan baths, intake of mineral water having a temperature of 35-37 °С in conjunction with sulphate mineral water (narzan) cooled to 13-15 °С, and a phytococktail.
CONCLUSION  The results of the long-term observations confirmed the enhanced effectiveness of the spa and health resort-based treatment of metabolic syndrome including the therapeutic courses with the intake of cooled narzan mineral water in the combination with phytococktails.
This therapeutic modality increased the duration of the favorable changes of various parameters that characterize metabolic syndrome.  Specifically, they persisted during 5-6 months after the application of the standard methods, were still apparent within 6-7 months after the two-week course of the treatment with cold narzan and phytococktails, and during 8-9 months when the duration of the treatment course was extended up to 3 weeks.
