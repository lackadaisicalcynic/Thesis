[The currently available possibilities for the application of photogrammetry in the forensic medical expertise of the blood stains at the scene of the crime].
The study of blood stains retained at the scene of the crime is of crucial importance for the preliminary inquiry.  The present article is focused on the analysis of the possibilities and prospects for the use of photogrammetry (PM) as exemplified by the foreign expert practice of the blood stains examination at the site of the event.
It is shown that the results of the application of digital photogrammetry in addition to the traditional methods of morphological investigations enables the forensic medical experts to reconstruct a number of unique features and circumstances that accompanied the commission of a crime at the site of the event.
Such PM techniques supplemented by the ballistic analysis of the blood splatter and droplet trajectories provides additional evidence that allows the forensic medical experts to reconstruct the scene of the crime including the pose and position of the victim at the moment of causing injury.  Moreover, these data make it possible to determine the maximum number and the sequence of injurious impacts (blows).
The authors discuss the advantages and relative disadvantages of the application of the photogrammetric technique in the routine practical expert work.
It is emphasized that the published decision making algorithms provide the specialists in various disciplines and professional experts with the ready-made technological tools for obtaining the additional criteria for the objective improvement of the quality of the studies they carry out and for the enhancement of the value of expert conclusions.
It is concluded that the application of the modern photogrammetric technologies can be recommended for the solution of the applied forensic medical problems and conducting the relevant expert research.
