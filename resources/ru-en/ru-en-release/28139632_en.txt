[A study of the association between the kynurenine-3-monooxygenase gene and depression].
AIM  To study the association between the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) and depression.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
КМО rs2275163 (C/T) and rs1053230 (A /G) polymorphisms were genotyped in patients diagnosed with depression (the main group) and age - and sex-matched healthy people.
RESULTS
The rs2275163 polymorphism was not associated with depression.
There was the association between the rs1053230 polymorphism and depression.
The frequency of the low expression genotype GG was higher in the main group compared to controls
(р=0.001, ОШ 2.8 (95% ДИ 1.73-4.24).
This genotype was earlier reported to be associated with the increased levels of kynurenic acid in patients with bipolar disorders.  CONCLUSION  The genotype GG can be considered as a risk factor of depression.
