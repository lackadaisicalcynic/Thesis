[Results of comprehensive management of patients with chronic lower limb ischaemia using gene-engineering technologies of angiogenesis stimulation (Part 1)].
Presented herein are the results of clinical use of gene engineering methods of stimulating angiogenesis in patients with chronic lower limb ischaemia.  An open prospective controlled clinical study included a total of 160 patients with chronic lower limb ischaemia.
Gene engineering technologies of angiogenesis stimulation were used both as an independent method of treatment in comprehensive conservative therapy (80 patients) and as comprehensive treatment in combination with revascularizing operations (80 patients).  Part One of the article deals with the results outcomes of using the above technologies in combination combined with surgical treatment.
It was shown that gene-engineering technologies of angiogenesis stimulation increase efficiency of comprehensive management of patients with lower limb chronic ischaemia of any severity.
Additional use of gene-engineering methods of inducing angiogenesis does not virtually change the immediate outcomes of surgical treatment but considerably increase their efficacy in the remote postoperative period and accordingly improves the long-term results of treatment for this cohort of patients.
