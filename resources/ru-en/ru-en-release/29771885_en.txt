PURPOSE  comparative assessment of safety and clinical efficacy of Sevoflurane and Halothane in general anesthesia for nasolacrimal duct intubation in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Clinical results of nasolacrimal duct intubation in 288 children with persistent obstruction of tear duct were analyzed.
A newly developed method of general anesthesia in the supine position was used for all cases.
General anesthetic Phthorothanum was used in 146 children; general anesthesia with Sevoflurane - in 142 children.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A new safe and efficient method of general anesthesia for nasolacrimal duct intubation was developed.
In the first group, aspiration complications (coughing) occurred in 7 patients under the age of 1 year and short apnea - in 2 children.
In the second group, depression of respiration was seen in a three-year-old child caused by the action of the anesthetic, and coughing - in one patient under the age of 1 year during the final phase of intubation.
CONCLUSIONS
The newly developed method of general anesthesia in the supine position with oropharyngeal aspiration for nasolacrimal duct intubation in children was effective because it helped avoid aspiration complications at a more physiological position (on the back) in children of both groups.
Comparative analysis of safety and efficacy of mask anesthesia with Sevoflurane and Halothane for nasolacrimal duct intubation in children in the supine position showed Sevoflurane to be more preferable.
The advantages of Sevoflurane anesthesia for nasolacrimal duct intubation in children in the supine position are higher anesthesia induction speed, absence of respiratory tract irritation, cardiodepressive effects or suppression of laryngeal reflexes, and minimum time between the end of anesthesia and awakening.
