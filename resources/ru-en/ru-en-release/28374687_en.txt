To study the frequency of non-psychotic mental disorders in patients with epilepsy, to specify the clinical features of non-psychotic affective disorders and to analyze the association of different variants of affective disorders with symptoms of drug-resistance in epilepsy (DRE).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and sixty patients with epilepsy, including 80 patients with DRE and 80 patients with controlled epilepsy (CE), were studied using a battery of psychometric scales.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The variety of depressive and anxious psychiatric condition was detected in 59.4% of PE, in 86.3% of patients with DRE and in 32.5% with CE.  A clinical and psychopathological analysis of non-psychotic mental disorders showed that the frequency of affective disorders as well as great «structural complexity» and the depth of depressive and anxiety disorders were significantly higher in the group of patients with DRE compared to patients with CE.
