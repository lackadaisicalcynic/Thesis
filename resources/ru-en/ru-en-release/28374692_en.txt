[The features of botulinum therapy for different patterns of poststroke spasticity].  AIM
To assess the efficacy of botulinum toxin therapy for different patterns of poststroke spasticity.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-nine patients with poststroke spasticity were examined.  Rehabilitation included 4 treatment courses of inpatient rehabilitation during 9 month usinga multidisciplinary team approach.
Botulinum toxin therapy was included in the program.  The individual program was developed taking into account the dynamics of a pathological spastic pattern.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The transformation of the pathological movement pattern was observed during the rehabilitation using botulinum toxin.
The best positive changes, including an improvement of the upper extremity function, walk and a decrease in the degree of paresis, was identified when botulinum toxin therapy was used in early stages of neurorehabilitation (1-3 month after stroke).
