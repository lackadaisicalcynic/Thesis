[Stroke in children and adolescents: a formation of a pediatric register].
AIM  To optimize a system of medical care, introduction of treatment and diagnostic guidelines, including secondary stroke prevention and rehabilitation measures, by implementation of pediatric stroke registry.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-seven patients, aged from 1 year to 17 years 11 months, included into the Moscow city registry of pediatric stroke were examined.  Forty-two patients suffered ischemic stroke and 15 hemorrhagic stroke.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The diagnostic search for the causes of pediatric stroke is difficult due to the wide variety of etiologic factors and high frequency of their combinations.
This confirms the necessity of multidisciplinary approach to the management of children and adolescents in the acute phase of stroke in a multiprofile hospital with the following specialized ambulatory care.
