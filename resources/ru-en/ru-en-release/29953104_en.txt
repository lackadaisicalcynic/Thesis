[Fatal renal and neurological complications after aortic arch repair in newborns].
To evaluate effectiveness and safety of various methods of cerebral and visceral protection during aortic arch surgery in infants.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Retrospective analysis included 60 patients after aortic arch repair followed by different cerebral protection technique who have been assessed for neurological status and visceral injury in early and long-term postoperative period.  Aortic arch surgery with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest for congenital diseases was performed in 26 patients (group 1) and antegrade unilateral selective cerebral perfusion in 34 patients (group 2).
RESULTS
Cerebral complications occurred in 28.5% of patients of the 1st group and in 7.9% of patients of the 2nd group.
CONCLUSION
Odds ratio for neurological event is significantly lower in group 2: 0.17 (0.06-0.69; p=0.02).
However, there were more patients with renal dysfunction in this group compared with group 1: 58.7% vs. 23.7% (p=0.02).
