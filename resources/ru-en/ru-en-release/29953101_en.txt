[Fast track rehabilitation in perforated duodenal ulcer].
AIM
To analyze the outcomes of fast track rehabilitation program in patients with perforated duodenal ulcer (PDU).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period 2013-2016 at the Department of Surgery and Endoscopy 206 PDU patients have been treated.
Inclusion criterion for the main group (n=77) was duodenal ulcers, their dimension up to 1 cm, laparoscopic suture of perforated ulcer, fast track rehabilitation program implementation.
The control group consisted of 129 patients who underwent open suturing of perforated ulcer followed by conventional treatment in postoperative period.
RESULTS
In the main group (n=77) laparoscopic suturing of ulcerative defect with the use of Fast Track program was performed.
Postoperative complication i.e. sutures failure was observed in 1 (1.3%) case.
There were no lethal outcomes in the main group.
Mean length of hospital-stay was 4.8 days.
In 129 patients of the control group open suturing of the perforated ulcer and conventional postoperative therapy were applied.
Postoperative surgical complications were absent in the control group; mortality rate was 2.3%.
Mean length of postoperative hospital-stay was 8.1 days.
CONCLUSION
Laparoscopic treatment of perforated ulcers facilitates application of fast track rehabilitation program in emergency patients.
Fast track rehabilitation protocol after laparoscopic suturing of the perforated ulcer creates conditions for early discharge and is followed by good clinical and economic effects.
Recurrent peptic ulcers are noted if antiulcer therapy is absent.
