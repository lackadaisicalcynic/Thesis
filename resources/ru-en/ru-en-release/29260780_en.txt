[The results of bilateral cochlear implantation in the children who survived meningitis].  The objective of the present study was the prospective analysis of the results of bilateral cochlear implantation (CI) in the children presenting with bilateral ossification of the cochlea after they had survived meningitis.
A total of 15 patients underwent the surgical intervention.  In those exhibiting bilateral ossification of the basal cochlear helix over the 5 mm segment (up to first bend of the cochlear turn) and partial ossification of the second helix (in 6 children), the affected portions were removed with the placement of two choleostomies, the lower one (from the ossified membrane of the cochlear window) and the upper one (toward the second helix).
Activation of the speech processors of the CI systems was carried out within 4-6 weeks after surgery.
The hearing abilities of the children were evaluated in accordance with the 'Estimation of the auditory perception categories', 'Estimation of the child's apprehension capacity', and 'Analysis of speech intelligibility rating' guidelines.
In all the children with ossification over less than 5 mm of the basal cochlear helix, it proved possible to introduce the whole intracochlear electrode grid whereas only half of the electrode array was implanted in the cases of overall ossification of the basal helix.
The first results obtained by telemetry and surdopedagogical testing gave evidence of the possibility of identifying various sources of non-verbal and speech stimuli in all the treated children at a small (up to 3 meters) distance.
