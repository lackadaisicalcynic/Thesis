[Choice of local anesthetic volume at the infiltration anesthesia on the upper jaw].  The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of volume and pressure, at which the solution of local anesthetic is injected into the tissue, on the effectiveness of infiltration anesthesia of the periosteum on the upper jaw.
We used the technique of tooth pain sensitivity thresholds.  According to the rate of development and the duration of the maximum analgesia effect, the optimum volume for different levels of pressure was determined.
The influence of the tissue density at the injection site on the effect criteria of analgesia was demonstrated.
