[Depression in alcohol addicted patients].
In this review, authors considered characteristics of depression and alcohol addiction.
Depressive disorders comorbid to alcoholism are heterogeneous in their nature and structure and can be observed during alcohol withdrawal syndrome and in remission.  Antidepressants, and first of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), along with the specific anti-relapse drugs (disulfiram, acamprosate and naltrexone), are the drugs of choice in treatment of alcohol addiction.
Efficient combinations of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy can improve outcomes of both comorbid disorders.
