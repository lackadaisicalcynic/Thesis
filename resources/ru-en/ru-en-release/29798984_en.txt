[Assessment of the efficacy of mexidol in the combination with hyperbaric oxygen in acute ischemic stroke].  To study the efficacy of mexidol in the combination with hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) in comparison with the standard HBO sessions in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
One hundred and twelve patients were examined.
In the main group, 48 patients underwent HBO and received treatment with mexidol.  The control group consisted of 64 people who underwent the standard HBO sessions only.
The use of combination therapy (HBO+mexidol) leads to the significantly more rapid normalization of acute phase indices which are correlated with neurological deficit reduction.
