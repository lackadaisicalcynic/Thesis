[Assessment of microvascular bulbar conjunctiva in patients with type 1 diabetes].
UNLABELLED
The aim was to study the state of microvascular bulbar conjunctiva in patients with type 1 diabetes.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A clinical study of 25 patients with DR in the type 1 diabetes and 20 healthy persons without ophthalmopathology.  All patients in addition to conventional methods of ophthalmological conducted computer Capillaroscopy bulbar conjunctiva.
RESULTS
Results of the study showed patients with DR in the type 1 diabetes tortuosity of capillaries (due to thickening of the basement membrane), the expansion of the department of venous capillaries and arterial narrowing department, the formation of aggregates, the phenomenon of sludge and slowing blood flow.
After a course of treatment (Tanakan 2 months to 120 mg. per day) capillaroscopy showed a positive trend state bulbar conjunctiva microvessels: reduction in the incidence of the phenomenon of sludge and the duration of stasis, increased blood flow, which correlated with the positive dynamics ophthalmoscopic picture.
CONCLUSION
The results indicate the informativeness capillaroscopy as a method of assessing the state of the microvasculature in patients with type 1 diabetes.
