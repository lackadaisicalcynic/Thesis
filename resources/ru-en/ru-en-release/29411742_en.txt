[Indicators of homeostasis, inflammation and homocysteine in ischemic stroke in the young age].
AIM  To determine indicators of homeostasis, inflammation and homocysteine in the young-aged patients with ischemic stroke (IS) of different genesis in the subacute and chronic stages.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Out of 218 patients with IS (mean age 34.7Â±8.7 years), 55 had stroke due to dissection of the inner carotid or the spinal artery, 28 due to cardioembolia, 38 due to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), 16 due to cerebral arteritis; 85 patients were classified as having cryptogenic stroke, including 23 with noncerebral thrombosis (coagulopathy of unknown etiology) and 62 with no thrombosis.
The control group included 28 healthy people matched for age and sex.
RESULTS
There were 1) an increase in von Willebrand factor and coagulation factor VIII as well as a decrease in plasminogen and an increase in plasmin-inhibitor in IS caused by thrombosis (APS, cardioembolia, coagulopathy of unknown etiology); 2) alterations in erythrocyte aggregation and deformity in cryptogenic stroke; 3) mild or moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, with the exception of patients with APS and arteritis.
Linear regression analysis confirmed these relationships.
Discriminant analysis identified the clusters of parameters characteristic of APS (an increase in (aPTT), plasminogen, blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) and cardioembolia (decreased protein C and increased hematocrit).
CONCLUSION
The laboratory markers associated with cerebral thrombosis can be used for identification of a prothrombotic state as a cause of IS in the young age.
Moderate hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor but not a cause of IS.
The increase of inflammatory markers in APS suggests a role of infection in its development.
