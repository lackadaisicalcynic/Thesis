[Should a doctor take into consideration the influence of climatic factors?  Deliberations on the occasion of the publication of a new monograph (the book of essays of arid medicine by Z.R. Zununov, I.H. Nurov, and S.Z. Zununova)].
The authors analyze the monograph of the Uzbek scientists professor Z.R. Zununov, I.H. Nurov, and S.Z. Zununova «Essays of arid medicine» (Tashkent: «KAMALAK-PRESS» publishing house, 2016;540).  The book presents the results of the comprehensive bioclimatic assessment of the arid zones of Uzbekistan, their extreme climatic conditions
(such as high intensity and solar radiation and the considerable duration of its period, dry air and summer heat, sandstorms (the so-called «Afghans»), and the great variety of the natural health-improving factors including mineral waters, microclimate of the speleotherapeutic cave, the desert dune sand, etc.  The work is based on the authors' conceptual theory of «arid/meteorological stress syndrome», underlain by the hypothesis of the predominant role of hyperthermal weather hypoxia.
A wide range of issues id discussed related to weather and climate adaptation of the healthy subjects (both indigenous and non-indigenous residents) and the patients suffering from ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.  Of special interest are the methods proposed for the correction of dysadaptive changes including the application of the natural balneotherapeutic factors existing in the arid zone
(hydrogen sulphide and iodine-bromine balneotherapy, climatic therapy, speleotherapy, and psammotherapy (arenation).  An important definitive conclusion at which the authors arrive is the necessity of the experimental observations in agreement with the requirements of the medico-biological ethics.
