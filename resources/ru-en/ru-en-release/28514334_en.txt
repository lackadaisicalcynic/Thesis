[Anxiety and depressive disorders in Parkinson's disease].
This review presents the most recent data of worldwide research on anxiety and depressive disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease.
Their characteristics and epidemiology, pathogenetic and clinical features, methods of diagnosis and treatment are presented.
Depression occurs in 40-50% of patients with PD, anxiety in 17-43% of patients.  Pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, is only one drug recommended for depression treatment.
Nortriptyline and desipramine, belonging to the group of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), are considered to be possibly effective.
There are no clear recommendations for treatment of anxiety.  In general, methods of therapy of anxiety and depressive disorders in PD are not well understood which determines the conduct of large-scale studies in the future.
