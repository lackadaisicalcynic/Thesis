[Robot-assisted and laparoscopic partial splenectomy for nonparasitic cysts].  21 patients with nonparasitic spleen cysts were operated.
Robot-assisted (RA) interventions were applied in 10 cases, laparoscopic--in 11 patients.
Men surgery duration was 124 minutes in case of RA-technique and 120 minutes if laparoscopy was used.
Blood loss was significantly lower in the group of RA resection (p=0.035).
There were no conversions of access in the group of RA-operations while in group of laparoscopy conversion has been required in 1 case.
We did not observe complications in case of RA-surgeries.
Laparoscopic method was associated with 2 complications (left-sided hydrothorax and fluid accumulation in resection area).
Postoperative hospital-stay did not differ in both groups and was 7.1 and 6.4 room-nights in case of RA-interventions and laparoscopy respectively.
There were no deaths.
Indications for robot-assisted partial splenectomy for nonparasitic cysts include location of mass in upper pole or hilus of spleen, its diameter more than 8 cm, body mass index more than 30 and splenomegaly.
Lower pole resection and splenectomy are more advisable using laparoscopic method.
