[The influence of the comprehensive spa and health resort-based treatment on the system of hormonal regulation in the women presenting with gynecological pathology depending on the plasma prolactin level].
AIM
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the comprehensive spa and health resort-based treatment on the system of hormonal regulation in the women presenting with bacterial vaginosis and concomitant chronic inflammatory diseases of the pelvic organs depending on the plasma prolactin level.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We investigated the indicators of hormonal regulation in 186 women suffering from bacterial vaginosis and concomitant chronic inflammatory diseases of the pelvic organs depending on the level of prolactin in blood plasma.  The first group consisted of 128 women with the normal plasma prolactin levels whereas the second group was comprised of 58 women having hyperprolactinemia.
The relevant laboratory data were obtained before and after peloid therapy.
RESULTS
The application of the therapeutic peloids for the treatment of the women presenting with the normal level of prolactin in blood plasma was shown to contribute to the positive clinical dynamics of the patients' condition and have a modulating effect on the level of pituitary hormones as well as a stimulating effect on the function of the ovaries.
The peloid therapy given to the women with hyperprolactinemia exacerbates the hormonal imbalance as a result of the increase of the initial level of prolactin, discoordination of the hormonal regulation at the level of the pituitary-ovarian system, and enhancement of the adrenal gland function regardless of the level of prolactin.  CONCLUSION
The results of the study give evidence of the possibility to use the plasma prolactin level as an indicator of the effectiveness of the spa and health resort-based treatment of the women presenting with gynecological pathology.
Moreover, they suggest the necessity of a differentiated approach to the application of the therapeutic peloids for the treatment of gynecological patients with the disturbances of the hormonal regulation taking into consideration the initial level of prolactin in the blood plasma and the presence of hyperprolactinemia prior to the prescription of the spa and health resort-based treatment including peloid therapy.
