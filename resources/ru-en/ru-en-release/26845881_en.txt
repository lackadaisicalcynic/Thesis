[Electrophysiological evaluation of retinal function after systemic and superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy for retinoblastoma].  Since the prognosis for visual acuity after polychemotherapy or superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy (SIACT) is doubtful, studying retinal function in children with retinoblastoma by means of clinical electroretinography (ERG) is a relevant issue.
The latter enables objective post-treatment assessment of retinal function and evaluation of possible infusion-related retinal toxicity.  This review analyzes ERG findings in children with retinoblastoma treated with chemotherapy, including SIACT.
