[Oral cavity and pharynx cancer in the region of Siberia and Far East].  The objective of the present work was to study the prevalence of malignant oral cavity and pharynx neoplasms among the population of the region of Siberia and Far East.
These neoplasms are the ninth most frequent conditions in the structure of malignant tumours among the male population and rank the eighteenth among the women.  On the whole, the morbidity rate of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer (3.8‱ and 2.0‱ respectively) was consistent with the mean morbidity levels in Russia.
The risk of the development of these conditions among the men is significantly higher than among the women.  The highest morbidity is recorded among the subjects at the age of 65-69 years.
It increases in the subjects of either sex at a rate that is 3.4 times higher in the women than in the men.
The study revealed the territories characterized ether by the enhanced or by the reduced risk of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer development.
The prevalence of this pathology was estimated at 28.4 per 100,000 population, with the overall active detectability being 11.8%, that of stage 1 an 2 disease 7.8% and 19.3% respectively.  One-year lethality was 35.6%.
The radical treatment was completed in 41.1% of the patients; 45.8% of them were followed up during 5 years.
It is concluded that the increasing oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer morbidity and the insufficient volume of preventive measures taken together suggest the necessity of closer cooperation of general practitioners and dental surgeons with oncologists.
