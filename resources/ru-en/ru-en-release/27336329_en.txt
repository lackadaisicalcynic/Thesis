Analysed herein are the results of treating a total of 139 patients presenting with stage II chronic lower limb ischaemia.
The patients were subdivided into three groups, depending on the variant of treatment performed.
Group One patients (n=57) received standard conservative therapy combined with ozone therapy, with the Group being further subdivided into two subgroups: patients of subgroup 1a (n=28) were subjected to intravenous administration of ozonated physiological solution (OPS), subgroup 1b patients (n=29) were given big autohemoozonetherapy (BAT).
Group Two patients (n=62) underwent complex treatment including beside medical ozone gravitation therapy (GT).
Group Two patients were also subdivided into two subgroups: subgroup 2a patients (n=31) received standard conservative therapy combined with OPS and GT, subgroup 2b patients (n=31) received standard conservative therapy in combination with BAT and GT.
Group Three (Control Group) was composed of 20 patients receiving standard conservative therapy alone.
The highest efficacy was observed in the subgroup of patients receiving OPS and GT, with the patients of this subgroup showing a statistically significant increase in the pain-free walking distance by 116.5% and in the ankle-brachial index by 49.2%, also demonstrating the most pronounced positive dynamics of lipid metabolism parameters: a decrease in total cholesterol by 21.3%, low density lipoproteins by 25.4%, very low density lipoproteins by 24.2% and triglycerides by 18.5%.
Besides, a tendency was observed towards normalization of the haemostasis system indices: fibrinogen decreased by 21.8%, prothrombin index by 13%, fibrin monomer complexes retraction by 18.2%, and the clotting time increased by 20.7%.
Hence, combined use of ozonated physiological solution and gravitation therapy in treatment of patients with stage II chronic lower limb ischaemia promotes a considerable increase in the pain-free walking distance and ankle-brachial index, as well as contributes to correction of lipid metabolic disorders and haemocoagulation.
