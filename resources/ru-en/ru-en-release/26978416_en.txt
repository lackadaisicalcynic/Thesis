[Matrix metalloproteinase 2, 3, and 9 gene polymorphisms in women with rheumatoid arthritis].
AIM  To study the promoter regions of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP3, and MMP9 genes to assess their associations with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and with the types of its clinical course in women.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
162 female patients with RA and 329 women without this condition were examined.
Polymorphisms in the gene promoter region for MMP2 (-1306 С→Т), MMP3 (-1171 5A→6А), and MMP9 (-1562 С→Т) were studied.
Genotyping was carried out using the restriction fragment length polymorphism method.
RESULTS
In the RA group, the -1306TT genotype of MMP2 was significantly more frequently encountered and the 6A6A genotype was less frequently seen.
In the seropositive RA group, the frequency of the -1306ТТ genotype of MMP2 was significantly higher than that in the healthy individuals.
The significant differences shown for the entire group of patients with RA were preserved when they were divided into groups according to the presence or absence of rheumatoid nodules.
Furthermore, the frequency of the homozygous -1306 genotypes of MMP2 was higher in both groups than in the healthy individuals.
CONCLUSION
The presence of the allelic variants of the MMP genes may be one of the genetic factors that predispose to RA in women.
