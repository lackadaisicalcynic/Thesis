[Coexpression of CD44 and Ki-67 in colon`s neoplast].  AIM  the evaluation of Ki-67 and CD44 expression in the 'serrated' polyps of the colon and comparison them with adenocarcinomas and tubular and tubule-villous adenomas of the colon.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study is including 49 'serrated' polyps, 34 tubular (AT) and tubulo-villous (ATV) adenomas and 32 adenocarcinomas of the colon.
Antibodies CD44 and Ki-67 were used as immunohistochemical markers in this study.
RESULTS
A statistically significant difference (p<0.01) was observed between traditional serrated adenomas (TSA) from hyperplastic polyps (HP) and sessile serrated adenomas (SSA) in the Ki-67 level and the localization of the Ki-67 and CD44 reaction: surface areas of the crypts (upper third) in TSA and base of crypts (lower third) in HP and SSA.
There was no difference between HP and SSA (p>0.05), neither by marker localization, nor by their level.
In all 'serrated' polyps of the colon, the Ki-67 reaction was nuclear; CD44 - membrane (except for 1 TSA).
CONCLUSION
we are the first ones who suggested to evaluate not the overall level of reactions of CD44 and Ki-67, but particular level for each third part of crypts.
The similarities of TSA, AT and ATV and between HP and SSA are shown as well as the principal statistical difference between these two groups.
The cytoplasmic reaction of CD44 in adenocarcinomas and the membrane reaction of CD44 in 98% of the 'serrated' polyps of the colon are described.
For the first time coexpression of CD44 and Ki-67 on particulate thirds of crypts in neoplasms of the colon is shown and the potential reasons for this phenomenon are discussed.
