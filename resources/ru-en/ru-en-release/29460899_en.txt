[The diagnostic significance of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials in different types of vertigo].
AIM  To study the parameters of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) in different types of vertigo.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Seventy-seven patients, 35 men and 42 women, aged 43.7±12.5 years, with vestibular vertigo and unsteadiness were examined.
The activity of the stemocleidomastoid muscle in response to auditory stimulation of the ipsilateral ear was recorded using surface electromyography.
RESULTS
There were a trend towards the increase in the N2 latency, the significant reduction of the P1-N2 amplitude (p<0,005) on both sides and significant changes in the coefficient of asymmetry.
Compared to healthy people, the P1 latency and asymmetry in P1 latency were significantly increased in patients with peripheral type of vertigo (p<0,005 and р=0,0007, respectively).
There were no differences in the P1 latency and N2 in patients with unsteadiness.
CONCLUSION
In patients with peripheral vertigo, central vertigo and unsteadiness, vestibular-spinal reflex was disturbed at different levels of vestibular analyzer.
