[Improving the effectiveness of orthodontic correction in children with malocclusion and musculoskeletal disorders].  The article discusses the choice of methods and the type of orthodontic equipment for correction of bite anomalies of different degree of severity in children who have concomitant diseases in the form of disorders of the musculoskeletal system (acquired deformities of the spine and feet).
To achieve this goal, the use of a decision-making program on the selection of therapeutic and prophylactic measures in children aged 6, 9 and 12 is proposed.
The software was developed on the basis of a statistical analysis of the results of the examination and correction of dentoalveolar anomalies, taking into account the severity of the disorders, the age of the patients.
The computer program allows you to predict the development of diseases, taking into account the implementation of treatment and prevention activities, as well as provide recommendations on the choice of methods and apparatus for correcting the pathology of bite in children with musculoskeletal disorders.
