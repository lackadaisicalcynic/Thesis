[The prevalence of bacterial overgrowth syndrome and its associated factors in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (according to the data of the Novosibirsk registry)].
AIM
To assess the prevalence of bacterial overgrowth syndrome (BOS) and its risk factors in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The patients from the Novosibirsk IBD registry, who had undergone a hydrogen breath test (HBT) using a Gastro+ device, were examined.  RESULTS
In 93 IBD patients who had undergone a HBD, the prevalence of BOS was 48% (46.2% for ulcerative colitis and 51.2% for Crohn's disease).
There was a strong correlation between abdominal bloating, abdominal rumbling, and positive HBT results in both patient groups.
During the HBT, the patients with BOS frequently complained of diarrhea, borborygmi, belching, and anxiety.  CONCLUSION
The findings suggest that BOS is highly prevalent among patients with IBD.  BOS is associated with clinical symptoms, such as abdominal bloating, abdominal rumbling, tearfulness, and irritability.
