[Immunohistochemical changes in the lungs from fetuses and newborn infants at 20- 40 weeks' gestation with false left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia].  OBJECTIVE  to study changes in the expression of growth factors in the lungs from fetuses and newborn infants at 20-40 weeks' gestation with false left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Lung fragments obtained at autopsies were examined using immunohistochemically stained paraffin sections.
The expression indices of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming grow factor-β (TGF-β) in the fetal lung sections were compared with the results of survey and elective staining techniques, the morphometric data of digitized lung sections, and the indicators obtained in the comparison group.
RESULTS
Morphofunctional changes in the connective tissue, pulmonary vessels, and bronchial and alveolar epithelium at 20-24, 25-27, and 28-40 weeks' gestation were characterized, partly explaining the development of bilateral pulmonary hypoplasia in CDH.
There was evidence for the involvement of PDGF, IGF-1, and EGF in primary pulmonary hypoplasia.
PDGF deficiency plays a certain role in secondary pulmonary hypoplasia.
CONCLUSION
The findings can be used in researches and in the practical work of pathologists and forensic medical experts.
