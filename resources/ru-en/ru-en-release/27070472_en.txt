[Glutamate dehydrogenase activity in platelets of patients with endogenous psychosis].
OBJECTIVE
to evaluation of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) enzymatic activity in platelets of patients with endogenous psychoses.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Enzymatic cectivity of GDH evaluated in 69 patients with schizophrenia (n=48) or schizoaffective disorder (n=21) in comparison with control group (n=34) and elucidation of possible link between their platelet GDH activity and clinical psychopathological condition.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Generally, GDH activity in patients before antipsychotic treatment was significantly lower, than in control group.
Significant differences were revealed in GDH activity before the treatment between subgroups of patients with first episode psychosis (FEP, n=34), chronic patients (n=35), and control group (n=34), wherein GDH activity correlated with PANSS in FEP patients before the treatment course.  No links were found in patients with chronic schizophrenia.
Besides, significant links between GDH activity determined before the treatment course and PANSS scores after the treatment were found in FEP patients: the higher were levels of platelet GDH activity in FEP patients, the lower were their PANSS scores after the treatment.  CONCLUSION
Initial (baseline) levels of platelet GDH activity can have value for prognosis of antipsychotic pharmacotherapy efficacy in patients with FEP.
