[Peculiarities of clinical and psychophysiological status of elderly patients with osteochondrosis.]
We conducted a study of 220 patients in polyclinic â„– 91 in St. Petersburg.  It was revealed that elderly patients with osteochondrosis are characterized by a high prevalence and severity of osteochondrosis against the background of metabolic disorders in the structures of the spine.
At the same time, the actual condition of the spine does not always determine the severity of the pain syndrome.
The effect of osteochondrosis on the development of comorbid pathology has been clarified.
The ways of correction of the clinical and psychophysiological status of elderly patients with osteochondrosis such as appointment of Cytoflavin, behavioral therapy and biofeed back therapy are suggested.
