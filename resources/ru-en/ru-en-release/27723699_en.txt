[Comparative results of use liver protecting drugs for prophylaxis of the liver failure after extensive resections of the liver].  After 100 extensive resections of a liver for excision of metastasises of a colorectal cancer, the different drugs protecting a liver were used for prophylaxis of a liver failure.
