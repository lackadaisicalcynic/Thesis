[The possibilities for determining the shooting distance by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the possibilities for determining the shooting distance for the MR-79-9 Makarych non-lethal pistol (diameter 9 mm, rubber bullet, shot energy 50 J) by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.
The experiments were carried under the conditions of a ballistic shooting range making the shots from a distance of 0 to 120 cm.
The 15Ã—15 cm pieces of muslin fabric and biomaterials (leather) were used as the targets.
The morphological signs of the damages inflicted to the targets were evaluated either with the unassisted eye, a criminalistical magnifying glass or the SMT-4 binocular stereoscopic microscope (Germany).
The shot products, the area and boundaries of their dispersion were determined in reflected IR and filtered UV rays.
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry was applied for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of various shot products from the entry hole zone with the contamination (wipedown) bands and contusion collars being 0.2-0.5 cm (group 1) and 2-3 cm (group 2) in width, with special reference to the identification of Ba, Cu, Cr, Fe, K, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn and Zn.
The results of the study give evidence that the detection of Ba, Pb, and Sb among the products of a shot fired from the MR-79-9 Makarych non-lethal pistol is of especially high informative value for determining the shooting distance whereas the detection of Cr, K, Sn and Ni is of a minimum value for this purpose.
