[The influence of STAT4 rs7574865 (G/T) polymorphism on the risk of clinical and immunological phenotypes of systemic sclerosis in a Russian patient population: Results of a pilot study].  AIM
To examine the association of signal transducer and activator transcription 4 (STAT4) rs7574865 G/T polymorphism with a predisposition to systemic sclerosis (SSC) and associated clinical and autoimmune phenotypes in a Russian population.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A total of 102 patients with SSC and 103 healthy individuals as controls were examined.
STAT4 rs7574865 polymorphism was investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS
The carriers of the T allele showed a statistically significant association with SSC, a diffuse form (DF), the presence of interstitial lung disease (ILD), cardiac injury (CI), and seropositivity for anti-topoisomerase I antibodies (ATA).
CONCLUSION
The findings results confirm the important role of STAT4 gene in the predisposition to SSC and its phenotypes, such as DF, ILD, CI, and ATA in the Russian population.
