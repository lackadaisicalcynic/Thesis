OBJECTIVE  To investigate the morphometric and optical coherence tomography (OCT) characteristics of the microstructure of retroperitoneal peripancreatic adipose tissue during passive drainage and active perfusion-aspiration drainage for infected pancreatic necrosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The authors analyzed 74 samples of peripancreatic adipose tissue obtained from 37 patients with passive (Group 1) and active perfusion-aspiration drainage (Group 2) of a focus of peripancreatitis.
The tissues were examined with OCT, then fixed in a formalin solution and underwent histological examination, including morphometric one.
RESULTS
The examined groups showed qualitative and quantitative differences in the tissue microstructure.
In Group 1 samples, the proportion (median (upper quartile; lower quartile)) of interlobular connective tissue was 5.6 (3.9; 6.1)%; and that of adipocytes was 44.6 (41.2; 51.6)%.
Necrotic tissue occupied 46.2 (35.6; 56.1)% of the area of specimens.
The OCT images of necrotic tissue displayed a preponderance of unstructured regions with a high signal level while the parenchymal areas showed a cellular structured pattern.
In Group 2 samples, the proportion of interlobular connective tissue was 16.2 (11.4; 19.7)%, and that of adipocytes was 68.5 (59.7; 71.2)%.
At the same time, Group 2 exhibited necrosis - 14.4 (11.5; 19.2%) that was 3.2 times less than in Group 1.
The OCT images of Group 2 samples showed a preponderance of cellular structured regions characteristic of the parenchyma, with pronounced stromal elements, which corresponded to the histological pattern.
CONCLUSION
Active perfusion-aspiration drainage of peripancreatic adipose tissue versus passive drainage is associated with a smaller proportion of necrotic tissue (14.4% versus 46.2%; p≤0.05) and a larger proportion of a stromal vascular component (16.2% vs. 5.6%; p≤0.05).
OCT could qualitatively distinguish viable fat tissue parenchyma from necrotic areas, without specially preparing the samples, which was confirmed by histomorphometric results.
