[Comparative study bone tissue temperature changes by using conventional and piezosurgical methods in dental implantology].  The laboratory study compared thermal bone lesion by the formation of dental implant bed using traditional and piezosurgical method with varying degrees of irrigation.
The study was carried out on cadaveric mandible and porcine mandible with preserved soft tissues.
Implant bed was formed by Implantmed dispenser (W&H, Austria) and AstraTech drills (Sweden) according to standard clinical protocol or by piezosurgical device Implant Center (Satelec Acteon Group, France) with Intra Lift II (Satelec Acteon Group, Франция) and №1 scalpel tips with D1 power under minimal and maximal irrigation.
The results showed that the formation of the bone bed was safe when using both conventional and piezosurgical method under copious irrigation.
The possibility of bone tissue thermal damage increases when using minimum irrigation or no irrigation.
