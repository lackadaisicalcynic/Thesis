[Comparative medical/social characteristics of psychiatric outpatients].
OBJECTIVE
to compare medical/social characteristics of psychiatric outpatients of rural and urban regions to optimize the activities of the regional mental health services.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Using an anonymous survey, 1042 psychiatric patients of the Orel Regional psychoneurological out-patient clinic have been examined.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Significant differences in the access to professional psychiatric and psychotherapeutic care between rural and urban populations of the region were shown.  To overcome the imbalance, decentralization of psychiatric care and its approach to the patients are needed.
