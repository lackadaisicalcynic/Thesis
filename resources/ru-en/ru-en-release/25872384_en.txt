[Effect of surgery on quality of life in patients with epiretinal membrane].
OBJECTIVE
To study the effect of surgical treatment on quality of life (QOL) in patients with epiretinal membrane (EM).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 48 patients who underwent surgical treatment for EM were examined.  QOL was assessed with the VFQ-25 questionnaire before and after the surgery (at 1 week and 6 months).
RESULTS
Before the surgery the total QOL index was significantly decreased by an average of 25% as compared with the controls (p<0.001).
In the late postoperative period there was a progressive increase in the total index of QOL up to the level of the control group (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION
Vitrectomy surgery improves visual functions and quality of life in patients with epiretinal membrane.
