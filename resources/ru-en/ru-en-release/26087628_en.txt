[Gender-related features of risk factors for, and age- and gender-related differences in the severity and genesis of chronic heart failure].  AIM
To analyze the gender-related features of the prevalence of chronic heart failure (CHF) in Azerbaijan and to estimate the detection rate and risk factors of this condition in inpatients on the basis of a retrospective follow-up study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 1824 case histories of CHF patients admitted with a CHF diagnosis to the Azerbaijan Research Institute of Cardiology in 2013 were analyzed.  RESULTS
The prevalence of CHF is 51.4% among the patients admitted to the Azerbaijan Research Institute of Cardiology.  The major etiological factors of CHF are ischemic heart disease (IHD) and hypertension in 79.9% of the.
There are gender-related differences in the pattern of cardiovascular diseases in the patients with CHF: IHD (prior myocardial infarction) and hypertension are more common in men and women, respectively.
The incidence of CHF was 56.8% among the men; it was registered in them 1.3-fold more often than in the women; 41% of the patients with CHF were older than 60 years.
CHF with a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 45% was diagnosed in 84% of the patients.
Among the patients with CHF and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, the number of women rose up to 22%, which was twice higher than that for the men.
CONCLUSION
Substantial differences were found in the etiology of CHF in men and women, as well as in patients of different ages.
