[Radiotherapy and radiosurgery in treatment of craniopharyngiomas].  Craniopharyngiomas are benign epithelial tumors having a dysembryogenetic origin, which are usually located in the sellar/parasellar and/or third ventricle regions.
Gross total resection is the modern standard of treatment for these tumors because of a low recurrence rate.
However, this surgery in some patients with craniopharyngioma often leads to the development or worsening of diencephalic disorders poorly responding to treatment.
Perhaps, in these cases, subtotal or partial tumor resection or implantation of an Ommaya reservoir into the tumor cyst followed by stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery may provide better functional outcomes and higher life quality in patients, with tumor growth control being reasonable (according to the published data, the mean 10-year disease-free survival is 66.9% after total tumor resection and 79.6% after combined treatment).
The paper presents a review of the literature on radiological treatment of craniopharyngiomas.
We discuss the issues of indications, optimal timing of radiotherapy/radiosurgery, its efficacy, and treatment outcomes in terms of complications and quality of life.
Particular attention is paid to enlargement of craniopharyngioma cysts during and after radiological treatment.
