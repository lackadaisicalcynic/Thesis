Improving eye care in Rwanda.
PROBLEM  Visual impairment affects nearly 285 million people worldwide.
Although there has been much progress in combating the burden of visual impairment through initiatives such as VISION 2020, barriers to progress, especially in African countries, remain high.
APPROACH
The Rwandan Ministry of Health has formed partnerships with several nongovernmental organizations and has worked to integrate their efforts to prevent and treat visual impairment, including presbyopia.
LOCAL SETTING
Rwanda, an eastern African country of approximately 11 million people.
RELEVANT CHANGES
The Rwandan Ministry of Health developed a single national plan that allows key partners in vision care to coordinate more effectively in measuring eye disease, developing eye care infrastructure, building capacity, controlling disease, and delivering and evaluating services.  LESSONS LEARNT
Collaboration between stakeholders under a single national plan has ensured that resources and efforts are complementary, optimizing the ability to provide eye care.  Improved access to primary eye care and insurance coverage has increased demand for services at secondary and tertiary levels.
A comprehensive strategy that includes prevention as well as a supply chain for glasses and lenses is needed.
