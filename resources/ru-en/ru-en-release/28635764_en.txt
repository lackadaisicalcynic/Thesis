[Thrombosis of the cerebral veins in gynecological practice].  The review presents literature data on the risk factors of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), a rare life threatening disorder.
Currently, the diagnosis of CVT is made more often due to the possibility of using neuroimaging methods of cerebral structures.  Pregnancy, postpartum period, use of oral contraceptives are risk factors of CVT.
A role of thrombophilia, in particular Factor V Leiden mutations and the prothrombin G20210A polymorphism, in the CVT pathogenesis is confirmed.
The development of CVT is an example of the interaction between persistent risk factors increasing the likelihood of thrombotic complications and acquired risk factors.
A focal neurological deficit during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period is the best indicator of CVT diagnosis.
Possibilities of the use of anticoagulants in treatment and prevention of CVT are analyzed.
