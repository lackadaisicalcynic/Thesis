[Skin morphology in congenital ichthyosis (Harlequin fetus)].  The paper describes a skin morphological examination using an immunohistochemical study (Ki-67, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, and CK LMW) in a dead 4-month-old girl with congenital ichthyosis (Harlequin ichthyosis (HI)).
There is impaired proliferative activity, abnormalities in epidermal differentiation with abnormal CK LMW synthesis, and those in the differentiation of the skin appendages.
There are also pronounced sclerotic changes with a predominance of reticulin fibers, derma, and its vessels.
The patient with HI and trichoepithelioma is noted to have the similar immunohistochemical phenotype of hair bulbs.
