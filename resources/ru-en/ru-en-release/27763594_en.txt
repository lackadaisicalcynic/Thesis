[The forensic medical implications of the determination of the species composition of necrophilic dipterans].
The objective of the present work was to study the species composition of necrophilic dipterans and their participation in corpse decomposition.
The material for the study was collected from the swine corpses weighing from 50 to 70 kg and from the dead human bodies in Karelia during the period from 2014 to 2015.  It was shown that 8 dipteran species belonging to 5 families contribute to corpse decomposition in the European part of Russia.
They are dominated by Protophormia terraenovae and Calliphora vicina.  The quantitative composition of the necrophilic dipterans developing in human and animal corpses differ depending on the local environmental conditions.
