[Clinical manifestations of asthma during combination therapy using ceruloplasmin].
AIM  To estimate the time course of clinical changes in patients with asthma during combination therapy using ceruloplasmin (CP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 92 asthmatic patients were examined.
Their medical history data were collected; external lung function testing and clinical, laboratory, and instrumental examinations, involving the determination of the indicators of lipid peroxidation (LPO) (malonic dialdehyde (MDA), methemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin) and the antioxidant system (superoxide dismutase (COD), sulfhydryl groups), were performed in all the patients over time.
According to the therapy used, the patients were divided into 2 groups matched for gender, age, and clinical manifestations of the disease.
A study group consisted of 45 patients who took CP in addition to conventional therapy.
A comparison group included 47 patients receiving standard therapy.
RESULTS
During the combination therapy using CP, the asthmatic patients showed a reduction in the elevated concentrations of MDA, methemoglobin, and carboxyhemoglobin and increases in the activity of COD and in the levels of sulfhydryl groups, which was followed by a considerable clinical improvement.
During the conventional therapy, the indicators of LPO remained high and those of the antioxidant system did low, suggesting permanent oxidative stress.
CONCLUSION
CP incorporation into the combination therapy of asthmatic patients contributes to elimination of prooxidant-antioxidant imbalance, which is followed by a marked positive clinical effect.
