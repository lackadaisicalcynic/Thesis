[Endovascular interventions for acute ischemia of intestine].  It is presented 5 clinical observations of acute ischemia of intestine in which different endovascular interventions including isolated superior mesenteric artery stenting, rheolytic and aspiration thrombectomy and combination of techniques were applied.
Surgical success with blood flow restoration in superior mesenteric artery was achieved in 4 of 5 patients.
2 patients have required laparotomy and intestinal resection.
In 1 case extent of resection was significantly reduced after previous endovascular thrombectomy.
There were no deaths.
It is concluded that endovascular interventions may be considered as independent method of treatment of patients with acute mesenteric ischemia.
