[Custom-made artificial parts for improving functional and cosmetic results of ocular prosthetics].
UNLABELLED
Aim - to justify the use of custom-made ocular prostheses aimed at better functional and cosmetic outcomes.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cosmetic outcomes in 520 patients operated for either anophthalmia (89.1%), or ocular subatrophy (6.7%), or congenital micro-/anophthalmia have been analyzed.
General and ophthalmic assessment was performed.
RESULTS  Relationships were investigated between the results obtained in a particular patient, on the one hand, and primary etiology in his/her case, eye removal technique, postoperative management details, complications, treatments, and preventive measures, on the other.
It has been found that, if aiming to avoid the development of anophthalmic syndrome, the choice of surgical technique should be done most carefully so that a muscle stump could be formed and primary prosthesis inserted.  Indications for the use of complexly shaped ocular prostheses have been identified.
We have also explored the possibilities for correction of cosmetic defects associated with the use of modified stock prostheses.  Moreover, in this article particular attention is paid to the importance of cooperation between the oculoplastic surgeon and the ocularist in order to ensure timely orbital reconstruction.
CONCLUSION
Indications for the use of custom-made ocular prostheses of complex shapes have been identified.  The range of complications that may arise from their irrational use are discussed.
