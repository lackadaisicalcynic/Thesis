[The application of ultrasound for diagnostics of middle ear pathologies].  The objective of the present work was to summarize the results of the application of ultrasound tests for differential diagnostics of various diseases and lesions affecting the middle ear.
Almost 7.000 threshold and suprathreshold studies were carried out in the patients presenting with various forms of sensorineural impairment of hearing.
The ultrasound investigations were conducted with the use of the EKHOTEST-02 apparatus (Giperion, Moscow).
The results of determination of threshold hearing sensitivity to ultrasound and lateralization of its threshold and suprathreshold values suggest their significance for the detection of even such a minimal disturbance in the cochlear function as the phenomenon of accelerated increase in loudness and the associated enhancement of the severity of the damage to the peripheral sensory system.
