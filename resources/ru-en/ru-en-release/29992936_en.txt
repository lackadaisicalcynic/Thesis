[Treatment of traumatic prosthetic stomatitis in elderly and senium people with 'dry mouth' syndrome].
There was clinical observation of the treatment of traumatic prosthetic stomatitis in 44 people (9 men and 35 women) aged 61 and 82 years suffering from 'dry mouth' syndrome due to radiation and (or) drug sialoadenopathies developed after combined treatment of malignant neoplasms of the organs of the oropharyngeal zone.  Using semi-quantitative method, a comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of a new drug based on chelate organic germanium guanine complex, sodium alginate and xylitol (main study group) and previously used drug (control group) for local therapy of traumatic lesions of the oral mucosa was made.
It was found that on day 9 in the main study group the effectiveness of treatment was significantly higher (95.0%) than in the control group (80.8%).
