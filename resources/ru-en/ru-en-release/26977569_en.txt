[Use of Myrtol standardized in the treatment of children with acute rhinosinusitis].  The present study included 60 children at the age from 6 to 10 years undergoing a course of out-patient and in-patient treatment of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS).
Thirty of these patients were given Myrtol standardised in the dose of 120 mg thrice daily for 7 days, in addition to traditional therapy.
With convincing objective data for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (in accordance with the criteria of EP3OS 2012), antibacterial preparations were prescribed to the children.
The remaining patients received either conventional (symptomatic, irrigation) therapy or systemic antimicrobial agents.
The analysis of characteristics of the visual-analog scale reflecting the severity of rhinorrhea, basal congestion, and coughing has demonstrated a significant (р<0,05) difference between the two groups of children in terms of manifestations of the clinical symptoms within days 7 and 14 after the onset of the treatment.  For basal congestion, the difference was apparent as soon as day 3 after the beginning of therapy.
The duration of the treatment with intranasal vasoconstrictive medications used for symptomatic therapy by the patients given Myrtol standardized was 2.2±0.4 days in comparison with 3.6±0.5 days in the control group.
None of the patients treated with GeloMyrtol exhibited any adverse reaction attributable to the action of the medication in being studied.
The study has demonstrated that using Myrtol standardized for the treatment of the uncomplicated forms of acute rhinosinusitis in children is clinically effective, safe, and convenient method for the management of ARS in children.  And it can be recommended for the wide practical application.
