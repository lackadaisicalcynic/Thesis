[Possibilities of retention of work capacity in patients with Parkinson's disease].
AIM
To study the efficacy of replacement of the single daily dose of two-component levodopa by three-component levodopa in work capable patients with Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations during the most active working hours.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 157 patients from 19 Russian centers specialized in extrapyramidal pathology.  The period of highest working activity was analyzed in all patients.
In these patients, the previous treatment with two-component levodopa was replaced by three-component levodopa in the equivalent dose.
Other antiparkinsonian treatment remained unchanged during the study period.
The duration of the study was 1 month.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The single replacement of two-component levodopa by stalevo allows increasing the optimal working activity by 19% and improving patient's state.
