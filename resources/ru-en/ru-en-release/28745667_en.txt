[Prevention and correction of cognitive dysfunction after general anesthesia].
AIM
To evaluate clinical efficacy of intraoperative use of cytoflavin in the prevention and correction of cognitive functions in surgical patients with no history of neurological and psychosomatic disorders.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 60 female patients who underwent surgery on the thyroid gland.  Patients were stratified into two equal groups matched for main indices.
Patients of the main group received infusions of cytoflavin (20 ml in 200 ml of 5% glucose solution).
Patients underwent thyroidectomy with general inhalation anesthesia using desflurane.  Cognitive testing was performed one day before operation and 6, 24 and 48 h after.
Waking time after stopping desflurane administration and time prior tracheal extubation were recorded.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The use of cytoflavin promoted the early post anesthesia adaptation and more rapid recovery of initial cognitive status of the patients.
