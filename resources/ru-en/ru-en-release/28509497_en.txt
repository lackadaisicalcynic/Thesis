[Metabolic risk factors in patients 60 years and older with arterial hypertension, living in extreme conditions of the Far North].  To evaluate the criteria of metabolic syndrome (MS) in elderly, 505 men aged 60-99 years, with hypertension, indigenous and non-indigenous ethnic group living in the extreme conditions of the Far North were studied.
The analysis of anthropometric parameters revealed that height, body weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, the ratio of waist to hip size, waist to growth were significantly lower in the elderly and senile Yakuts compared with those of non-indigenous ethnicity (p<0,001).
Ethnic differences were found in SBP and DBP levels (p<0,001).
The obtained results suggest that in elderly, old age patients and centenarians living in the Far North, almost all analyzed parameters of the metabolic syndrome were significantly correlated with abdominal obesity (p<0,001).
