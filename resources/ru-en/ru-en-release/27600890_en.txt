[Parameters of ocular hydrodynamics in case of major neck blood vessels compression by thyroid nodules].
AIM
to study aqueous humor secretion and outflow in patients, whose major blood vessels of the neck got compressed by thyroid nodules.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ocular hydrodynamics was assessed in 60 patients (119 eyes) with uni- or bilateral benign thyroid nodules compressing the major neck blood vessels.  RESULTS
Most patients demonstrated a significant decrease in parameters of aqueous humor secretion and outflow.  After decompression, ocular hydrodynamics usually improved reaching its normal level.
CONCLUSION
Compression of the major neck blood vessels by thyroid nodules impedes drainage of the aqueous humor and serves as a risk factor of secondary phlebohypertensive glaucoma.
