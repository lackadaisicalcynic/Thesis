[Melatonin as an inducing factor for multiple sclerosis].
Melatonin is one of the most multifunctional regulators in the organism.  It plays a key role in the control of nerve, endocrine, and immune systems.
Due to hormone neuroprotective activity, the possibility is now discussed on its clinical usage in treating neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis.  At the same time, melatonin is an effective regulator of immune reactions, in part, the reactions toward autoantigens.
In this respect, the subset ofT lymphocytes producing IL-17 (Th17) is of special interest.  As the Th17 subset plays a key role iri multiple sclerosis pathogenesis, the immunomodulating hormone effects toward Th17, may, in theory, nullify its positive neuroprotective activity.
