[Neurobiological perspectives of biofeedback-therapy efficiency of migraine in patints with epilesy].
AIM
Efficiency of BFB-therapy was studied by EMG and temperature parameters under migraine in patients with epilepsy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
14 patients with epilepsy with different localization of epileptic foci were examined.
For the estimation of migraine pain syndrome the clinic-psychological scaled of pain, anxiety and depression were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The estimation of compared efficiency of the temperature and EMG BFB therapy showed more advisable using of temperature BFB therapy in the group with migraine-epilepsy seizures in the group with localization in temporal area of the right hemisphere.
