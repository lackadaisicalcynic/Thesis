The G7 presidency and universal health coverage, Japan's contribution.
Problem  If universal health coverage (UHC) is to be achieved globally, it needs sustained promotion and political awareness and support.
Approach
During its presidency of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations in 2016, Japan aimed to raise the issue of UHC to the top of the global health agenda.
Local setting
Japan has promoted a health agenda at all of the G7 summits since 2000 that it has hosted.
Human security has been the core foundation of Japan's foreign diplomacy for several decades and, consequently, there was no apparent opposition within Japan to the inclusion of UHC on the agenda of the summit in 2016.  Other G7 governments appeared keen to promote such coverage.
Relevant changes  Since the 2016 summit, UHC has remained a central agenda item for the United Nations and World Health Organization, even though the leaders of both these global organizations have changed.
In 2017, Japan hosted the UHC Forum in Tokyo.  The participants, who were the heads of United Nations agencies, politicians and other decision-makers from all over the world, showed their continued commitment towards UHC.
Lessons learnt
In the raising of awareness of an item on the global health agenda, high-level champions are critical.  Although they may be very diverse, all relevant stakeholders need to be connected and allowed to discuss policies with each other.
Having too many allies can, however, lead to policy fragmentation, especially when there is commitment from the highest echelons within each country.
