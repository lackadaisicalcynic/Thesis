[Dynamics of indicators of the functional state of the central nervous system in Navy operators treated with cytoflavin after a long working cycle].
AIM
To evaluate the efficacy of cytoflavin in the correction of functional state and working ability of Navy operators after a long working cycle.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Results of the examination of 25 Navy operators, aged from 27 to 42 years, were analyzed at baseline and after treatment with cytoflavin.  The Rusalov questionnaire for Individuality Formal Dynamic Properties and EEG were used to evaluate the state of participants.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The results demonstrate the ability of cytoflavin to exert the positive effect on the energetic component of the functional state of Navy operators after a long working cycle, increasing the psychomotor activity and optimizing the spontaneous electrical activity of the brain.
The activation of energetic potential, physical activity and emotional reactions by cytoflavin is correlated with the growth of the central nervous system reserves in Navy operators treated after a long working cycle.
