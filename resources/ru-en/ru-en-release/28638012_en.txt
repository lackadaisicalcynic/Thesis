[Comparative analysis of laparotomy closure techniques].  AIM
To assess experimentally different laparotomy closure techniques.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Experimental research on laboratory animals was performed.
Laboratory animals underwent laparotomy followed by aponeurosis suturing by using of interrupted, continuous suture and continuous suture with an arrangement of stitches at different levels.
Tensometric and histological examination of tissue specimens together with sutures was made in 7, 14, 60 days after surgery.
RESULTS
Correlation of laparotomy closure technique with values of durability, elasticity and wound process course was obtained.
CONCLUSION
Continuous suture after laparotomy promotes the formation of more mature granulation tissue and more solid scar with low elasticity compared with interrupted sutures.
