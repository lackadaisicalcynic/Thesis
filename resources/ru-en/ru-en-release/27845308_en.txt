[Cerebral venous thrombosis].  There is ample evidence that arterial and venous links of the vascular bed are interrelated, with the venous part, as the highly organized reflexogenic zone, responsible for the development of complex reactions providing the stability of the cerebral blood flow.
There is few publications devoted to the venous pathology of the brain however the prevalence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is relatively high.
The annual prevalence of CVT is 4-7 per 1 million of population.
Timely recognition and early diagnosis of CVT are most important for successful treatment of patients.  It can lead to effective therapy, decrease the consequences of this disease and the fatal outcomes.
The review and systematization of the literature on the epidemiology, etiology, risk factors, clinical presentations, diagnosis and treatment of CVT are presented.
