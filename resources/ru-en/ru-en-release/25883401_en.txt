An observational study of adults seeking emergency care in Cambodia.
OBJECTIVE  To describe the characteristics and chief complaints of adults seeking emergency care at two Cambodian provincial referral hospitals.
METHODS
Adults aged 18 years or older who presented without an appointment at two public referral hospitals were enrolled in an observational study.
Clinical and demographic data were collected and factors associated with hospital admission were identified.
Patients were followed up 48 hours and 14 days after presentation.
FINDINGS
In total, 1295 hospital presentations were documented.
We were able to follow up 85% (1098) of patients at 48 hours and 77% (993) at 14 days.
The patients' mean age was 42 years and 64% (823) were females.
Most arrived by motorbike (722) or taxi or tuk-tuk (312).
Most common chief complaints were abdominal pain (36%; 468), respiratory problems (15%; 196) and headache (13%; 174).
Of the 1050 patients with recorded vital signs, 280 had abnormal values, excluding temperature, on arrival.
Performed diagnostic tests were recorded for 539 patients: 1.2% (15) of patients had electrocardiography and 14% (175) had diagnostic imaging.
Subsequently, 783 (60%) patients were admitted and 166 of these underwent surgery.
Significant predictors of admission included symptom onset within 3 days before presentation, abnormal vital signs and fever.
By 14-day follow-up, 3.9% (39/993) of patients had died and 19% (192/993) remained functionally impaired.
CONCLUSION
In emergency admissions in two public hospitals in Cambodia, there is high admission-to-death ratio and limited application of diagnostic techniques.
We identified ways to improve procedures, including better documentation of vital signs and increased use of diagnostic techniques.
