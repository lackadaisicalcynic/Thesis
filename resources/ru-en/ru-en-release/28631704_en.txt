[Behçet's disease: Intracardiac thrombosis (a description of two cases and a review of literature)].  Behçet's disease (BD) is systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology, which is more common in the countries located along the Great Silk Road.
The disease is diagnosed if a patient has 4 key diagnostic signs: aphthous stomatitis, genital sores, and eye and skin lesions.  Vascular diseases referred to as minor criteria for BD are characterized by the formation of aneurysms and thrombosis, predominantly in the venous bed.
In venous disorders, a blood clot can form in any vessel, including caval, cerebral, pulmonary, and other veins.  The paper describes two clinical cases of BD with intracardiac thrombosis.
In one case, a 24-year-old male patient with a documented diagnosis of BD, echocardiography revealed a left ventricular spontaneous echo contrast phenomenon that disappeared due to immunosuppressive therapy.
The other case was a 34-year-old female patient, in whom the diagnosis was based on the international disease criteria: aphthous stomatitis, skin lesions (pseudopustulosis, erythema nodosum), and genital sores.
Computed tomographic angiography showed a 3.7×2.2-cm mass (thrombus) in the right atrium.
In addition, blood clots were present in the hepatic and inferior vena cava.
No abnormalities in the coagulation system were found in both cases.
