[The mechanical strenth characteristics of the biological tissues: the current state-of-the-art].
This article reports the results of analysis of the publications in the scientific literature concerning the mechanical strength characteristics of the biological (human) tissues.  It is shown that many researchers successfully used the methods and means finding wide applications in the technical disciplines for the investigations into the mechanical strength of such biological objects as skin, tendons, blood vessels, bones, etc. There are thus far no available reports on the studies of the mechanical strength characteristics of the internal organs.
At the same time, such studies are of paramount importance for obtaining the materials that might greatly contribute to the better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of the lesions in the internal organs.  They are likely to enhance objectiveness of expert conclusions in the framework of forensic medical expertise of the injuries to the human body.
