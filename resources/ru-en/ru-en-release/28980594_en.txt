[Sintopy of the distal end of the nasolacrimal duct detected by means of the vector analysis of the CT-identified anatomical features of the nasal cavity].
The objective of the present work was to study syntopy of the distal end of the nasolacrimal duct based on the results of the vector analysis of the CT-identified anatomical features of the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses in 102 patients (204 nasolacrimal channels).
The main criterion for inclusion in the study was the absence of traumatic injuries and inflammatory changes in the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses.
X-ray studies of the distal end of the nasolacrimal duct (NLD), turbinate crest (crista conchalis), the edge of the nasal aperture, and the floor of the nasal cavity were carried out.
The vector and angle measurements were made with respect to the bottom of the nasal cavity in the perpendicular and parallel planes.
The study has demonstrated that the distal end of the nasolacrimal duct was located 3.49 mm above the level of crista conchalis of the maxillary bone 19.77 mm and 22.04 mm apart from the edge of the aperture of the nose in the individuals younger than 20 years and in the older subjects respectively.
Syntopy of the distal end of NLD relative to the bottom of the nasal cavity did not depend on the sex and age of the patients and was localized at a depth of 13.93 mm from the edge of the aperture of the bone and 11.86 mm above the bottom of the nose.
