[Morphological changes in the respiratory organs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].  The basis for airway remoldeling in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is tissue changes contributing to thickening of the walls of the airway and its obstruction.
As the disease becomes severer, there are increases in mucosal metaplasia, submucosal hypertrophy, peribronchial fibrosis, and airway smooth muscle mass.
Drug therapy for COPD does not virtually lead to regression of airway obstruction, except when eosinophilia is present.
