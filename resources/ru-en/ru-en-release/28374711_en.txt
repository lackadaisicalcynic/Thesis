[Pathogenic aspects of stomach ulcerogenesis in acute intestinal obstruction].
AIM  To identify the patterns and the correlation of morphological and functional changes in stomach wall with the dynamics of different types of acute intestinal obstruction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was performed on 33 adult mongrel dogs of both genders weighing 17-20 kg.  All researches were conducted in accordance with the documents, such as the 'Guide for the Care and Use of laboratory animals of the National Institute of Health (National Institute of Health - NIH, Bethesda, USA)' and 'Rules of work with experimental animals'.
The same methods were used to study the morphology of stomach wall in normal conditions and after intestinal obstruction simulation.
We used H & E stain, Van Gieson's picrofuchsin staining combined with Mallory.
The choice of histochemical methods was determined by the need to study metabolic processes in epithelial cells and gastric mucosa glands.
Einarson method for detecting total nucleic acids was used.
The last group of methods was statistical analysis.
RESULTS
We determined the regularities of structural organization of microcirculation in various parts of the stomach, the correlation of morphological and functional changes in stomach wall with the dynamics of different types of acute intestinal obstruction.
CONCLUSION
Our data indicate proximal-distal gradient of gastric perfusion: the most pronounced vascular network and maximum blood flow are observed in proximal stomach in both normal conditions and acute intestinal obstruction.
More tenuous and reduced blood flow was revealed in the antrum, that is morphological basis of the most frequent localization of acute ulcers in this department.
