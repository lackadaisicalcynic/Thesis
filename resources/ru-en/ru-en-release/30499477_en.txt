[Extended amniotic fluid embolism associated with labor].  The authors report two cases of extended amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) associated with the birth-giving process with the analysis of their causes and the discussion of the possible pathways through which the amniotic fluid penetrates into maternal blood.
A rare cause of amniotic fluid embolism due to the rupture of placental membranes as a result of submembranous hemorrhage is described.
The changes in the lungs associated with extended AFE are apparent in the presence of macroscopic emboli formed from the particles of the amniotic fluid.
The article describes for the first time in the Russian-language literature the macroscopically visible emboli composed of the particles of the amniotic fluid present in the pulmonary blood vessels.  It is also the first report of the rupture of the placental membranes resulting from subamniotic hemorrhage as a cause of the appearance of the amniotic fluid in the maternal circulation.
