[Restoring of the speech functions in patients with aphasia in the early rehabilitation period of ischemic stroke].
AIM
To study the efficacy of combined therapy including daily sessions and two 10-day injections of the drug cellex in patients with aphasia in the early rehabilitation period of ischemic stroke (II).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty patients in the early rehabilitation period of II in the basin of the left middle cerebral artery with moderate to severe aphasia were studied.  Twenty patients received combined therapy, including daily sessions with a speech therapist-aphasiologist within 10 days using the improved method, then a self-study using educational materials and two 10-day injections of cellex.
Other 20 patients received only speech therapy.  To assess the efficacy of therapy, the automated "Program of examination of patients with aphasia", Goodglass-Kaplan scale, modified Rankin scale were used.
RESULTS
There was a significant improvement of speech functions, communicative abilities and functional recovery (p<0.01) in patients of both groups.  However, a significantly greater level of rehabilitation (p<0.05) was noted in patients treated with combined therapy included two courses of cellex.
CONCLUSION  The results allow to recommend the inclusion of cellex in the complex rehabilitation of patients with post-stroke speech disorders.
