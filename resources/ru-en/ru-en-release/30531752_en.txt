[Perforated duodenal ulcer in high risk patients].
AIM
To improve the outcomes in patients with perforated duodenal ulcers.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cohort study included 456 patients with perforated duodenal ulcer.  High risk of mortality was determined in 9% of patients (n=40) considering Boey diagnostic criteria (1982, 1987).
There were 19 women and 21 men aged 59Â±2.8 years.
RESULTS
Perforated duodenal ulcer was followed by overall mortality near 3.8%.
In high risk group this value was 17.5% (7 out of 40 patients) while expected mortality was 45.5-100% in these patients in view of Boey criteria.  The main causes of death were multiple organ failure, pulmonary embolism and acute myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSION  Minimally invasive surgery including step-by-step procedures (mini-laparotomy, laparoscopy and navigation) are the key to improve the outcomes in patients with perforated duodenal ulcer.
