[Eating disorders in psychiatric patients during treatment with second generation antipsychotics].
AIM
To identify the frequency and characteristics of eating disorders in patients with schizophrenia treated with second generation antipsychotics.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A sample included 56 patients (48 women and 8 men, mean age 28 ± 4.5 years) with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
Patients received risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine.  The study employed clinical-anamnestic, endocrinological methods and assessment of eating behavior with DEBQ (The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire).
All of the patients had extra Body mass or obesity: extra Body mass of the 1st grade was found in 18 patients (BMI<30 kg/m²) and obesity grade 2-3 in 38 patients (BMI>30 kg/m²).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Authors identified different types of eating disorders: external, restrictive and emotiogenic as well as the relationship of their prevalence and severity with sex, drug, presence and grade of obesity.  Based on these
RESULTS  we developed recommendations for management of patients treated with second generation antipsychotics.
