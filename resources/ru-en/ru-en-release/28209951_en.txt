[Clinical evaluation of endoscopic hemostasis in patients with ulcerative gastroduodenal bleeding].
AIM
To compare the effectiveness of various methods of endoscopic hemostasis in patients with ulcerative gastroduodenal bleeding.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Several surgical techniques in treatment of 117 patients with ulcerative gastroduodenal bleeding were anayzed.  Isolated and combined methods of endoscopic hemostasis were used in control and study groups.
RESULTS
Combined endoscopic hemostasis is bettercompared with isolated techniques.  It reduces the incidence of recurrence, surgical activity and mortality.
CONCLUSION
The effectiveness of combined endoscopic hemostasis was 88.2% for primary hemostasis in acute ulcerative gastroduodenal bleeding.
Herewith, surgical activity and mortality were decreased.
