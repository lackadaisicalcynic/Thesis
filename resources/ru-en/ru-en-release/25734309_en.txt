[The influence of gel-like recombinant interferon α-2b on the clinical course of acute respiratory infection and the state of mucosal immunity in the pregnant women].
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the state of local immunity of the mucous membrane in the nose of the pregnant women presenting with acute respiratory infection (ARI).
A total of 55 women with this condition were examined at the outpatient basis starting from week 14 of the gestation period.  Viferon gel was administered intranasally to 34 such patients.
The clinical and immunological effectiveness of the application of the topical form of this recombinant interferon α-2b preparation in these patients was evaluated.  It is concluded that the inclusion of Viferon in the combined treatment of ARI in the pregnant women significantly decreases the frequency of bacterial complications.
Simultaneously, this preparation reduces the IL-8 level in the nasal secretion in comparison with its initial value.
