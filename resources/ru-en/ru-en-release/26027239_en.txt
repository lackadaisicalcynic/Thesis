[Clinical value of surfactant protein D as a biomarker of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with scleroderma systematica in relation to the presence of gastroesophageal reflux].  AIM
To study the role of serum surfactant protein D (SP-D) as a biomarker of lung injury in scleroderma systematica (SDS) in relation to the presence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER).  SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Fifty-six patients (mean age 46Â±14 years) with diffuse and circumscribed SDS were examined and underwent pulmonary functional tests, X-ray and, if lung injury was present, high-resolution computed tomography of the lung, echocardiography, gastroduodenoscopy, and barium X-ray of the esophagus; an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine serum SP-D levels.  RESULTS
SP-D concentrations significantly correlate with the presence of lung injury in SDS and are significantly higher in the presence of pulmonary fibrosis and the signs of frosted glass and honeycomb lung patterns.  SP-D levels were higher in the patients with lung injury and SDS in the group of those with pulmonary fibrosis and GER than in the group of pulmonary fibrosis patients without the latter.
CONCLUSION
Serum SP-D may be considered in a number of biomarkers for the severity of lung injury in SDS, including GER-associated lung injury.
