The objective of the present work was to study the influence of allelic variant associations of 1-beta interleukin (C3953T, &511C, T31C), interleukin-6 (C174G), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (G308A) gene polymorphisms on the serum cytokine level in the patients presenting with chronic suppurative otitis media.
A total of 299 patients at the age varying from 16 to 55 years with this condition divided into three groups were examined.
Group 1 was comprised of 146 patients suffering from the tubotympanic form of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).
Group 2 was composed of 153 patients with epitympanic antral form of this condition.
The control group included 183 subjects who have never suffered pathological changes in the middle ear.
Human genomic DNA was analyzed with the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  The serum cytokine levels were measured by the solid-state enzyme immunoassay in the beginning and at the end of the treatment period.
The study has demonstrated that 56.2% of the healthy residents of the trans-Baikal region had the C/T Il-1b (C3953T) genotype.
79.1% of the patients presenting with the carious carious-destructive form of chronic suppurative otitis media were the heterozygous carriers of the T511C gene of 1-beta interleukin and had the maximally high concentrations of this interleukin in the blood serum.
A rise in the production of the pro-inflammatory mediator (IL-6) was found to be related to the severity of the inflammatory process in the middle ear.
The TNF-alpha content in the patients with CSOM during the active period of the disease proved to increase by a factor of 6 in comparison with that in the subjects of the control group irrespective of the type of mutation.
