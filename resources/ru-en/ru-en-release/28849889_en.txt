[Pineamin increased pineal melatonin synthesis in elderly people].  It was investigated the influence of polypeptide complex Pineamin on the 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6S) excretion in urine by ELISA test of 55 elderly patients with diminished melatoninsynthesis pineal gland function.
Pineamin in course dose 100 mg has increased night level of aMT6S urine excretion in 1,9 times in comparison with relevant value untreated.
Similar effect was obtained early for medical drug Epithalamin.  Epithalamin also restored melatonin level in human and animals during aging.
Thus, Pineamin and Epithalamin have similar stimulate effect on melatonin synthesis in elderly people pineal gland.
