[Extracorporeal partial nephrectomy under pharmaco-cold ischemia for renal cell carcinoma].
AIM  To develop the method for extracorporeal partial nephrectomy under pharmaco-cold ischemia without ureter intersection with orthotopic replantation of renal vessels for RCC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 37 patients with morphologically confirmed RCC pT1a-Т3bN0M0-1G1-3 with intraparenchymal and central location of the tumor in cases of single kidney, comorbidity of contralateral kidney and kidney on the side of lesion.
RESULTS
Mean surgery time was 413.97±89.14 minutes.
Mean time of warm ischemia was 8.39±4.75 minutes, cold ischemia - 151.41±41.29 minutes.
Intraoperative and postoperative complications were detected in 3 (8.1%) and 18 (48.6%) patients respectively.
CONCLUSION
Extracorporeal partial nephrectomy under pharmaco-cold ischemia without ureter intersection with orthotopic replantation of renal vessels for RCC is a relatively safe organ-sparing treatment.  It provides resection of large tumors with any location under prolonged cold ischemia without ureter intersection.
