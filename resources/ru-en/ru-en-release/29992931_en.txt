[The role of Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma].  The research of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway activity was carried out on biopsy specimens of 43 patients with oral hyperplasia, squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma.
Tissue antigens were determined using a mouse monoclonal antibody to Ki-67 protein and rabbit monoclonal antibody to Gli-1 protein.
In squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma specimens Gli-1 was detected in the cytoplasm of cells only.
The correlation was found between the proliferative activity of epithelial cells and Gli-1 distribution.
Protein Gli-1 can be used for early diagnosis of malignant transformation of oral stratified squamous epithelium.
