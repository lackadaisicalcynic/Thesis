[The clinical aspects of occupational sensorineural impairment of hearing of the acoustic origin].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the specific clinical features of occupational sensorineural impairment of hearing (OSNHI) depending on the origin of this pathology, viz. noise, infrasound and/or their combination.
The review of research concerning this problem made it possible to systematize variants of ODNHI based on the clinical signs taking into consideration the influence of these physical factors.  Pathophysiological features of the exposure of the organs of hearing to infrasound are described.
