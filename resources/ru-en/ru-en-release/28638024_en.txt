[Diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder].
AIM  To qualify cognitive impairment in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and evaluate the efficacy of memoplant in the treatment of this pathology.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The authors present the results of the clinical, psychological and electroencephalographic examination of 40 patients with ADHD, aged from 18 to 45 years.  All patients received memoplant in dose of 240 mg a day for 8 weeks.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Adult patients with ADHD were characterized by both subjective and objective disorders of memory and attention.
The results of the electroencephalographic study suggested the dysfunction of the frontal-thalamic regulatory system and the lack of non-specific activation of the reticular formation.
After treatment, clinical improvement was observed in 24 patients (60.0%).
Repeated psychological and neuropsychological examinations showed a reduction of inattention and improvement of memory performance.
