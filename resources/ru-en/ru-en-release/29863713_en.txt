[Clinical pathomorphology and tanatogenesis of various forms of alcoholic intoxication].  The objective of the present study was to identify the clinical and pathomorphological changes in the internal organs for the elucidation of the cause of death associated with various forms of alcoholic intoxication (chronic alcoholic intoxication, poisoning with surrogate alcohols, etc.).
The analysis of the clinical conditions resulting from alcohol abuse has demonstrated that the principal pathology underlying the fatal outcome is complemented by a variety of non-lethal somatic disorders aggravating the patients' condition and enhancing its severity.
The clinicians are known to give more attention to the accompanying somatic complications than to the cause underlying the main pathology (alcoholism).
Such attitude in the absence of the adequate treatment of the alcohol dependency is neither clinically efficient nor economically appropriate.
Poisoning with surrogate alcohols is characterized by the pulmonary-cerebral variant of tanatogenesis in the combination with hypercoagulation and the erosive processes in the gastrointestinal tract whereas death from alcoholic intoxication is usually associated with heart tanatogenesis.
