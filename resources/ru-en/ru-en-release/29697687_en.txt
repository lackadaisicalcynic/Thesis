[Thoracoscopic pulmonary resection for metastatic lesion without pleural drainage: initial experience].  AIM
To analyze the possibility of thoracoscopic pulmonary resection for metastatic lesion without pleural drainage.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 10 patients aged 53.8 years.
Most of patients had solitary lung injury within 3 cm from the visceral pleura on the average.
Surgical treatment was performed in standard fashion: hardware atypical pulmonary resection within healthy tissues.
Pleural cavity was drained with 24 Fr tube.
After that lung was inflated under visual control.  Since wounds were closured residual air was evacuated by active aspiration and drainage tube was removed.
Control chest X-ray was performed in 2 hours and 1 day after surgery.
RESULTS
The technique was successful in all patients.
Mean surgery time was 52 minutes.
There was no blood loss in all patients.
Pneumo- and/or hydrothorax were absent according to control chest X-ray in postoperative period.
Mean length of postoperative hospital-stay was 3 days (median 2 days).
There were no cases of repeated hospitalization.
