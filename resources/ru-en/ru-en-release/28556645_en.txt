[Age features of cytogenetic effects of spring-summer encephalitis among residents of northern western Siberia in connection with polymorphism for genes of glutathione-S-transferase].  The aim of this work was a comparative study of the effects of spring diseases cytogenetic years of tick-borne encephalitis in elderly and young age due to differences in genes of glutathione-S-transferase.
Surveyed by routine cytogenetics 120 patients with tick-borne encephalitis residents North of Tomsk region.  We have taken in the study persons aged 20-35 years (Group 1) and 65-85 years old (Group 2).
Material for study (buccal epithelium) was taken from each subject 3-5 times: 1st-2nd day after hospitalization, in 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months.
Tick-borne encephalitis infection causes a significantly large changes in cytogenetic regimens using buccal epithelium in the elderly than in younger patients.
Restoring cytogenetic norms observed in a group of young in 3 months after hospitalization, in the elderly - in 6 months.
When comparing cytogenetic effects of encephalitis shows: the young patients tick-borne encephalitis level by routine cytogenetics abnormal cells was significantly higher in carriers of inactive forms of gene GSTM1 (0)/GSTT1 (0) than containing active homozygous variants of these genes.
Such patterns have not been noted in a group of elderly patients.
