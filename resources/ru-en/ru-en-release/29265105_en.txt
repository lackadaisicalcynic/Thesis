[Serotonin neurotrasmission and treatment options for depression].
The efficacy of modern antidepressants is largely related to their ability to enhance neurotransmission of serotonin.  The medicines with serotonergic properties include trazodone, which is intermediate between tricyclic antidepressants with their powerful antidepressive effect and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as first-line agents in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.
The value of trazodone for clinical practice is determined by the effective elimination of the symptoms of major depressive disorder in combination with good tolerability, including in elderly patients.  Among the advantages of trazodone is the absence of such undesirable effects as sexual dysfunction and weight gain.
Trazodone has significant hypnotic and anxiolytic properties, which gives it special meaning in the treatment of depression, combined with insomnia and anxiety.  It is emphasized that the beneficial effect of trazodone on sleep should not prevent its main use as a drug for treating major depressive disorder regardless of whether depression is accompanied by insomnia or not.
