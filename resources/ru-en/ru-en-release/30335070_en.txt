[Dose-dependent effects of cortexin in chronic cerebral ischemia (results of a multicenter randomized controlled study)].  AIM
To study an effect of cortexin on neurological symptoms and oxidative stress as part of the ischemic cascade in chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI), I-II stages.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The multicenter randomized controlled study included 189 patients with CCI, 42 (22.2%) men and 147 (77.8%) women, mean age 64.3Â±0.5 years.
Patients were randomized into three groups.  Group 1 received intramuscular injection of 20 mg of cortexin, group 2 received 10 mg of cortexin; group 3 received basic treatment only.
The duration of treatment was 10 days, the treatment course was repeated after 6 months.
The patients were examined at baseline and during treatment (in total 5 times).
Along with clinical and neurological examinations, some scales and tests ('Fedin Outpatient scale of chronic brain ischemia', MFI-20, Spiegel sleep scale, the Zung self-rating depression scale, Spielberger's inventory, the clock-drawing test, the 5-word test) were used.
The severity of oxidation stress was assessed by the content of reduced SH-groups and total superoxide dismutase activity.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A dose-dependent effect of cortexin on the severity of neurological disorders, asthenia, sleep disturbance was shown.  Antidepressant and anxiolytic effects were insignificant and were determined after repeated courses of the drug.
The laboratory data confirmed the antioxidant effect regardless of the dose of cortexin.
The safety and good tolerability of the drug were shown.
