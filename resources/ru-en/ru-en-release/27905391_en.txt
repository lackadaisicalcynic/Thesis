[The stabilometric and clinical characteristics in patients with the consequences of stroke during the complex rehabilitation].  AIM
To perform the complex stabilometric and clinical assessment of movement disorders in post-stroke patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Sixty-three patients in the late recovery period of stroke underwent the complex rehabilitation in the hospital.
RESULTS
Based on the dynamics of statokinesiogram area and shift of the center of pressure, four variants of stabilometric changes with different baseline parameters of patient's motor activity were determined.
CONCLUSION
The stabilometric results reflect the stages of the formation of the persistent pathological static/locomotor stereotype and compensatory mechanisms for the low extremity dysfunction.
