[Modern treatments for degenerative disc diseases of the lumbosacral spine.  A literature review].
Many researchers consider degenerative diseases of the spine as a pandemic of the XXIst century.  Herniated intervertebral discs of the lumbosacral spine occur in 61% of patients with degenerative spine diseases.
Of these, 15% of patients have herniated discs at the LII-LIII level, 10% of patients at the LIII-LIV level, and 40% of patients at the LIV-LV and LV-SI levels.  A high cost of conservative treatment of degenerative spine disease symptoms and its low efficacy in reducing the intensity and duration of pain necessitate the development of new methods of surgical treatment.
In this paper, we analyze the literature data on minimally invasive spine surgery and demonstrate the main advantages of percutaneous endoscopic surgical techniques.
