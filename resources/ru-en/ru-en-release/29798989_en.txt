[The features of opisthorchiasis papillitis diagnosis].
AIM
To develop an optimal diagnostic algorithm in order to the most reliable decrease of inflammatory changes severity in large duodenal papilla in patients with chronic opisthorchiasis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Medical reports of 384 patients with opisthorchiasis-induced cholangitis have been analyzed.  Diagnostic methods were abdominal ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound of terminal common bile duct, CT scans, MRI of abdominal organs including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy of the papilla, ERCP and PTHC.
Comprehensive general and individual analysis of each of them has determined their advantages and disadvantages.
CONCLUSION
Examination should by comprehensive to evaluate visual appearance of large duodenal papilla, lumen dimensions, state of its walls with histological research.
Imaging tests are favorable to determine the diagnosis of papillitis due to possible assessment of lumen dimensions and state of the walls.  While making a choice the priority should be given to endoscopic ultrasound examination.
It allows visual inspection, assessment of the lumen, the walls of papilla and provides biopsy of deep structures.
