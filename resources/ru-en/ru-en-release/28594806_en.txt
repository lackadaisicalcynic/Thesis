[A new method of endoscopic harvesting of the great saphenous vein in an open system].  We examined a total of 246 patients subjected to coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of the great saphenous vein (GSV).
The patients were subdivided into two groups.
Group One (n=121) patients endured procurement of the great saphenous vein by a new endoscopic technique in an open system with the help of the equipment Karl Storz and electric dissector Ligasure.
In Group Two (n=125) patients the vein was harvested by means of the traditional open method.
In all patients we evaluated complications in the early postoperative period 13±2.5 days after the operation.
The rate of relapsing angina pectoris in both Groups turned out to be low and did not differ (1.65% in Group One and 1.6% in Group Two).
Patients of the both groups differed significantly by the incidence of postoperative complications on the lower limbs in the zone of procurement of the GSV (9.09% in Group One and 26.4% in Group Two, p=0.131).
Group Two patients (open method of procurement of the GSV) were considerably more often found to have developed cases of lymphorrhoea, haematomas, disjunction of the sutures (21.6%) compared with Group One (endoscopic method) patients (3.3%) (p=0.167), which in 10.4% of cases required secondary surgical debridement of wounds in patients after the open harvest of the GSV.
Eventually, the length of hospital stay for Group Two patients increased significantly (15 ± 4.5 days) compared with Group One patients (8±1.1 days) (p=0.361). Hence, the endoscopic method of harvesting the GSV in the open CO2 system makes it possible to obtain a good cosmetic effect on the lower limbs after the operation, to considerably decrease the complications rate, thus reducing the length of hospital stay.
