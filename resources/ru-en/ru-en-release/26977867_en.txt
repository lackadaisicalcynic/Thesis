[Endovascular arterial embolization for duodenal bleeding as an alternative to surgical approach].
AIM
To present possibilities of transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) in duodenal bleeding management.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Treatment of 212 patients with acute duodenal bleeding for the period from 2012 to 2014 was analyzed.  In 32 (22.5%) patients of the study group bleeding recurrence or its high risk was indication for TAE.
RESULTS
Change of surgical tactics for bleeding from upper gastrointestinal tract including endoscopic hemostasis optimization, wide introduction of TAE and sharp decrease of surgical activity reduced overall mortality to 1.6% in 2012--2014.
CONCLUSION
TAE is effective to control bleeding and reduces mortality rate especially in high risk and elderly patients.
