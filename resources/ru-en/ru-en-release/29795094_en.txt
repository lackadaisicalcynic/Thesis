[Chronic sacral nerve electrostimulation in treatment of neurogenic pelvic organ dysfunction in children].  Myelodysplasia is the most common cause of congenital pelvic abnormalities in children.
The causes of acquired neurogenic pelvic dysfunctions in children include spinal cord injury, myelitis, and neurodegenerative diseases.  Urination impairments in children with neurological disorders are a serious clinical problem.
In most cases, the capabilities of conservative treatment of pelvic organ dysfunctions are limited.  One of the most promising directions in treatment of neurogenic urination disorders is modeling of a lost urination mechanism using direct or mediated electrostimulation of the nerve fibers of the sacral plexus - neuromodulation.
AIM
the review aim is to describe the technique and results of chronic sacral neurostimulation in treatment of pelvic organ disorders in children, which have been reported in the international literature.
An obligatory condition for application of chronic sacral neurostimulation (CSNS) is a positive clinical response to test electrostimulation of the S3 nerve root.  The test period duration is 1-3 weeks.
In the case of a positive effect, a permanent system is implanted for neurostimulation of the S3 nerve root.  On treatment with CSNS, children with severe urinary incontinence had a significant decrease in the rate of incontinence episodes, and patients with urinary retention had no or reduced need for periodic catheterization.
Therefore, the accumulated experience of using CSNS in children with spinal cord diseases indicates the need in further study of the technique capabilities for correction of pelvic organ dysfunctions.
