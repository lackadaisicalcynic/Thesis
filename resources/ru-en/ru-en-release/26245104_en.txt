[Optimization of the conditions for the detection of psychoactive compounds of the cholinoblocker and antidepressant groups with the use of the microcolumn HPLC technique].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the possibility of using the BD-2003 database to separate the mixtures of various antidepressants by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based on the MiLiChrome A-02 complex with an EcoNova UV detector.
The parameters of identification are described.  The possibility of modification of the standard conditions for the analysis is demonstrated as exemplified by the identification of certain cholinoblockers.
The proposed approach to the separation of psychoactive preparations provides a basis for the development of methods for the determination of these substances in biological tissues and fluids.
