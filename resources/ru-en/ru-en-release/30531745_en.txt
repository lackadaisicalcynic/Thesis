[Inflammatory markers in diagnosis and prognosis of abdominal sepsis].  For today, it is necessary to recognize, that treatment of patients with abdominal sepsis remains the basic problem in urgent surgery due to the invariably high mortality.
Early diagnostics and targeted therapy are the key points for improving of sepsis outcome.
At present, researchers around the world have proposed a large number of biological markers for diagnosing sepsis and predicting mortality.  Ideally, doctors can use biomarkers for risk stratification, diagnosing, monitoring of treatment effectiveness and outcome prediction.
The biomarker is a laboratory parameter that can be objectively measured and characterized as an indicator of normal and pathological biological processes.
The article presents the modern concept of the sepsis pathogenesis for understanding the role of various biomarkers and inflammatory indicators in its development.
We have analyzed literature data and summarized information on the possible use of biological markers and their combinations in the early detection of sepsis, for monitoring sepsis and predicting its outcome.
