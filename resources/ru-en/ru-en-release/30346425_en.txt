[Influence of distal misalignment of the mandible on the development of postural pathology].  The aim of this study was to study the relationship between the distal displacement of the mandible in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) with postural pathology.
We examined 20 people from the control group (age 18-25 years) and 70 patients of the same age with temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJD) complicated by dentoalveolar anomalies (distal bite - 27 persons, orthognathic with anomalies of the position of individual teeth - 18, deep - 16, mesial - 4, straight - 2, open - 2, cross - 1), before and after treatment with occlusive tires.
Cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) of the TMJ and photometric analysis were made to all those examined.
The CBCT analysis was carried out according to the method developed by us, photometric analysis - with the help of the computer program developed by us.
Thus, as a result of the study in patients with TMJD complicated by dentoalveolar anomalies were detected significant displacement of the mandible backwards and upwards, as well as according to the photometric analysis of the presence of postural disorders both in the frontal plane (the change of the head position relative to the shoulders and horizontally, impaired facial configuration in the form of an asymmetry of the arrangement of the lines of the eyes, the corners of the mouth and shoulders) and in the sagittal (the forward displacement of the head and the inclination of the vertical axis of the body forward).
Treatment of patients with occlusive tires allowed to normalize the position of the lower jaw and posture.
