[Five-year outcomes of aorto-femoral vascular reconstructions in patients with multifocal atherosclerosis].
AIM
To analyze long-term results of surgical treatment of atherosclerotic occlusive-stenotic lesion of aorto-femoral segment within the single-center prospective register.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 275 patients who underwent aorto-femoral reconstructive interventions for the period 2011-2014.  Inclusion criterion was indications for aorto-femoral surgery due to severe atherosclerotic lesions of the infrarenal aorta and/or ilio-femoral arteries.
Mean follow-up was 54Â±11.6 months.
RESULTS
Prognostic significance of various clinical-instrumental, anatomical-angiographic and perioperative variables has been comprehensively analyzed.  Five-year outcomes and cardiovascular morbidity were assessed in consecutive patients after reconstructive procedures on the aorto-femoral segment.
Multidisciplinary approach to determine optimal revascularization strategy and certain tactical and technical algorithms are necessary to improve the outcomes in these severe patients.
