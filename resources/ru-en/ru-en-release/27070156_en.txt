[Diagnostic value of the stimulating growth factor ST2 during hospitalization for myocardial infarction].
AIM  To determine the concentration of the stimulating growth factor ST2 and its relationship to the clinical course of myocardial infarction (MI) over time during hospitalization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eighty-eight MI patients whose mean age was 59Â±8.36 years were examined.
On days 1 and 12 of MI, the serum levels of ST2 and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were determined by ELISA.
A control group consisted of 30 people.
RESULTS
On day 1 of hospitalization for MI, the concentrations of ST2 and NT-proBNP were higher 2.4 and 4.5 times, respectively, than those in the controls; by day 12, there was a statistically significant decrease in the level of ST2 while that of NT-proBNP was unchanged.
During hospitalization, the investigators recorded MI complications, according to which the patients were divided into favorable and unfavorable MI groups.
On day 1 of hospitalization, the level of ST2 in the patients with unfavorable MI was twice higher than in those with favorable MI and 3.7 times higher than in the control group.
On day 12, both favorable and unfavorable MI groups showed a reduction in the level of the marker.
On day 1 of MI, the concentration of NT-proBNP in the patients with a poor prognosis was 6.8 times greater than in the controls and 1.8 times more than in the patients with a good prognosis.
On day 12, NT-proBNP levels remained elevated in both groups.
Logistic regression analysis revealed that the determination of ST2 in combination with NT-proBNP increased their diagnostic significance (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.7-3.2; area under characteristic curve, 0.89; p=0.004).
CONCLUSION
The level of ST2 was a more sensitive indicator of hospitalization for MI than that of NT-proBNP.
The combined use of ST2 and NT-proBNP was found to have a high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
