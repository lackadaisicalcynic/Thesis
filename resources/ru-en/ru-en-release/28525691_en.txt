[Features aggregation erythrocytes and platelets in old rats experiencing regular exercise on a treadmill].
We estimated the age dynamics of aggregation properties of platelets and red blood cells in aged rats on the background of regular muscle loads.
The study was performed on 26 male rats of 12 months of age, experience during the year, daily exercise.
Control is represented by 91 healthy male rats: 30 individuals (12 months), 32 rats (18 months) and 29 rats (24 months).
Applied biochemistry, hematology and statistical methods.  The gradual increase in control observed with age, and the erythrocyte aggregation properties of platelets.
In experimental animals observed retention of activity aggregation of platelets and red blood cells at a level close to the end during the whole period of regular muscle loads.
