[The influence of the technique for the post-isometric relaxation of the muscles of the lumbosacral region of the spine on the manifestations of the flexion contracture in the hip joint in the men at the age of 50-60 years following amputation of the lower limb at the hip level in the course of the rehabilitation process].  AIM
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the outcome the application of the technique for the post-isometric relaxation of the muscles of the lumbosacral region of the spine and of the lumbosacral junction as a component of the combined rehabilitation on the manifestations of the flexion contracture in the hip joint in the men at the age of 50-60 years following amputation of the lower limb at the hip level throughout the course of the rehabilitative process.
MATERIALS AND METHODS  A total of 243 patients who had undergone ablation of a femur available for the examination. 153 of them were treatment with the use of the technique for the post-isometric relaxation of the muscles of the lumbosacral region of the spine and of the lumbosacral junction.
The control group was comprised of the remaining 90 patients treated without the application of the technique for post-isometric relaxation.  The analysis of the degree of flexion contracture of the hip joint on the side of ablation was carried out by means of the Thomas test.
RESULTS
The results of the study give evidence that that use of the technique for the post-isometric relaxation of muscles of the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joint makes it possible to reduce the time needed to decrease the severity of contracture of the hip joint during the rehabilitation process.
CONCLUSION
The data obtained provide a basis for recommending the inclusion of the technique for the post-isometric relaxation of muscles of the lumbar spine and the lumbosacral junction into the program of the combined rehabilitation of the patients who had undergone ablation of a femur.
