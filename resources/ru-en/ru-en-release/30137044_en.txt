[Endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke].  Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability in the population of developed countries.
Revascularization of the affected cerebral territory improves the prognosis and reduces mortality, which has been proven by randomized studies using systemic thrombolysis protocols.
Over the last ten years, endovascular mechanical thrombus extraction using stent retrievers and/or aspiration neurointerventional catheters has been introduced into the clinical treatment of ischemic stroke, and after reporting the results of randomized studies on this topic, the technique has become ubiquitous.
This work objective was to systematize the results of key studies on the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in chronological order, including the latest data of 2018.
