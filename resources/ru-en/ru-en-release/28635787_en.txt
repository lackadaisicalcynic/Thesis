AIM  To assess the relationship of the lipid spectrum, smoking, coffee drinking and brachiocephalic artery intima-media thickness with clinical characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 46 patients with PD, I-IV stages according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale, and 30 people without extrapyramidal pathology or cardiovascular diseases (controls).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Patients with PD had lower levels of triglycerides and lower intima-media complex thickness compared to the controls.  There was a trend towards the lower levels of total blood cholesterol, the differences were most marked in the late stage of PD.
It can be suggested that the factors studied do not play a significant role in the development of degenerative process in PD.  The marked differences may be related to a possible influence of antiparkinsonian treatment on the indicators of lipid metabolism.
