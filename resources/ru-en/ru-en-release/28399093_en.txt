[The differential diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in climacteric transition].
AIM  To study clinical symptoms of menopause depression, develop differential diagnostic criteria and consider treatment aspects.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and fifty women, aged 41-65 years, with mental disorders developed in different periods of menopause (perimenopause, menopause and post menopause) were studied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Four types of depression were diagnosed: climacteric (n=46), psychogenic (n=35), endogenic (n=42) and involutional (n=27).
Clinical characteristics of each type are presented in the aspect of correlations between psychopathological and climacteric (somatic) symptoms.
Therapy of the depressions is discussed in light of literature on psychopharmacological, hormonal treatment and psychotherapy.
The efficacy of antidepressants, in particular valdoxan (agomelatine), is highlighted.
