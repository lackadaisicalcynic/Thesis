[Transcription factor p53 and skin aging].  The review is devoted to an actual problem of cosmetics in gerontology, one of molecular aspects of skin aging.
Cell renewal processes slow down with aging, and the proliferation apoptosis ratio shifts towards cell death.  One of the most pivotal apoptotic markers is the transcription factor p53. p53 protein expression in the skin keratinocytes increases under the influence of ultraviolet radiation.
Wherein when exposed to ultraviolet radiation mutant forms of p53 have been revealed in 70 % of keratinocytes.  On the one hand, suppression of p53 expression decreases apoptosis in skin cells that slows down the process of aging.
On the other hand, it promotes the development of tumors in the skin.
Thus, maintaining the physiological balance of p53 expression in skin cells is important for the basic and practical cosmetic medicine in gerontology.  In addition, p53 protein may be used as a functionality marker of skin cells when administered with geroprotective cosmetic means and instrumental cosmetology methods.
