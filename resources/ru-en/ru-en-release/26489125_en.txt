Results of CAM therapy in amblyopic patients.  AIM
to evaluate changes in visual acuity and compliance after CAM therapy in patients that initially failed to respond to occlusion or were non-compliant.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Twenty nine patients aged 4-10 years that failed to improve under occlusion therapy were included in this prospective study.  Patients were divided into two groups according to the age (16 patients of 4-7 years of age and 13 patients of 8-10 years of age) and two other groups according to the type of amblyopia (15 anisometropic and 14 strabismic cases).
CAM stimulation was prescribed to all patients for six days.  Occlusion therapy was then recommenced.
Best corrected visual acuity was measured before the CAM course, immediately after, at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, and on the last visit.
RESULTS
Visual acuities in all study groups increased significantly immediately after the CAM therapy with further improvement during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION
CAM therapy for amblyopia is helpful in improving visual acuity as well as patients' compliance to subsequent occlusion therapy.
