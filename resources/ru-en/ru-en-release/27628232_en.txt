[Role of correction of the syndrome of intestinal failure and abdominal hypertension in the prevention of infection of pancreatic necrosis].  UNLABELLED
The number of patients with acute pancreatitis and pancreatic necrosis has been steadily increasing.  Mortality in infected pancreatic necrosis remains high.
AIM  To develop measures to prevent infection of pancreatic necrosis by timely correction of intra-abdominal hypertension and the syndrome of intestinal failure.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Developed a package of measures, consisting of early intestinal lavage and enterosorption, intravenous highdoses of octreotide, epidural blockade, adequate detox and the start of effective antimicrobial therapy.
Comparative evaluation of clinical, laboratory and instrumental data in the primary (n=50) and control (n=50) groups.
RESULTS
In the main group pancreatogenic sepsis occurred in 10%, control 18%.
Mortality, respectively, was 8 and 16%.
