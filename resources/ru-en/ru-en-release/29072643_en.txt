[Correlation of functional state of dental system and emotional stress in young adults].  The aim of the study was to evaluate correlation of dental system functional status and emotional stress level in young adults.
The study involved 164 patients aged 20-25 years.  TMJ dysfunction was diagnosed according to M. Ahlers and H. Jakstat criteria (2000).
All patients underwent electromyography (EMG) of mastication muscles at rest and by functional test.
Emotional stress and anxiety were assessed by Holmes and Rahe stress scale, Jakhin-Mendeleevich clinical questionnaire and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.  The study revealed correlation between EMG activity of masticatory muscles and emotional stress level highlighting the importance of stress assessment in TMJ dysfunction planning.
