[Reconstructive otoplasty: differentiated approach to rib cartilage processing and ear framework formation using carving technique].  The aim of the research was to optimize surgical rehabilitation of patients with auricle defects and deformities by the developing of differentiated approach to the choice of reconstructive otoplasty method.
The study involved 30 patients with auricle defects and deformities of congenital (20 patients) and acquired (10 patients) etiology.  The defects were total in 25 patients and partial in 5 patients.
Preoperative planning was based in Doppler ultrasound of temporal region vessels, laser Doppler flowmetry, temporal skin ultrasound and 3D ribcage CT.  The surgical tactic was selected according to the possibility of mastoid region skin usage or necessity of the temporoparietal fascial flap.
The approach proved to be highly efficient as otoplasty outcomes were good in 80% of cases, satisfactory in 10% and unsatisfactory in 10%.
