The evaluation of cognitive skills and the quality of life between Parkinson Disease patients and healthy aged people above 60 years old.  In the 21st century mankind has made a huge progress in the health care system, so the average life expectancy has increased significantly compared to the previous centuries.
The managing of healthy ageing of the population represents one of the main actual problems of the national health care systems around the world as the aged population is increasing, so, for instance, it is estimated that there will be over 2 billion people worldwide over the age of 65 by the year 2050 [36].
In particular, the age-related neurological diseases such as Parkinson Disease (PD) have seen a dramatic increase in international prevalence.
Projections suggest that the neurodegenerative diseases like PD will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040 [36]; thus presenting an ever-growing challenge to maintain an optimal quality of life of the patients.  In healthy ageing, cognitive skills impair naturally due to natural brain atrophy; in PD these processes are rather accelerated, so that, overwhelming clinical studies showed that dementia eventually develops in up to 80-85 % of patients with PD [1, 39].
This article is focuses on evaluating the health related quality of life measurements of PD patients such as cognitive status, anxiety and stress levels as well as it aims to suggest a possible future strategy to improve the quality of life of the patients.
