[Intersphincteric resection for stage I-III low rectal cancer is an oncologically safe alternative to extralevator abdomino-perineal rectal resection].  AIM
To compare oncologic efficiency of intersphincteric resections and extralevator abdominoperineal excisions in surgical treatment of low rectal cancer.  METHODS
Between 2006 and 2015 in Department of colorectal and pelvic floor surgery (Russian scientific center of surgery n.a. acad. B.V. Petrovsky) and in Clinic of Colorectal and Minimally invasive surgery (Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University) 40 consecutive patients underwent intersphincteric resection (ISR) and 31 underwent extralevator abdominoperineal excision (EAPE).  All patients had low rectal cancer staged I-III within 5 cm from the anal verge.
RESULTS
Circular resection margin >1 mm was achieved in 95% and 84% of patients after ISR and EAPR correspondingly (p=0.002), negative distal resection margin was achieved in 95% of ISR patients.
In ISR group mean distance from the lower tumor edge to the distal resection margin was 1,17Â±0,78 cm.
Colo-anal anastomosis leak rate was 17%.
The 3-year disease-free survival in ISR group was 97%, 5-year disease-free survival was 93%.
The 5-year disease-free survival in stage III for ISR group was 71,4%.
In 98% of ISR patients complete restoration of bowel continuity was performed.
