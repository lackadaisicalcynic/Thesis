[Out-patient dental care in patients with arterial hypertension].  The aim of the study was to improve dental treatment quality in patients with arterial hypertension.
The study included 256 patients with arterial hypertension (153 females, 103 males) aged 35 to 60 years.
Anesthesia efficacy was assessed by visual analog scale after treatment.
Oral adverse effects caused by regular intake of antihypertensive drugs and interrelation with articaine and mepivacaine were described.
The study proved high efficacy of 4% articaine 1:200 000.
The efficacy of 3% mepivacaine with no vasoconstriction agents was 86.4±2.3% but may be enhanced to 93.3±2.3% by preventive non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents taken 25-30 minutes before treatment in maximal daily dosage.
