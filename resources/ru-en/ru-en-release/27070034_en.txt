[The age-specific features of palm dermatoglyphics in the adults subjects].  This article was designed to consider the congenital age-specific features of palm dermatoglyphics in the adults subjects (including the type of the papillary patterns, axial tri-radii, the termini of palmar main lines, the rudiments of palmar lines, the dermatoglyphic ridge count between the stable anatomical structures).
The objective of the study was to look for the new diagnostic markers of the biological age.
It included the identification of the palm prints obtained from 180 Caucasoid men and 120 women at the age varying from 16 to 80 years.
The results of the mathematical and statistical analysis provided the basis for drawing up the list of 18 attributes of palm dermatoglyphics significantly (p<0.05) differing in the frequency of occurrence between the representatives of individual age groups.
The methods are proposed allowing to use these findings for the expert evaluation of the age of unknown subjects.
