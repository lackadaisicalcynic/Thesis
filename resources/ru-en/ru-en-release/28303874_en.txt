[Radical oncological stomach, liver and pancreatic surgery in patients over 80 years old].  AIM
To analyze the results of radical surgery for upper GI cancer in patients ≥80 years old.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period November 2010 - June 2015 there were 14 radical operations in elderly (≥80 years) patients with gastric, liver and pancreatic tumors.
There were 4 Whipple procedures, 4 total and 2 distal gastrectomies, 1 total pancreatectomy as well as a central liver resection, one laparoscopic 5 segment resection and one 2, 3, 7 segment resection.
We analyzed blood loss, duration of surgery, 90-day mortality, morbidity (Dindo-Clavien scoring), length of hospital-stay.
RESULTS
Blood loss ranged from 0 to 1500 ml, mean duration of surgery - from 150 to 560 min. There was one case of in-hospital mortality: one patient after a Whipple procedure died in 17 days after surgery due to massive arrosive bleeding.
Complications developed in 8 patients, 3 of them required reoperation.
Mean hospital-stay was 15±6 (8-29) days.
CONCLUSION
Advanced upper GI surgery for cancer is feasible in octagenarians and does not lead to inappropriate mortality and morbidity.
Comprehensive preoperative examination alongside with enhanced recovery protocol are prerequisites for this type of surgery.
