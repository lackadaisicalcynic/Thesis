[Orbitozygomatic approaches to skull base tumors spreading into the orbit, paranasal sinuses, nasal cavity, and pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossae].  The paper analyzes application of orbitozygomatic approaches at the Department of Skull Base and Craniofacial Surgery of the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute for a 14-year period.
During this time, 723 patients were operated on using the orbitozygomatic approach, which has become the workhorse of surgery for skull base tumors spreading into the orbit, paranasal sinuses, and pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossae.  The authors describe seven major modifications of the orbitozygomatic approach that they have used in their practice.
