[The prevalence of the palmo-mental reflex in patients with cervicocranialgia].
AIM  To study characteristics of the palmo-mental reflex (PMR) in patients with cervicalgia accompanied by the most common forms of headaches: migraine, tension-type headache (TTH) and cervicogenic headache (CGH).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Prevalence of PMR was studied in a sample of 142 patients with neck pain (mean age 39.1±12.1 years; 103 women and 39 men) accompanied by migraine, TTH or CGH.
The first group included 66 patients (51 women and 15 men; mean age 39.4±12.8 years) with neck pain accompanied predominantly by migraine.  The second group included 76 patients (52 women and 24 men; mean age 38.9±11.7 years) with TTH and/or CGH.
RESULTS
The palmo-mental reflex was observed in 86.4% patients of the 1-st group and 7.0% of the second group (χ2=91.41; p=0.000).  CONCLUSION
The results suggest the presence of anatomical and pathophysiological premises for occurrence of this reflex in patients with neck pain accompanied by migraine.
