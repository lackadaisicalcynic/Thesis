OBJECTIVE  Based on the results of 5-year follow-up study, to describe the dynamics of psychopathological symptoms in young patients with non-psychotic forms of mental diseases met the criteria of ultra-high risk for schizophrenia who received preventive psychopharmacotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 32 young men, aged 16--25 years, presented with the symptoms of ultra-high risk of schizophrenia during the first hospitalization in 2009--2011.
Follow-up was carried out in 2014--2015 (mean follow-up 5.79Â±0.36 years).
According to ICD-10, patients were stratified into 3 groups: mood disorders, personality disorders and schizotypal disorders.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
According to the characteristics of subsequent development of these disorders, four types were singled out: mechanisms of the development of acute sensitive delusions (I), interpretative delusions (II), catatonic disorganization (III) and cognitive disorders pathognomonic for schizophrenia spectrum disorders (IV).
Correlations between these types and nosologic disorders and their different reversibility under treatment were found.
These types can be considered as predictors of outcome over the follow-up period.
