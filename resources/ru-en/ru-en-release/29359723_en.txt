[A strategy for increasing the efficiency of psychopharmacological treatment of hyperkinetic behavior disorder with pantogam].
AIM  To assess short-term efficiency of hopantenic acid (pantogam) in the treatment of children with hyperkinetic behavior disorder, in whom the previous treatment with atomoxetine was not efficient.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Twenty-four children (16 boys and 8 girls), aged 6-11 years, diagnosed with hyperkinetic behavior disorder (ICD-10 item F90.1) were enrolled in this open non-randomized study.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A short-term positive therapeutic dynamics was observed when introducing hopantenic acid (pantogam) augmentation strategy to existing atomoxetine therapy.  Qualitative improvements in children's state were found not only in the ability to control symptoms but also in their social functioning levels and quality of life.
The proposed therapeutic strategy can help to improve treatment outcomes for children with certain clinical forms of hyperkinetic behavior disorder.
