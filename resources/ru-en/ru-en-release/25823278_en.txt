[Renal dysfunction in patients with myocardial infarction concurrent with type 2 diabetes mellitus].  Carbohydrate metabolic disturbances are an independent risk factor for not only the development, but also poor course of cardiovascular diseases, particularly those concurrent with renal dysfunction (RD).
This factor acquires particular relevance due to the fact that the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus significantly continues to rise worldwide.
The review considers the main mechanisms and common components of the pathogenesis of RD, as well as the constituents forming its basis in the presence of carbohydrate metabolic disturbances.
Moreover, it highlights the timely detection of RD, a search for new biomarkers of prognostic value for cardiovascular events, and the early diagnosis of RD.
The review unveils the present view of optimal diagnostic and management tactics for patients with myocardial infarction concurrent with background diseases.
