[Violation of cerebral hemodynamics in the cardiac dysfunction caused by chronic heart failure].  UNLABELLED
OBJECTEVE: To study changes of cerebral haemo dynamics at the progressing kardialny dysfunction caused by chronic heart failure.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors executed all researches on male Wistar rats.  Used methods: echocardiography and ultrasound Doppler study of the brain vessels is performed using US-apparatus Mindray M5, using linear sensor 10 MHz (Mindray, China); magnetic resonance imaging of brain and heart of experimental animals with chronic heart failure.
Applied functional tests.
RESULTS  In the early stage of cardiac decompensation does not change the blood flow in the carotid and basilar arteries, but seizure readiness (SR) of the animals increased.
Preservation of reactivity to hypercapnic and compression tests, suggests that the increase in SR is not associated with circulatory disorders in the brain.
Exacerbation of heart failure (HF) leads to severe decompensation, including a decrease in blood flow in the carotid and basilar arteries.
Metabolic cascade of autoregulation in these animals areaktiven and myogenic greatly reduced.  In this case revealed a progressive increase in the SR.
CONCLUSION
Inefficiency of the heart at different stages of HF is not the same effect on the reserves of the autoregulation of cerebral hemodynamics, which affects the formation and aggravation of SR.
Moreover, its rise in various stages of decompensation is not always caused by cerebral ischemia.
