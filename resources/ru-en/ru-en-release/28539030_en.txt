[Comparative organometric characteristic of cerebellum of the young and old age].  The science work is based on morphological research of cerebellums of 219 corpses of people (108 man and 111 woman) of young and old age.
There were used such research methods as organometric, histological and morphometric.
During study a comparative analysis of the mass, linear dimensions, thickness of cerebellar cortex of young and old age was conducted.
The regularities of age variability of organometric characteristic of cerebellum were revealed and they are found in the reduction of mass and linear dimensions of the people of senile age in comparison with younger people.
It was determined that thickness of molecular and granular layers of cerebellum was characterized by aging changing parameters.  The results of the morphological study can serve as a basis for the identification of certain regularities of age anatomy of the cerebellum and have practical significance as indicators of the norm that allows using these data in diagnostic and therapeutic work.
