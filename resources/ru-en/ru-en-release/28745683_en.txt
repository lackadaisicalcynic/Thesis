[Genetic aspects of schizophrenia].  Schizophrenia is a disease with a complex non-Mendelian inheritance mechanism in most cases involving the combined action of a large number of genes.
Identifying of genomic variations associated with schizophrenia endophenotypes has a great potential.
This review describes genetic markers of the disease, current methods of their analysis, including genome-wide association study (GWAS).
Certain genes with mutations that increase the risk of schizophrenia are described.
Functional polymorphisms with phenotypic expression, which are significantly associated with clinical manifestation of schizophrenia, can serve as useful genetic markers.
The authors highlight that currently there are no certain susceptibility genes.
Further global research and search for markers in different population groups are needed.
