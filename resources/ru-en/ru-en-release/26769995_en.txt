Schistosomiasis in school-age children in Burkina Faso after a decade of preventive chemotherapy.
OBJECTIVE  To assess the impact of a decade of biennial mass administration of praziquantel on schistosomiasis in school-age children in Burkina Faso.
METHODS
In 2013, in a national assessment based on 22 sentinel sites, 3514 school children aged 7-11 years were checked for Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni infection by the examination of urine and stool samples, respectively.
We analysed the observed prevalence and intensity of infections and compared these with the relevant results of earlier surveys in Burkina Faso.
FINDINGS
S. haematobium was detected in 287/3514 school children (adjusted prevalence: 8.76%, range across sentinel sites: 0.0-56.3%; median: 2.5%).
The prevalence of S. haematobium infection was higher in the children from the Centre-Est, Est and Sahel regions than in those from Burkina Faso's other eight regions with sentinel sites (P < 0.001).
The adjusted arithmetic mean intensity of S. haematobium infection, among all children, was 6.0 eggs per 10 ml urine.
Less than 1% of the children in six regions had heavy S. haematobium infections - i.e. at least 50 eggs per 10 ml urine - but such infections were detected in 8.75% (28/320) and 11.56% (37/320) of the children from the Centre-Est and Sahel regions, respectively.
Schistosoma mansoni was only detected in two regions and 43 children - i.e. 1 (0.31%) of the 320 from Centre-Sud and 42 (8.75%) of the 480 from Hauts Bassins.
CONCLUSION
By mass use of preventive chemotherapy, Burkina Faso may have eliminated schistosomiasis as a public health problem in eight regions and controlled schistosome-related morbidity in another three regions.
