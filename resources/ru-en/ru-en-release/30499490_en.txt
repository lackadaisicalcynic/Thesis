[Variantsand types of clinical course of different forms of early neurosyphilis in patients with HIV infection].
AIM  To study and compare the frequency and types of clinical course of different forms of early neurosyphilis (NS) in patients with HIV infection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of clinical, laboratory and neuropsychological examinations of two groups of patients: with early NS in combination with HIV infection (n=62) and with early NS without HIV (n=62) were analyzed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The variants (regressive, stationary, slowly progressive, rapidly progressive) and types (favorable, unfavorable) of clinical course of different forms of early NS were identified in these groups.
In the group of HIV-positive patients, an unfavorable course of early NS was observed in 75.8% of patients, with stationary and slowly progressive course being most frequent.
Patients with early NS without HIV infection had a favorable course of the disease in 95.2% of cases.
