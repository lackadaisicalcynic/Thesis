[Surgical treatment of a patient with coronary artery disease combined with stenosis of the left subclavian artery].  Presented in the article is a clinical case report regarding successfully used hybrid technology in combined lesions of the coronary arteries and the first segment of the left subclavian artery.
The patient was subjected to simultaneous hybrid operation, i. e., transaortic angioplasty with stenting of the left subclavian artery by means of the Assurant stent accompanied by coronary artery bypass grafting.
The early postoperative period turned out uneventful.
The patient was discharged with no complications and in a satisfactory condition.
At the 12-month follow-up visit, the patient presented no complaints, felling satisfactory as he stated, and there was no evidence of restenosis as revealed by the findings of ultrasonographic examination.
This clinical case report demonstrates that in this type of combined lesion the use of hybrid technologies makes it possible to obtain a favourable surgical outcome both in the immediate and remote postoperative periods.
