[Role of twin reversed arterial perfusion syndrome in the development of fetus acardius].  Monochorionic multiple pregnancy has a higher risk for obstetric complications, including those due to the development of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and reversed arterial perfusion syndrome (TRAP sequence).
The latter occurs in 0.1% of all monochorionic pregnancies.
The basis for TRAP sequence is a relationship between arterial and venous anastomoses from the appropriate placental areas, causing a recipient fetus to develop at the expense of a donor fetus.
The presence of abnormal anastomoses is considered to be a main cause of acardia.
The prognosis for a donor fetus is also unfavorable: the mortality rates in the absence of intrauterine correction are as high as 55%.
