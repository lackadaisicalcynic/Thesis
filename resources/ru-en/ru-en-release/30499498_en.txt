[Disc hernia regression as a natural course of discogenic lumbosacral radiculopathy].  Disc herniation with radiculopathy is a common cause of severe back pain leading to significant disability and a decrease in patients' quality of life.
The authors report a case of 38-year-old female patient with radiculopathy of the first sacral root due to a large (11 mm) sequestered disc herniation between the fifth lumbar and the first sacral vertebrae.
Conservative treatment with fluoroscopically-guided epidural steroid injection provided a significant clinical improvement, the patient was able to return to normal daily and professional activity in a short time.
MRI in 9 months showed the regression of disc herniation.  Possible predictors and timing of disc herniation regression are discussed, as well as the proposed mechanisms, the main one of which is considered to be immune-mediated lysis.
