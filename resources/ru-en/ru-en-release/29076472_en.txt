[A rare case of diencephalic cachexia in an adult female with cranio-pharyngioma].
Diencephalic cachexia (DС) is progressive weight loss despite a normal caloric intake and a satisfactory state of health, which is caused by hypothalamic lesions.
This is a rare (about 100 cases were reported) and potentially fatal disorder of unknown pathogenesis.
At present, there is no effective pharmacological therapy for the disorder.  Cachexia may regress only if the tumor reduces in size, therefore the timely diagnosis and treatment are of vital importance for the patient.
DС is typical of early childhood, and only a few cases have been reported in adults.
We present a rare case of DС in a 24-year-old female with papillary craniopharyngioma.
