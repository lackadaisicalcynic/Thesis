[Efficacy of video-assisted procedures in advanced age patients with colorectal cancer].  AIM
To assess advisability of video-assisted surgery in advanced age patients with colorectal cancer.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 44 patients with large intestine tumors.  There were 30 patients with colon cancer aged 78.0±1.1 years and 14 patients with rectal neoplasms aged 75.0±1.8 years.
All of them underwent elective video-assisted resections without conversion of the approach.
RESULTS
Good and satisfactory results were achieved in 95.5% of patients.  Postoperative complications occurred in 5 (11.4%) cases followed by redo surgery in 2 (4.5%) patients.
Mortality was absent.  CONCLUSION
Video-assisted procedures are preferable in elective surgery of colorectal cancer in advanced age patients regardless stage and localization of the process.
