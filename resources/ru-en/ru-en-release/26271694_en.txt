[Dynamics of osteogenesis after inoculation of autogenic mesenchymal stem cells of adipose tissue].  Experiment was conducted on 40 rats of Wister line.
On the artificially reproduced experimental model autogenic mesenchimal stem cells (MSC) of adipose tissue were inoculated in space between bone autograph of tibia and mandible.  MSC wasnot inoculated in the comparison group.
Formation of a new bone substance in space between an autograph and mandible bone was observed.  It was clear that after 120 days (180 days), there was a statistically significant decline of the area occupied by an immature fibroreticular bone.
Described phenomenon, presumably, could be explained as a result of decline of the number of active cells in the population of inoculated MSC according to phenomenon of limited number divisions of cells on telomeres, described by Hayflick L. and Moorhead P.S.
