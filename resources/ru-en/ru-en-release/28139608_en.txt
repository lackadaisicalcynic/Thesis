[Standartization of MRI studies in multiple sclerosis].  The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with multiple sclerosis has markedly increased in recent years.
The main task of the MRI studies after the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is to assess the dynamics of MRI for determining disease progression and monitoring the efficacy of therapy.
In this regard, it is very important to obtain the most identical baseline and follow-up MRI that is possible when a single standard protocol is used.
This article presents the protocol of brain MRI and spinal cord MRI and interpretation of MRI studies in patients with multiple sclerosis.
