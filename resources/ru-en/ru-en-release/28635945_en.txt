[Neuroprotective and nephroprotective effects of remote postconditioning: Prospects for clinical use].
The results of experimental and clinical studies strongly suggest that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIP) has no neuroprotective effect during cardiac surgery performed under extracorporeal circulation.
Remote preconditioning (RP) has no neuroprotective effect in hemorrhagic stroke.
A randomized multicenter study is needed to evaluate the efficiency RIP in patients with ischemic stroke.
RP reduces the severity of ischemia/reperfusion kidney injury during transplantation.  RIP has been established to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy.
There is a need for a multicenter trial to evaluate the efficiency of RIP in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  Analysis of the presented data indicates that RIP fails to prevent cardiorenal syndrome in infants and children during cardiac surgery.
The data available in the literature on the capacity of RIP to provide nephroprotective effect in patients after coronary artery bypass surgery are discordant and indicative of the advisability of a multicenter study.
