[Cognitive disorders in patients with schizophrenia at different stages of the disease].
OBJECTIVE
To study cognitive disorders in patients with schizophrenia at different stages of the disease.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty-five patients with paranoid schizophrenia with first and recurrent episodes were examined clinically and psychometrically using the PANSS.  Neurocognitive functioning was assessed with the «Rey--Osterrieth Complex figure».
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Differences were found not only between patients with chronic and first-episode schizophrenia, but also between first-time hospitalized and re-hospitalized patients within the first-episode group.
