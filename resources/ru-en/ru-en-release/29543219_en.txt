[MR tractography in diagnosis and choice of a neurosurgical approach to basal ganglia tumors].
We describe two cases of surgical treatment of well-circumscribed basal ganglia tumors.  The choice of a neurosurgical approach to a deep tumor was based on the MR tractography data and depended on the course and dislocation extent of the corticospinal tract.
MR tractography provides information on the course and dislocation or destruction extent of the corticospinal tract running in the internal capsule and brainstem and clarifies the exact location of a tumor within the basal ganglia.
This information promotes the choice of an optimal approach for radical resection of well-circumscribed tumor, leading to improvement in neurological symptoms and patient's quality of life.
