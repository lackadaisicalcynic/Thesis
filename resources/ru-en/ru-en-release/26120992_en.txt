[Tactics of antihypertensive therapy in patients with hypertonic crisis complicated with hemorrhagic stroke].
OBJECTIVE
To determine an optimal tactics of antihypertensive therapy in patients with hypertonic crisis complicated with hemorrhagic stroke.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 86 inpatients, 42 men and 44 women, aged 46-87 years, with hypertonic crisis complicated with hemorrhagic stroke.  The severity of neurological deficit, parameters of cardiac output and Kaplan-Meier survival curve based on the level of arterial pressure (AP) were assessed.
RESULTS
The best survival rate of the patients with systolic blood pressure >162 mm Hg to the 20th min from the beginning of treatment with the greater rate of its increase was established.
The efficacy of antihypertensive therapy did not depend on the baseline neurological deficit.
The remote survival rate did not depend on such factors as sex, age, baseline AP level, AP, frequency of heart contractions, hematoma's volume.
