[Restoration and reconstruction of extrahepatic bile ducts in high strictures using enteric autotransplant of variable diameter].
AIM
To develop technique incorporating favorable aspects of gastroenterostomy in common hepatic duct anastomosis, providing bile drainage into duodenum and preventing duodenobiliary reflux.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It is presented developed operations for high strictures of extrahepatic bile ducts using enteric autotransplant of variable diameter.  RESULTS
There were no recurrence of stricture, cholangitis and normal biochemical parameters were observed.  It has been proved that suggested methods may be alternative to Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.
