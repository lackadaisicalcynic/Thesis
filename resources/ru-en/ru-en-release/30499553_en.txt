[Dynamic of cerebrovascular disorders in patients with carotid stenosis].
AIM  To study the state of cerebral hemodynamics and platelet hemostasis in patients with carotid stenosis (CS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The prospective study included 123 patients with atherosclerotic CS.
The 1st group included 53 patients (mean age 52±12.5 yrs) who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA); the 2nd group - 70 patients who were treated conservatively (mean age 58.5±15.9 yrs).
The state of blood flow through the main arteries of the head (Doppler flowmetry), platelet aggregation induced by adrenaline, the frequency of acute cardiovascular events that occurred during 12 months were evaluated.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The severity of neurological deficits and cognitive impairment increased with increasing of the degree of CS.
CEA leads to an improvement of cerebral hemodynamics and stabilization of cognitive functions.
The adverse course of the disease occurred in 23.6% of patients (stroke/heart attack during the year in 5.7%, progression of cerebral ischemia in 20%, restenosis within 5 years after CEA in 15%).
Hyperaggregation of platelets induced by ADP and epinephrine and decreased aggregation of platelets induced by collagen in patients receiving ASA were identified in 53% of the operated and in 60% of non-operated patients.
The use of combined antiplatelet therapy normalize the platelet hemostasis and reduce the frequency of acute cardiovascular events.
