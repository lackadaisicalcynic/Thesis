[Cerebrovascular risks and prediction of complications in patients with backache during therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs].  AIM
To study the impact of therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as diclofenac, meloxicam, etoricoxib, and nimesulide, on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) changes in a short period (3 days), as well as the risk of acute transient ischemic attack, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and acute cardiovascular events within 6 months after NSAID use.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The follow-up included 66 patients (34 women and 32 men) who took NSAIDs for emergent low back pain.
RESULTS
The findings may suggest that etoricoxib-based therapy is highly effective and relatively safe for the management of acute nonspecific backache in patients with comorbidity.  The important feature is the established tendency towards BP destabilization in patients with chronic cerebrovascular diseases treated with NSAIDs (diclofenac, meloxicam, to a lesser extent, nimesulide).
After completion of drug intake for 14 days or longer, acute cerebral circulatory disorder and acute cerebrovascular event developed within 4.5 months in 3 and 2 patients, respectively.
CONCLUSION
Thus, the spectrum of possible adverse cardiovascular effects of NSAIDs is rather broad.
It is advisable to identify two major groups of NSAID-associated complications: 1) destabilized hypertension; 2) cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.
