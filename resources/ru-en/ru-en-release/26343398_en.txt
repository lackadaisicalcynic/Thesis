[Computer assisted modeling of endodontic access in mandibular and maxillary molars].  The paper describes the elaborated method of computer assisted manufacturing of plastic templates for optimal topography of endodontic access in molars according to CT and laser surface scanning data.
The method was tested on extracted teeth, its use in clinical practice will greatly reduce the errors rate and minimize the hard tissues loss by endodontic assess creation.
