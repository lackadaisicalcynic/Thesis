[Minimally invasive surgery for colorectal cancer in advanced age patients].  AIM
To evaluate the role of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer in advanced age patients.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
290 patients with colorectal cancer were enrolled including 121 patients with rectal cancer and 169 patients with colon cancer.
Main group consisted of 171 patients over 60 years old, control group - 119 patients younger 60 years old.
RESULTS
Radical advanced procedures on different parts of colon including laparoscopic approach were performed in the majority of advanced age patients.
Outcomes were considered as good, we did not notice serious complications (5.4% after rectal surgery, 3.9% after colon surgery).
Differences were not significant compared with younger patients including laparoscopic interventions for emergency indications.
Nevertheless, surgical treatment of advanced age patients with colorectal cancer makes special demands for equipping of the clinic and physicians' qualification.
CONCLUSION
Advanced age is not a serious limitation in choice of laparoscopic access in both elective and emergency surgery in patients with colorectal cancer.
