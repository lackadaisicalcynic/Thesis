[Association of the -844G>A polymorphism in the catalase gene with the increased risk of essential hypertension in smokers].
AIM
To investigate whether the functionally relevant -844G>A promotor polymorphism in the catalase (CAT) gene is associated with the development of essential hypertension (EH).  SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The investigation enrolled 2,339 unrelated ethnic Russian people, including 1,269 EH patients and 770 apparently healthy individuals.  Genotyping of CAT -844G>A (rs769214) polymorphism was performed using a TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay.
RESULTS
The -844A allele (odds ratio (OR)=1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04 to 1.64; р=0.02) and the -844AA genotype (OR=1.41; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.94; р=0.03) were found to be related to a higher risk of EH in the smokers.
No association was found between this polymorphism and EH risk in the non-smokers.
CONCLUSION
Smoking is a predisposing factor for development of EH in CAT -844AA genotype carriers.
