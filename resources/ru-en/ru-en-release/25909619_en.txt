[Long-term dental interventions in mentally retarded children under general anesthesia with sevoflurane].  Dental procedures in mentally retarded children is challenging for both dentist and for anesthesiologist.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dental care procedures under general anesthesia with sevoflurane by means of laryngeal mask in mentally retarded children.
The randomized controlled study included 65 mentally retarded children with ASA 2-3 who underwent dental treatment.  All patients had multiple caries.
The children were divided into two groups.  The first group included 35 children with normal body weigh while the second one - 30 obese children.
All patients received a rapid induction with sevoflurane with the subsequent installation of the laryngeal mask.
In the second group the signs of hypoventilation recorded an average of 10 ± 4 minutes after induction of anesthesia, which was manifested in increasing Pсо₂greater than 50 mm Hg.  In the first group, the signs of hypoventilation marked an average of 18 ± 3.5 minutes from the start of induction of anesthesia.
All patients were transferred to the artificial lung ventilation through the LMA.
By dental treatment under general anesthesia with sevoflurane and laryngeal mask all mentally retarded children had respiratory depression with increased levels of carbon dioxide greater than 50 mmHg, but obese children developed these signs of hypoventilation twice as fast.
Conducting long dental treatment in mentally retarded children require artificial lung ventilation.
