[A role of motivation for treatment in the structure of compliance in psychopharmacologically treated patients].
OBJECTIVE
To reveal an impact of specific motivation structures on the compliance in psychiatric inpatients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The Treatment Motivation Questionnaire and the Medication Compliance Scale have been administered to 104 patients, including 67 patients with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, 15 with affective disorders, 13 with personality and neurotic disorders and 9 with organic disorders, of the department of integrative pharmaco- and psychotherapy.  RESULTS
A motivational mechanism based on the subjective suffering from disease plays a key role in the formation of overall score of compliance.  Amotivation syndrome has a negative impact on the compliance.
"Passive agreement" attitude to treatment corresponds to a deficiency in both patient and physician compliance subsystems along with a reduction in insight and cognitive functions in the patient's subsystem.
Extreme external motivation for treatment correlates with insufficiently constructive support on the part of significant others in patient's environment subsystem resulting in the delay of internal motivation development.  Extremely low scores based on understanding of disease character leads to the deficiency of medication compliance subsystem.
