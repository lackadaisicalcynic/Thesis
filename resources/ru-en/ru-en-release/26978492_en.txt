[The systematics of psychogenic depressions (reactions of complicated grief)].
OBJECTIVE  Reactive depression provoked by the loss of loved ones is a controversial problem of modern psychiatry based on the diametrically opposite conceptions.
The author suggests a clinical typology of these depressions based on a psychopathological analysis of trigger mechanisms and constitutional predisposition.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-five patients, aged from 31 to 65 years (mean age 46.9±13.9 years), were examined.  The course of depression, including previous psychogenia, was followed up for 5-15 years (mean 11.5±3.6 years).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Three types of catathymic complexes (affective dissonance, affective resonance and affective imbalance) can be considered as a significant parameter responsible for trigger mechanisms of these psychogenias and their further dynamics.
Each type determines not only the psychopathological structure of psychogenic depression but has a predictive validity thus allowing to predict the dynamics of depression and its nosological attribution.
