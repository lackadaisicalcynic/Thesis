[Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures: issues of comorbidity in the diagnosis and treatment].  The paper presents a case report of seizures in a man of 40 years who was assessed by neurologists and psychiatrists for 15 years.
Due to the low efficacy of treatment and permanent health deterioration, the patient was recognized as disabled.
Later initial diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures was completed by comorbid diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, type II. Treatment with lamotrigine improved the patient's condition.  It has been regarded as a positive effect on organic changes in the brain that are associated with affective and epileptic disorders.
