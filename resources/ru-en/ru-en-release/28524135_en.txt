AIM  to evaluate the effect of dexamethasone intravitreal implant on the functional state of the eye in macular edema associated with central retinal vein occlusion.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included two groups of patients: group 1 (control group) - 8 patients (16 eyes) without ocular pathology and group 2 (study group) - 8 patients (8 eyes) with macular edema on the background of newly diagnosed thrombosis of the central retinal vein.
All the patients from the study group underwent insertion of an intravitreal dexamethasone implant - Ozurdex.
Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and retinal light sensitivity of the central visual field were followed up.
The maximum follow-up period was 12 months.
RESULTS
In group 1 (controls), BCVA averaged 0.93±0.2 and retinal light sensitivity of the central visual field - 19.01±1.18 dB.  In group 2, baseline BCVA and retinal light sensitivity were 0.08±0.02 and 4.23±0.2 dB, 1 month after Ozurdex implantation - 0.21±0.04 and 11.77±0.98 dB, at 12 months - 0.23±0.17 and 5.2±0.78 dB, respectively.
CONCLUSION
Macular edema associated with central retinal vein thrombosis has a strong deteriorating effect on the functional state of the eye.
The dexamethasone intravitreal implant in patients with postthrombotic macular edema contributes to functional improvement, including BCVA and light sensitivity of the central retina, over the first year.
At that, different functional parameters show different dynamics after dexamethasone treatment.  Light sensitivity values, in contrast to BCVA, change unevenly and significantly during the year.
Intravitreal implantation of a dexamethasone implant in patients with postthrombotic macular edema is an effective symptomatic treatment of occlusive processes within the retinal venous system.
