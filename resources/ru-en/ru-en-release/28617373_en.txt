[A psychological content of social phobia syndrome].
AIM  To perform a psychological analysis of social phobia syndrome.
The subject area of research is the structure of mental activity and behavior in social activity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 32 patients with symptoms of social phobia (ICD-10 F40.1) and 29 healthy people (controls).
A complex of psychological methods (questionnaires; pathopsychological experiment) was used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Early maladaptive schemes and a tendency to mental rigidity can be a premorbid basis of the syndrome.
Primary violation is in organizational target component by type of distortion of goal-setting regulation.
The mechanism is a reduction in the mediation of emotions and behavior (an influence of emotions on the process of activity, excess metacognitive anxiety control leading to multi-task and exhaustion of resources of voluntary activity).
Fear of negative evaluation leads to the fact that a wide class of situations is interpreted as threatening.
Secondary are changes in the system of goals and motives of activity (technically performing components of social behavior act as a focus of attention, along with the target, the target replaces the suprasituational meaning).
Along with a strong motivation to succeed, the motive of avoiding failure is formed, which leads to a decrease in social activity.  Tertiary symptoms of syndrome dynamics (ways to cope with maladaptation) are destructive forms of decompensation (substance abuse, learned helplessness and hopelessness, suicidal behavior, etc.), repeatedly reinforcing the primary and secondary disturbances.
