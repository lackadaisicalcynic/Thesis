[The morphological substrate and molecular mechanisms of impaired pregnancy outcomes in women with hereditary thrombophilias and undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia].
Hereditary thrombophilias (HT) and undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia (uCTD) are important causes of female infertility.
Moreover, there are signs of their common pathogenesis: a number of proteins, such as PAI-1, play an important role in the pathogenesis of both conditions, as well as in the development of infertility in patients with HT and uCTD OBJECTIVE: To determine the morphological substrate and molecular mechanisms of impaired pregnancy outcomes in women with uCTD and HT.
SUBJECT AND METHODS: A study group included 130 reproductive-aged female patients with primary infertility and a control group consisted of 11 patients (surrogate mothers).
An endometrial pipelle biopsy sample was taken from each patient on days 6-8 after ovulation according to the ultrasound findings.
The study group patients were divided into subgroups: 1A) infertility and HT (n=91); 1B) infertility, NT, and uCTD (n=19); 1C) infertility and uCTD (n=20).
