[Central female hypogonadism as a model of premature aging].  Central (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism in women could also be a cause of persistent amenorrhea and hypoestrogenemia.
The aim of this study was to evaluate symptoms of premature aging in women of young age with central hypogonadism.
88 young women (25 [21; 30] y.o.) with central hypogonadism (with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism n=42, and associated with the other types of pituitary insufficiencies n=46), 53 healthy young women (24 [23; 28] y.o.) and 50 healthy postmenopausal women (56 [53; 58] y.o.) were examined.
In young women with central hypogonadism frequency of psychoemotional, neurovegetative and urogenital disorders, peripheral sex steroid concentrations, lipid and mineral homeostasis parameters differed significantly from the healthy young women of similar age and were comparable with postmenopausal women of middle/older age.  Thus, according to clinical, hormonal and biochemical abnormalities biological age of female patients with central hypogonadism advanced significantly chronological young age and corresponded to middle/older age.
The central female hypogonadism is a model of premature aging.
