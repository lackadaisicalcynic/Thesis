[Preclinical tests of additive materials for personified endoprostheses of hand joints].
AIM
To evaluate the biocompatibility of additive materials for personified endoprostheses of hand joints in vivo.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We tested a material based on titanium that was implanted into muscles and bone tissue in experiment on rabbits.
Follow-up was 30 and 90 days.
RESULTS
Implantation into muscle tissue is accompanied by reaction against foreign body followed by fibrosis without concomitant inflammation.
Induction of osteogenesis and trabecular structures remodeling were detected after implantation into bone tissue.
CONCLUSION
Biocompatibility of tested titanium-based material was confirmed.
