[Associated Liver Partition and Portal vein ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) in focal liver diseases management].  AIM  To determine ALPPS advisability in small future remnant liver.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
22 ALPPS procedures were performed at the Center for Surgery and Transplantology for the period from 2011 to 2016.  Indications were both tumoral and non-tumoral unresectable liver diseases.
Postoperative complications were classified according to Clavien-Dindo, ISGLS.
RESULTS
According to CT-volumetry future remnant liver before the 1st stage of ALPPS was from 17 to 25%, before the 2nd stage - from 28 to 49%.
Both stages were carried out in all patients with R0-resection in 100%.
Postoperative complications were diagnosed in 40.9%, 1 death was caused by severe pulmonary embolism.
Follow-up varied from 3 to 48 months (median 17.5), 86% of patients are alive at present.
CONCLUSION
ALPPS provides rapid and effective FLR growth and can be used for both tumoral and non-tumoral unresectable liver diseases.  However, ALPPS should be performed strictly according to indications and only in specialized centers with extensive experience of advanced liver resection and transplantation after previous comprehensive selection of patients.
