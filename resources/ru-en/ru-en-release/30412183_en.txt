[Etiopathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnoea and its consequences in the children].  The article presents the modern view of etiology of the obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OAHSS) in the children taking into consideration the ontogenetic stage and the principal mechanisms of its formation including the short-term and long-term consequences of sleep apnoea with special reference to the pathogenetic commonness of OAHSS with endothelial dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, cardiac disorders, and systemic chronic inflammation.
The role of ENT diseases in the children with obstructive sleep apnoea is discussed.
The results of genetic studies of the processes influencing the formation of the risk of development of sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome and its outcomes in the children are discussed.
