[The peculiarities of deposition of foreign particles in the skin region experimentally damaged by the electrical saw cutting element].  The objective of the present study was to detect the deposition of foreign particles and other introduced objects in the human skin region damaged by the electrical saw cutting elements and to use the data thus obtained for the estimation of the speed and the type of the instrument, the main characteristics of the cutter covering and/or composition of its surface.
The experiments included the sawing of the skin fragments using the small steel saws differing in the type of the surface cover, such as the uncoated (steel), stained, nickel- or chromium-plated, blue-finished saws with the movement speed of the cutting element 500, 1000, 2500, 2,000, and 3,000 revolutions per minute.
The study provided information about the peculiarities of deposition of foreign particles and other introduced objects in the damaged regions of the human skin that allow not only to establish the fact of using the electrical saw with a high-speed back-and-forth movements of the cutting element but also the type of the instrument and the main characteristics of its cover and/or the composition of its surface.
