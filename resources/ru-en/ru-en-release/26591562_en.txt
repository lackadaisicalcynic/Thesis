[Role of measurement of fractional flow reserve in coronary artery atherosclerosis].  The paper considers coronary flow in health and coronary flow autoregulation in health and disease.
It gives basic methods used to estimate coronary flow reserve in patients with coronary atherosclerosis.
The physiological bases for determining fractional flow reserve are presented.
Clinical trials investigating the use of fractional flow reserve in patients with coronary heart disease are analyzed.
