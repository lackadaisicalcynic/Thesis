[A role of antioxidants in the complex treatment of epilepsy].  The article covers the pathogenesis of epilepsy and goals of modern pharmacotherapy.
The features of the development of epilepsy of vascular origin are presented as well.
The authors describe the ways to increase the efficacy and decrease side-effects of anticonvulsants (a combination with antioxidant and antihypoxant drugs that was confirmed by the data on an important role of free-radical processes in the pathogenesis of epilepsy).  Mechanisms of action and efficacy of antioxidant treatment (on the example of 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate - mexidol) in the complex treatment of various forms of epilepsy are analyzed.
The main advantages of mexidol as an add-on drug in the treatment of various types of epileptic syndrome in adults, taking into account its neuroprotective and antihypoxant action, are considered.
Literature results have shown the positive effect of mexidol on the course of disease and its safety in the treatment of epilepsy.
