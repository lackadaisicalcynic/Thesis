[Changes of the auditory function in he children with chronic kidney failure].  The risk factors that contribute to the development of hearing loss in the children with chronic kidney failure (CRF) are complications and/or manifestations of the disease itself as well as the side effects of its treatment.
There are many similarities between the anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological features of the nephron and the striavascularis of the cochlea.  The objective of the present study was the evaluation of the status of the auditory function in the children presenting with CRF.
A total of 62 children with CRF were examined.  40 patients were on peritoneal dialysis and 9 on hemodialysis whereas 13 children did not receive hemodialysis.
The registration of transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) was performed in all the children.  For patients without TEOAE complex underwent the audiological examination.
RESULTS  The TEOAE was not registered in 17 of the 62 examined children.
According to the results of the comprehensive audiological examinations, 13 children suffered from the hearing loss of different forms and severity while 5 children presented with bilateral deafness.  As the duration of CRF progressed, the patients became more prone to develop hearing impairment.
Hearing loss is possibly genetically determined.  Among the etiological factors underlying the development of the hearing loss the high doses of immunosuppressants and aminoglycosides are considered to be the principal ones.
