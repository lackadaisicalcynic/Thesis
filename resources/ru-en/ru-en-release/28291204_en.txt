[Staged complex treatment of paralytic lagophthalmos (case report)].  Paralytic lagophthalmos, resulting from facial nerve palsy, is a difficult medical and social issue that requires cooperation of different specialists.
Complications that arise in paralytic lagophthalmos may cause significant vision loss and even eye loss.
Various techniques of paralytic lagophthalmos correction are used to protect the cornea and restore eyelid anatomy and functions.  These comprise palliative (conservative), surgical, and alternative treatments (such as botulinum toxin type A therapy).
Surgical treatment of paralytic lagophthalmos patients often has to be staged and complex.  This article presents a clinical case of a female patient with paralytic lagophthalmos complicated by corneal perforation.
Her staged complex treatment included lower eyelid surgery, chemodenervation of the upper eyelid levator and optical reconstructive surgery.
The following positive results were achieved: the protective function of the eyelids was restored, residual visual functions - preserved, the risk of eye loss - eliminated, and the asymmetry between the two halves of the face - corrected.
