[Association of adiponectin gene G276T polymorphism with the development of metabolic syndrome in ethnic Kyrgyz patients].  AIM
To study the association of adiponectin gene G276Т (ADIPOQ) polymorphism with the development of metabolic syndrome (MS) in ethnic Kyrgyz patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 171 patients with MS (a study group) and 117 patients without MS (a comparison group) were examined.
MS was defined on the basis of the modified ATP III criteria.  The genotypes of the G276T polymorphism in the adiponectin gene were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
RESULTS
Dividing the MS and control groups by gender revealed statistically significant differences in the distribution of alleles and genotypes only among the women.
There was a higher frequency of GT+TT genotypes (53% vs 34%; χ2=5.942; р=0.014) and T allele (30% vs 19%; χ2=4.489; р=0.0341) in the women with MS than in those without MS.
Iin the ethnic Kyrgyz women, the T allele at the G276Т polymorphic locus in the ADIPOQ gene was associated with the development of MS (odds ratio (OR)=1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-3.19) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (OR=2.63; 95% CI, 1.05-6.56 ) with the high levels of leptin (p<0.05), glucose (p<0.05), triglycerides (OR=3.06; 95% CI, 1.05-8.93), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR=2.80; 95% CI, 1,07-7.31) and with the lower level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR=2.9; 95% CI, 1.15-7.24).
CONCLUSION
The risk for MS, T2DM, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia is related to the carriage of the T allele of the G276Т polymorphism in the ADIPOQ gene in ethnic Kyrgyz women.
