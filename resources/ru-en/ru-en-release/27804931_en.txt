Patients with achalasia (72 cases) underwent videolaparoscopic Geller's esophagomyotomy with anterior hemiesophagofundoplication by Dor.  Video-assisted thoracoscopic extirpation of the esophagus with simultaneous or delayed esophagocolo/gastroplasty was performed in 56 patients with post-ambustial cicatricial stenosis of the esophagus.
Mortality rate was 5.4% (3 out of 56 patients) and 14.3% (2 out of 14 patients) in groups of cicatricial esophageal stenosis and esophageal perforation respectively.  Sutures failure after removal of the diverticulum and leiomyoma occurred in 2 and 1 patient respectively and has been successfully cured.
Endoscopic technologies allow to perform successfully complex reconstructive interventions for dysphagia in patients with cicatricial esophageal stenosis and achalasia even at late stages, to remove benign tumors and diverticula of thoracic esophagus and provide adequate drainage of posterior mediastinum in case of esophageal perforation.
