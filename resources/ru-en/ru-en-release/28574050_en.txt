[Haemangioma of the left atrium].  Presented herein is a clinical case report concerning successful surgical management of a rare variety of a primary tumour of the heart, i. e., a capillary haemangioma of the left atrium, simulating by the contours and localization a myxoma.
The final diagnosis was verified only by histological examination.
The authors describe difficulties of diagnosis of the disease involved, underlying the necessity of plastic correction for restoration of the normal anatomical configuration of the heart.
This is followed by a review of the literature, reflecting a possible course of the disease, problems of diagnosis, and therapeutic policy.
