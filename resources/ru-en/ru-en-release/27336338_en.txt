[Results of endovascular interventions in patients with occlusive stenotic lesions of arteries of the aortoiliac segment].  Presented herein are the results of endovascular interventions performed in a total of 220 patients with chronic ischaemia of lower limbs and occlusive and stenotic lesions of the aortoiliac arterial segment.
Group One patients (n=155) underwent angioplasty with stenting (a total of 186 interventions performed) and Group Two patients (n=65) were subjected to recanalization of the occlusion zone with stenting (65 interventions).
The remote results were assessed in all patients within the terms of up to 4 years.
In Group One patients, restenosis of the stented segments within the mentioned terms of follow up was revealed in 11 (7.1%) cases, thrombosis - in 5 (3.2%) cases.
In Group Two patients restenosis was detected in 3 (4.6%) cases and thrombosis of the stented segment in 6 (9.2%) cases.
In the both groups, restenosis >50% or thrombosis of the stented segment developed significantly more often with the length of the stented segment exceeding 100 mm (p=0.01 in Group One and p=0.0077 in Group Two).
Primary patency of the stented segments at 12 and 24 months after the intervention in Group One amounted to 97.5±1.5 and 92.3±3.3% and in Group Two 92.7±3.6 and 81.9±6.6%, respectively.
A conclusion was made that endovascular interventions may be a method of choice in occlusive and stenotic lesions of the aortoiliac-segment arteries.
Extended length of the lesion of iliac-segment arteries (more than 100 mm) deteriorates the rates of primary patency after stenting.
