[Evolution of the mandibular defects reconstruction with free fibula flapx].
One of the most important steps in achieving aesthetical and functional result in mandible reconstruction with fibula free flap is positioning of the bony part relative to the basis of the native mandible.  Positioning fibular bony part continuing inferior mandible border may produce a high discrepancy between the residual mandible and fibula bone that results in difficulty in denture rehabilitation.
Positioning fibular bony part continuing alveolar mandible border creates asymmetric jowls and changed shape of jawline in border-line zone.  The double-barrel technique solves this problem, but needs a meticulous preoperative planning and precision free fibula flap modelling.
