[Mixed dementia: the role of cerebrovascular pathology].  Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are two most common causes of dementia in late life.
The combination of Alzheimer's type dementia and vascular dementia is the third most common form of dementia, especially in the elderly.
Most clinical forms of dementia are characterized by the presence of 'overlap' symptoms of both neurodegenerative and vascular pathology, which makes it expedient to consider mixed dementia as a separate entity characterized by clinical presentations, course and the rate of progression of cognitive decline.
Despite the lack of clinical guidelines for management of patients with mixed dementia, it seems appropriate to use strategies that have shown their effectiveness in various types of cognitive impairment.
