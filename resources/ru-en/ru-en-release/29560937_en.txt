[An influence of submaximal (submineximal) doses of mexidol on oxidant stress and inflammation in the acute period of ischemic stroke].
AIM
To study an effect of submaximal doses of mexidol on the dynamics of biochemical markers of inflammation and damage to brain tissue in the acute period of ischemic stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  A total of 60 patients admitted in the first 6h after disease onset with a verified ischemic stroke (7-9 points on the ASPECT scale) were enrolled in the study.
Thirty patients in the study group received submaximal doses of mexidol: 750 mg infusion dropwise in 250 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution for 6 days.
Thirty patients of the control group received standard therapy.  Biomarkers and neurological status were evaluated within 60 minutes from the time of admission to the hospital and after 6 days.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
In both groups, the changes in CRP, IL-6, and fibrinogen did not contribute to the efficacy of mexidol.
The brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) biomarker, plasma-A-associated pregnancy (PAPP-A) biomarker, average NIHSS score and mean cerebroasthenia score on the MFI-20 scale in the study group were significantly reduced compared to the control group.  This study indicates a decrease in oxidative stress and signs of inflammation, a reduction of the severity of neurological deficit and an increase in physical activity of patients treated with submaximal doses of mexidol.
Given the activation time of the damaged antioxidant system of the body, the recommended period of treatment is 3 months.
