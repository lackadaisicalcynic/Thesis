[Application of TNF-alpha inhibitors in treatment of uveitis associated with ankylosing spondylitis].
Uveitis is one of the most frequent extraskeletal manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).  Despite iridocyclitis being the most prevalent form of uveitis in patients with AS, and the rareness of the involvement of posterior eye segments in the inflammatory process, the frequent exacerbation of the disease, a significant number of patients develop complications that lead to decrease of visual acuity.
The review features theoretical prerequisites for application of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors: infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept.
Literature data speaks for high efficacy of TNF-alpha inhibitors in prevention and arrest of uveitis onset in patients with AS.
