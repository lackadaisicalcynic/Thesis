[Sex differences in acute disturbances of cerebral blood circulation].
It is shown that in the development of stroke observed sex differences, which manifest themselves both clinically and by laboratory parameters.  While men have a higher incidence of stroke for most of his life, a woman in a more advanced age have a higher risk for stroke.
Sex differences in the development of stroke depend on several factors, including genetic and hormonal changes throughout life.  Studies sex differences in the risk of stroke is only in the initial stage, but the first results show that there are differences in neuronal cell death in males and females after experimental ischemic stroke.
A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of stroke in men and women will lead to more appropriate treatment strategies for patients of both sexes.
