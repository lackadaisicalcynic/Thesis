[An expert assessment of medical care quality in patients with acute disturbances of cerebral blood flow at prehospital stage].
OBJECTIVE
To study the criteria of expert assessment of medical care quality in patients with acute disturbances of cerebral blood flow at prehospital stage in the Smolensk region.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We analyzed the adequacy of medical care to regulation documents of the Russian Federation and worked out several assessment criteria.  Based on these criteria, we selected and analyzed 190 ambulance care records over 1 month.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The quality of ambulance care was estimated on a three-level scale: satisfactory, satisfactory with minor deficiencies, unsatisfactory.
In the Smolensk region, it is characterized by relatively low estimates.
These criteria allow to fairly assess the quality of medical care for patients with acute disturbances of cerebral blood flow at prehospital stage.
