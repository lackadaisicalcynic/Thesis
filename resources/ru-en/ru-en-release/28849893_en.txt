[Age dynamics of cognitive functions in persons 50-85 years].  The paper presents original study results of cognitive changes associated with aging in the absence of neurodegenerative, vascular and other significant for cognition disorders in period from 50 to 85 years.
It was shown that aging is associated with moderate memory decrease predominantly because of retrieval deficit but not acquisition insufficiency.  It was also shown that aging is associated with non-severe executive dysfunction (lack of planning and control).
According usual neuropsychological approaches pattern of cognitive changes described above reflects anterior cortical dysfunction or/and impaired interaction between frontal lobes and subcortical basal ganglia.  Shows what physiological changes occur with age in the field of memory and executive functions, which is of great clinical importance for the differential diagnosis of normal aging and early stages of common in the elderly cerebral diseases.
