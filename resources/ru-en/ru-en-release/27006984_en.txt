[The hearing function in the premature infants].  The present review of the literature is focused on the morphological and functional aspects of antenatal ontogenesis of the hearing system with special reference to the peculiar features of its formation during the post-natal period in the premature infants.
In this context, the results of the objective psychoacoustic investigation s are considered (including those obtained by such methods as threshold audiometry, verbal and non-verbal tests, evaluation of central auditory processing of the sound information).  Also presented are the results of the objective methods of hearing investigations (acoustic impedancometry, registration of optoacoustic emission and auditory evoked potentials).
The underdevelopment of the hearing system in the premature infants manifests itself as the specific functional features of all its components.
Their parameters are presented with reference to dynamics of their formation.
In addition, the problem of central auditory processing of the disorders that are very likely to be present in the premature infants are discussed.
