[Nesidioblastosis (diagnosis, surgical treatment)].  INTRODUCTION
Nesidioblastosis (NB) is rare disease with organic hyperinsulinism syndrome and caused by diffuse hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy of pancreatic islands of Langerhans.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of surgical treatment of 3 patients with NB are presented.  In all patients the diagnosis was suspected at the preoperative stage and confirmed by histological examination later.
Herewith in 2 patients NB was combined with insulinoma.  All patients underwent corpora-caudal pancreatectomy.
In postoperative period one patient hadnot episodes of hypoglycemia for the entire follow-up period (5 months), in another patient hypoglycemic states occurred at 1.5 months after surgery.  The third patient required pancreatic head extirpation at 11 days after surgery due to persistent severe course of organic hyperinsulinism.
In immediate postoperative period in the same patient hyperinsular hypoglycemia was observed that pointed on extrapancreatic source of insulin secretion.  However contrast-enhanced CT did not reveal any formations.
CONCLUSION
Thus, corpora-caudal pancreatectomy is preferable as surgical treatment.  Results of surgical management can provide a complete regression of the symptoms, but do not guarantee absence of recurrence and even any changes in frequency and severity of hypoglycemic states.
