[Self-consciousness in elderly persons with cognitive impairment and vascular dementia].  Self-consciousness was compared in 17 elderly (aged 65-89 years old) persons with cognitive impairment without dementia and 17 patients with vascular dementia.
Neurocognitive functions and mental health complaints were evaluated.
Neuropsychological assessment included evaluation of higher psychological functions, such as attention, memory, conceptualization, gnosis (optic, acoustic), manual skill, speech.  Older persons with cognitive impairment assessed their neurocognitive functions adequately.
Patients with vascular dementia usually denied cognitive deficit or explained it as a result of aging.  Regardless of physical health, older persons with cognitive impairment have active attitude to aging.
They could find ways of compensation of cognitive deficits without assistance.
Patients with vascular dementia could not compensate their cognitive deficit even with support.
