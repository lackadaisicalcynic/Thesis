[The state of the serotonin system in the patients presenting with chronic polypous rhinosinusitis].  This article presents the results of the study designed to determine the concentration of the neuromediator serotonin in the blood serum and tissue homogenates prepared from the polypous tissue harvested in the patients presenting with chronic polypous rhinosinusitis (CPR).
The study included 51 patients with this pathology while 11 patients with chronic maxillary rhinosinusitis (CMR) and deflection of the nasal septum (DNS) made up the group of comparison.  The serum serotonin levels were measured and compared in the patients of the main and both control groups.
The results obtained give evidence of the significant inverse correlation between serotonin levels in the sera and tissue homogenates on the one hand and the history of allergic diseases in individual patients on the other hand.
