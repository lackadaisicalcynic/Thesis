[Histological hanges in the placenta and vascularization of its villi in early- and late-onset preeclampsia].
AIM
to make a comparative histological study of the placenta and a morphometric analysis of its terminal villi in early- and late-onset preeclampsia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Placentae from patients whose pregnancy had been complicated by the development of early- (n=26) or late-onset (n=84) preeclampsia were examined.  A control group comprised placentae from 28 patients with physiological pregnancy and no extragenital diseases.
The authors made a comparative histological study of placental tissue and a morphometric analysis of the terminal villi using the sections immunohistochemically stained for CD31.
RESULTS
It was determined that there was a preponderance of branching angiogenesis in the preeclamptic chorionic villi and an increase in the number of syncytial nodules and microcysts in the septae in late-onset preeclampsia.
Morphometric analysis of immunohistochemical placental specimens established a reduction in the sizes and vascularization indicators of terminal villi that determine the development of placental hypoxia and are more pronounced in cases of early-onset preeclampsia.
