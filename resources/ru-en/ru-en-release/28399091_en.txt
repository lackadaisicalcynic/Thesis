RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Depressive disorders complicated by consumption of and dependence on alcohol were comparable for the clinical picture, family history, premorbid features.
At the same time, they had a number of differences.
In patients with alcohol abuse in depressive syndrome, anxious and melancholic depressions were more frequent.
They were complicated with alcohol dependence, were more severe, had less favorite outcomes and a trend toward prolonged course and were more psychopathologically polymorphic.
