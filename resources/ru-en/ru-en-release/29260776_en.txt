[The possibilities for the restoration of the laryngeal function: the current state-of-the-art].  The restoration of the functional competence of the larynx following bilateral laryngeal nerve damage and vocal fold paralysis is a serious challenge for the surgeon that has thus far no satisfactory solution.
Physiological re-innervation that occurs naturally with time is non-selective and, in the majority of the cases, leads to synkinesis.  Laryngeal pacing achieved with the application of the implantable microchips appears to be a promising approach.
The animal experiments have demonstrated the possibility of successful restoration of all the functions of the larynx by means of laryngeal pacing but simultaneously revealed a number of technical issues that have to be addressed if the further progress in this field is to be achieved including the choice of the proper materials for implantation, solution of problems pertaining to the neuromuscular mapping during pacer implantation, etc.).
The results of the first prospective clinical trial involving the human patients gave evidence suggesting that the laryngeal electrostimulation technology is both safe and efficient.  Nevertheless, further investigations and modification of the method are needed before it can be recommended for the wider application in the routine clinical practice.
