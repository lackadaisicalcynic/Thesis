The objective of the present retrospective study based on the analysis of 791 medical cards was to investigate microflora localized at the pharyngeal tonsil surface in the children living in the city of Chelyabinsk and presenting with exacerbation of chronic adenoiditis.  66% of the patients with this condition were 4-6 year old children.
The most commonly documented were the associations composed of resident species S. alpha-haemoliticus and S. epidermidis together with pathobiontic S. aureus.
S. beta-haemoliticus and S. pneumoniae occurred most frequently whereas H. influenza and some representatives of the genus Enterobacteriaceae were less numerous.
Fungi of the genus Candida were identified in 25.4% of the samples at a titer above 10^4.  In 23.7% of the cases, these fungi were found in the associations with S. aureus which resulted in mutual potentiation of the pathogenicity factor.
