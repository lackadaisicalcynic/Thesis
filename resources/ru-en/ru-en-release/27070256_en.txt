[Overall survival and intracranial relapse in patients with brain metastases after gamma knife radiosurgery alone].  UNLABELLED
The study purpose was to evaluate the impact of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) alone on the overall survival and rate of intracranial recurrences in brain metastasis patients.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Treatment outcomes in 502 patients (211 males and 291 females with 2782 brain metastases (BMs)) were retrospectively reviewed.  Most patients (n=142; 28.2%) were diagnosed with breast cancer.
Multiple BMs were detected in 259 patients (51.6%).  The median of the total tumor volume and ВM number was 5.9 cm3 (0.09-44.5 cm3) and 4 (1-36), respectively.
The mean marginal radiation dose was 21 Gy (15-24 Gy).  The mean follow-up period was 10.6 months (0.2-47.2 months).
RESULTS
The overall survival rate for 12 and 24 months was 37.6 and 19.1%, respectively.  The median overall survival after GKRS was 8.6 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.0-10.0).
Local control of metastatic lesions was achieved in 78.8% of patients.  The median local recurrence-free survival was 6.8 months after radiosurgery.
The development of new (distant) metastases was observed in 49.5% of patients.
The median distant metastasis-free time was 8.8 months.  The Karnofsky performance score (KPS) of ≥80 (HR 0.3935, 95% CI 0.2429-0.6376; p=0.0002), BM number of <3 (HR 0.6138, 95% CI 0.3993-0.9943; p=0.0269), and BMs of breast and lung cancers (HR 0.5442, 95% CI 0.3642-0.8071; p=0.0027) are predictors of better survival.
In the case of intracranial metastasis recurrence, repeated radiosurgery provides the median overall survival of 19.6 months versus 9.6 months in patients without radiosurgery (HR 0.4026, 95% CI 0.2381-0.6809).
CONCLUSION
Radiosurgical treatment of patients with multiple BMs provides the median overall survival of 8.6 months.
A good functional status, non-extensive metastasis of the brain, and radiosensitive morphology of the primary tumor are the predictors of better survival.
Repeated radiosurgical treatment for intracranial recurrences provides longer overall survival compared to that in patients without repeated radiosurgical treatment.
