[Paradoxical air embolism resulted in acute myocardial infarction and massive ischemic brain injury in a patient operated on in a sitting position].  Paradoxical air embolism (PAE) is a rare life-threatening complication when air emboli enter arteries of the systemic circulation and cause their occlusion.
Here, we describe a clinical case of PAE developed during neurosurgery in a patient in the sitting position.
PAE led to injuries to the cerebral blood vessels, coronary arteries, and lungs, which caused death of the patient.
An effective measure for preventing PAE is abandoning surgery in the sitting position in favor of surgery in the prone position.
