[Prоgnosis of motor function recovery in ischemic stroke using diffusion tensor MRI].
AIM  To identify factors of motor recovery in ischemic stroke (IS) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty-seven patients with IS were studied within 1-2, 7-8, 14-15, 20-21 days after stroke.
The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the pyramidal tract were measured in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, cerebral peduncle and pons.
Relative values of FA (rFA) ratio (rFA=FA affected side/FA unaffected side) were assessed as well.
RESULTS
rFA≤0.7 in the cerebral peduncule and posterior limb of the internal capsule accurately predicted poor motor outcome in ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSION
DTI can evaluate the motor deficit quantitatively and may predict the functional prognosis in patients with IS.
