[Comparative analysis of the effectiveness of various techniques of endoscopic prostate enucleation in a single center].  AIM
MATERIAL AND METHODS  693 prostate hyperplasia patients were enrolled. 489 patients underwent holmium enucleation (HoLEP), 51 - monopolar enucleation, 153 - thulium enucleation (ThuLEP).
Prostate volume was 91.7 (50-250) cm3.  There were no significant differences in preoperative variables between both groups (I-PSS, QoL, Qmax, residual urine volume) (p>0.05).
Mean time of HoLEP was 97.0±42.2 min, monopolar enucleation - 112.9±36.3 min, ThuLEP duration was significantly less (77.4±36.3 min, p<0.01).  An efficacy of all methods was confirmed in 6 months after surgery by significant (p<0.01) improvement of functional parameters (I-PSS, QoL, Qmax, residual urine volume).
CONCLUSION  High efficiency of thulium and holmium enucleation allows to consider them as 'gold standard' of prostate hyperplasia management.
Despite higher incidence of complications an efficacy of monopolar enucleation is comparable to that in laser techniques.
