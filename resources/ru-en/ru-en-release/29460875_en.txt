[Staged approach for hybrid thoracoabdominal aortic replacement].  AIM
To generalize our experience of step-by-step hybrid thoracoabdominal aortic replacement.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Twenty-three patients were enrolled who underwent staged hybrid treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm.
There were 5 (21.7%) women and 18 (78.3%) men aged 61.4Â±8.3 years (37-74 years).
The first stage was proximal debranching, the second - distal (abdominal) procedure and the third - stenting of the thoracoabdominal aorta.
RESULTS
There were no any complications after proximal debranching and aortic stenting.
Abdominal debranching was followed by lethal outcome in 3 (13.0%) patients and early postoperative occlusion of the prosthesis brunch in 3 out of 87 cases.
CONCLUSION
Staged approach for hybrid surgical treatment is optimal solution, especially in high risk patients.
In our opinion no necessity for cardiopulmonary bypass is the main advantage of this technique.
