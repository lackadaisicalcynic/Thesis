[Quality of life of the patients who had an atherotrombotic stroke in the carotid artery territory].  AIM  To assess quality of life of patients with first-ever atherothrombotic stroke in the carotid artery territory 2 years after the disease onset.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 119 patients.  Quality of life was measured with the «SF-36 Health Status Survey» using two parameters: level of mental (MH) and physical (PH) health.
A control group consisted of 20 sex- and age-matched healthy persons without neurological diseases.
RESULTS
After two years, 67% of the patients assessed their health condition as satisfactory.
In the patients, a decrease in PH was greater compared to MH than in controls.
CONCLUSION
In post-stroke period, patients for a long time had lower quality of life indices with marked physical impairment.
Elimination of or reduction in the focal neurological deficit that led to the decrease in the level of physical wellbeing may be considered as a significant rehabilitation reserve.
