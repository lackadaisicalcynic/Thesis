[The phenomenon of attachment to parents, the duration of therapeutic remissions and autoaggressive behavior among inpatients with alcohol addiction].  OBJECTIVE
To determine the role of phenomenon of attachment to parents in the formation of therapeutic remission and the relationship between attachment styles and autoaggressive behavior in patients with alcohol addiction (AA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty-two patients with AA and 30 controls were examined.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Insecure attachment styles were most frequents in AA patients that indicated a role of attachment pathology in the development of the disease.  Higher frequency of secure and preoccupied styles were noted in patients with AA with the duration of therapeutic remissions more than one year compared to those with shorter duration.
No effect of duration of therapeutic remission on autoaggressive behavior was found in patients who did not receive special treatment.
In AA patients, avoidant style was correlated with autoaggression in family and professional spheres, and high-anxious style was correlated with classical autoaggression in the form of antisocial behavior.
