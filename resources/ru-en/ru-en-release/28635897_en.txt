[The functional disturbances in the vegetative nervous system associated with nasal and paranasal sinuses pathology].  The authors undertook the analysis of the literature data on the functional state of the vegetative nervous system (VNS) in the patients presenting with otorhinolaryngological pathology.
These data suggest the participation of VNS in the origin and development of many ENT diseases.  Moreover, they demonstrate the absence of commonly accepted approaches to the study of VNS and the assessment of clinical manifestations of vegetative dysfunction syndrome.
The necessity of the further investigationsinto this problem is emphasized taking into consideration various types of vegetative constitution in the patients suffering from diseases of the upper respiratory tract.
