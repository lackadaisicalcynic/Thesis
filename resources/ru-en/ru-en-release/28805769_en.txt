[New classifications of epilepsies and seizure types created by the International League against Epilepsy (2017)].
This review presents the recently published revised classifications of epilepsies and seizure types developed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).
The Classification of Epilepsies includes several diagnostic levels (steps): 1) from seizure type to epilepsy type (generalized/focal/combined generalized and focal/unknown), 2) diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome 3) etiology (genetic/ structural/ infectious/ metabolic/ immune/unknown).
A clinician can use any level of the classification.
Operational classification of seizure types is replaced by the previous classification that was grounded on the anatomical basis.
Seizures are classified by the onset (focal, generalized or unknown).  All types of seizures can be motor or non-motor.
Focal seizure may evolve to bilateral tonic-clonic (previously called secondary-generalized).
Atonic, clonic, tonic, myoclonic seizures and epileptic spasms can be either of focal or generalized onset.  Unclassified type of seizure was introduced.
New types of seizures (absence with eyelid myoclonia, myoclonic absence, myoclonic atonic and clonic-tonic-clonic seizures) were added.  New terminology, definitions and some concepts developed by ILAE are presented.
