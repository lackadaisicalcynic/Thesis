[Attitudes toward aging prevention: results of a focus groups study].  Emerging life extension technologies, as well as some already existing biomedical interventions to prevent ageing-related pathological processes, have significant potential to alleviate the burden of disease in the aging world.
However, promoting these technologies requires research in public opinion and the use of marketing techniques.
We studied social attitudes towards life extension technologies and geroprotective medicine use with 3 focus groups.  The total sample included 18 people with university degrees, 25-70 years old, and living in Moscow (Russia).
The tested messages were obtained in advance by the survey of 30 experts in gerontology.
The focus group participants got most convinced with the messages that aging prevention is a way to live longer and healthier lives.
Despite the concerns of the experts, the idea that aging is a disease convinces considerable share of the informants when the scientific evidences of the connection between aging processes and aging-related health damage are provided.
Research details in general made the human life extension feasibility more convincing.
Introducing new agendas into discussion (pensions, overpopulation, etc.) turned out to be counterproductive due to new counterarguments emerging in the group discussions.
The idea of radical life extension (i.e. reaching lifespan of 200+ years) was perceived skeptically.  Some skepticism was attributed to mistrust and disappointment in the modern healthcare system in general.
Gene therapies were perceived with caution.
The word «geroprotector» is not well known even to the educated general public.
