[A study of the duration of the disease as a risk factor for the development of hospitalization in elderly psychiatric patients.]  Phenomenon of hospitalism in elderly patients with mental disorders is an extremely important clinical, social and economic problem. 155 patients of the gerontopsychiatric hospital were examined, 75 of them showed signs of hospitalism, and 80 made up a control group.
A subgroup of patients with signs and short duration of the disease was isolated, the duration of treatment in the hospital of these patients was 133,5±42,24 days (in the corresponding control subgroup 72,11±37,11 days, p<0,05).
This subgroup was characterized by greater impulsiveness as a personality trait and less adaptive coping strategies.
A subgroup of patients with signs of hospitalism and a longer duration of the disease also had a longer stay in the hospital compared to patients with a similar experience of illness without hospitalism (249,67±63,56 and 79,58±39,52 days, respectively, p<0,05).  For this subgroup of patients, the factors associated with the development of hospitalism were higher anxiety and depression in the current psychoemotional state, a smaller representation of adaptive cognitive coping and less sensitivity to the disease, all differences are significant at p<0,05.
