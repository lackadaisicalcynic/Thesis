[Aortic valve replacement with stentless bioprosthesis].  AIM
To evaluate prospectively the hemodynamic performance of «BioLAB Mono» stentless bioprosthesis implanted into aortic position.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Twenty seven patients (mean age 71 (67; 73); 17 women) with severe aortic stenosis underwent aortic valve replacement with «BioLAB Mono» stentless bioprosthesis from 2012 to 2014.
The valves were implanted into supra-annular position using continuous polypropylene suture.  RESULTS
In the early postoperative period 1 patient (3.7%) died for acute heart failure.
The mean aortic cross-clamping time was 81 (75; 90) min. Echocardiographic peak pressure gradient were 18 (16; 23) mmHg (postoperative).  There were no cases of valve dysfunction in early postoperative period.
Level of thrombocytes recovered after 10 days postoperatively.
CONCLUSION
«BioLAB Mono» aortic bioprosthesis implantation is easy and reproducible.  The valve has excellent hemodynamic performance in early postoperative period.
