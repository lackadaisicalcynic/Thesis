[Alcoholism at the end of 1980-s and beginning of 2010-s].
AIM  To study the 20-years' clinical alteration and alcoholism basing on the changes in its clinical symptoms and course.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 527 alcoholics with formed alcohol withdrawal syndrome: 181 alcoholics were examined in 1988-1990 (Group 1) and 346 alcoholics in 2011-2012 (Group 2).  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
In Group 1, vodka consumption dominated at all stages of alcoholism.
Group 2 included 172 alcoholics with the domination of vodka consumption and 174 alcoholics with mixed consumption.
It was shown that in comparison with Group 1 (1988-1990 patients) patients from Group 2 (2011-2012) had slower and mild development of alcoholism, especially those in the mixed consumption group.
The authors suggest that the change of the clinical pattern in Group 2 was due to the change in the composition of consumed alcoholic beverages.
