AIM  Comparative morphologic assessment of the liver tissue response to the preoperative infusion of octreotide and prednisolon after the major hepatic resection was studied in rats.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
25 male Wistar rats weighing 230--280 g were used.  All rats underwent 70--80% hepatectomy.
The rats were divided into three groups according to the infusions before hepatectomy: group 1 (n=7) -- received octreotide, group 2 (n=8) -- prednisolone, group 3 (n=10) -- 0.9% saline solution as the control.
Histologic features of the remnant liver were evaluated in the sacrificied rats after 72 hours post-hepatectomy.
RESULTS
In the group 1 we observed more rapid decrease of edema and tendency to the accelerated regeneration process of hepatocytes.
CONCLUSION
Octreotide infusion before the major hepatic resection may have protective effect on hepatocytes and accelerate the regeneration in the remnant liver.
