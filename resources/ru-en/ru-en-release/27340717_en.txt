[Cancer stem cell markers and their prognostic value].  Based on an analysis of a large number of sources of literature, the paper gives general information on the markers for cancer stem cells (CSCs), which allow the detection of this rare cell subpopulation, on the possibilities of estimating their immunohistochemical or immunofluorescent expression in tumors, and on the prognostic and predictive values of these molecules.
For their detection, investigators generally use definite molecules, the so-called markers of CSCs, among which there are CD44, CD133, CD24, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and others.
The expression of these molecules in the tumor tissue obtained from patients affects survival rates and permits the prediction of a response to therapy.
A better insight into the immunophenotype of CSCs, the role of CSC markers in retaining the special properties of this call population, and the clinical significance of the expression of CSC markers will be able to elaborate new approaches to therapy for malignancies.
