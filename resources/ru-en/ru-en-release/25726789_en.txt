[Treatment of asthenic syndrome in patients with chronic brain ischemia: results of the non-interventional observational program TRIUMPH].
OBJECTIVE
To assess the severity of asthenic syndrome (AS) in chronic brain ischemia (CBI) in primary health care settings.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 1170 patients with brain ischemia, aged 45-65 years, treated with phenotropil in dose 100 mg during 2 and 3 months.
Clinical examination and MFI-20 subscales were administered.
RESULTS AND Ð¡ONCLUSION: The high incidence of asthenic syndrome was observed across all MFI-20 subscales.
The decrease in asthenic syndrome severity was significant already in the end of the first month of treatment with phenotropil.
Such dynamics maintained to the end of the second and third month of treatment.
More than 2-fold decrease in the severity of asthenia symptoms was achieved in all subgroups 3 months after treatment.
More rapid and apparent decrease in asthenic syndrome was observed in younger patients.
