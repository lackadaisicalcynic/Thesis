[The differential approach to the surgical treatment of pathologies of the frontal sinus].  The surgical intervention for the management of frontal sinusitis is required in a large fraction of patients presenting with this condition.
The treatment of choice for the pathology in question is endoscopic endonasal frontotomy.
Whenever the endoscopic technique is impossible to employ, the surgeon has to resort to an extranasal operation on the frontal sinus.  The indications for the application of such strategy include the pathological conditions complicated by the intracranial and orbital processes, the presence of large benign tumours, recurrent post-surgical purulent sinusitis and traumatic frontal sinusitis.
For the preservation of the functionally competent frontal sinus during extranasal frontotomy, a frontonasal fistula with all bony walls and maximally spared mucous membrane can be created.
In order to remove an osteotoma from the frontal sinus, we applied the osteoplastic approach with the formation of the osteo-periosteal flap from the frontal wall of the sinus.  In those cases when it was impossible to restore the frontal sinus and there was a closed bone cavity undergoing purulent inflammation we practiced obliteration of the cavity with the use of a porous carbon implant.
