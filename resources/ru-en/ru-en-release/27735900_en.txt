[An experimental study of anticonvulsant effects of myo-inositol and folic acid].
AIM  To study the micronutrients that potentiate the action of anticonvulsant drugs, and in particular, of myo-inositol (vitamin B8).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
An experimental study of neurotrophic and anticonvulsant effects of a preparation based on myo-inositol (inofert) on thiosemicarbazide models of seizures was carried out.
RESULTS
Inofert significantly increased the latent time before the first convulsive seizure, reduced the severity of seizures (p<0.05) and reduced mortality in the models of thiosemicarbazide seizures.
Myo-inositol enhanced anticonvulsant action of gabapentin and sodium valproate; neuroprotective effect of myo-inositol was also confirmed.  CONCLUSION
The Inofert preparation, containing myo-inositol and folic acid, modulates the effects of drugs with both convulsive and anticonvulsive action, reduces the severity and duration of seizures caused by thiosemicarbazide and increases the survival rate of animals.
