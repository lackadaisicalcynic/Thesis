[Training curves for endosurgical interventions in neonates and infants].
AIM  To demonstrate training curves for endosurgical interventions in neonates and infants.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was analyzed duration of thoracoscopic reconstruction of esophageal atresia (31 patients) and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (61 patients) performed for the period from January 2005 to December 2012.
Graphs and tables reflecting correlation between duration and number of operations were framed.
RESULTS
Figures demonstrate reducing duration of surgery with increase of endosurgical interventions number.
CONCLUSION
Our data revealed that time necessary for minimally invasive procedures in infants and neonates decreases in process of experience accumulation.
