[Clinical and morphological characteristics of gastrointestinal stromal tumors].  Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract.
Despite this, GISTS comprise about 2% in the structure of digestive tract cancers.
They are usually localized in the stomach; however, they can be found in the small intestine and more rarely in the colon and esophagus.
Although approximately 70% of the GISTs consist predominantly of spindle cells; the epithelioid cell tumors represent 20% of cases; there are also mixed variants.
This variability in the morphological structure of GISTs complicates their diagnosis.
