[Diagnosis and immediate results of treatment of patients with non-epithelial tumors of upper gastrointestinal tract].  We presented an experience of treatment of 225 patients with non-epithelial tumors of upper gastrointestinal tract.
Complicated disease's course was observed in 24% of cases.  Tactical approaches are discussed depending on localization, dimensions and nature of tumor growth.
Also indications for minimally invasive operations are defined.
It was operated 102 (45.3%) of above-mentioned patients.  Conventional surgical interventions were performed in 49 (48.0%) cases, laparoscopic operations - in 11 (10.8%) observations, endoscopic techniques using flexible endoscope - in 42 (41.2%) patients.
One hundred and twenty-three (54.7%) patients were under dynamic observation.  Technical features of the performed operations are described in the article.
Complications were diagnosed in 8 patients including intraoperative in 3 cases and postoperative in 5 cases.  Postoperative mortality was 2.0% (2 of 102 died).
Overall mortality was 1.3% (3 of 225 patients died).  Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (38) and leiomyoma (29) were the most frequent findings among removed tumors.
