[Age and gender aspects of the status of lipid profile and stress-realizing systems of the human body in the aging process].
In the course of inspection 1136 persons of different age and sex data on dynamics of the main components of lipid profile, the concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in blood plasma and indicators of levels of free cortisol, melatonin sulfate, metanephrine and normetanephrine in urine daily were obtained.
Clear age and gender differences related both to the content of atherogenic fractions of lipids in the blood, and types of dyslipidemia were revealed.  Fundamental differences in the age dynamics of indicators of stress-realizing systems in men and women and the correlation of these indicators with the level of low density lipoproteins and atherogenic coefficient were identified.
The data obtained may indicate different mechanisms of development of atherosclerosis and its associated pathological aging in people of different sex and age, which enables the practical use of research results for the earliest diagnosis and prognosis of a number of associated with age and pathological conditions.
