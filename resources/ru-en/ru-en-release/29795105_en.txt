[Anatomic rationale for clinical efficacy of intraosseous mental nerve anesthesia].  The aim of the study was to prove the anatomical and clinical effectiveness of the modified anesthesia of mental nerve.
The effectiveness of conductive anesthesia near the mental foramen was objectively evaluated using the electric pulp test (EPT) in 100 volunteers of both sexes, aged 35-43 years.
Wet anterior mandible preparations obtained from 350 cadavers aged 18-74 years were also studied.
EPT value after local mental anesthesia conducted according to Malamed C. using 4% articain solution of local anesthetic with vasoconstrictor concentration of 1:200.000 after 2 minutes was 93±0.82 mA, after 4 minutes - 188±1.26 mA. Yield variability indicators of intraosseous mental nerve anesthesia was slightly higher varying from 94.11 mA to 96.61 mA after 2 minutes and from 197.4 to 199.92 mA after 4 minutes survey.
The study showed the efficiency and predictability of intraosseous anesthesia of the mental nerve.
