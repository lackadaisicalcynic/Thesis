[In-hospital and long-term results of delayed percutaneous coronary intervention after successful thrombolytic therapy in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction.]  The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction after thrombolytic reperfusion with indirect reperfusion signs.
A total of 96 patients aged 75 years and over with acute myocardial infarction and successful thrombolysis (reduction of ST segment elevation 90 min after thrombolysis) were included in this study.  Thirty patients (31%) were selected for delayed PCI.
Stent implantation was performed in 70% of cases (21 patients).  The bleeding rates did not differ between groups of delayed PCI and conservative therapy.
The rates of recurrent myocardial infarction (ReMI) and lethality did not differ between groups of delayed PCI and conservative therapy.  The rates of ReMI after discharge from hospital and the lethality rates within one year did not differ.
Then, the patients were assigned to two groups: stented group (n=21) and non-stented group (n=75).  The ReMI and lethality rates did not differ between these groups in-hospitally and within one year, but the rate of composite outcome (ReMI + lethality) within one year was lower in stented group: 33,3% vs 41,3% (p=0,039).
