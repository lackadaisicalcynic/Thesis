[Psychopathological features of chronic apathetic depressions in schizophrenia].
OBJECTIVE
To study the features of apathetic phenomena developed in chronic depressions in patients with attack-like schizophrenia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Psychopathological features of chronic apathetic depressions in schizophrenia (19 patients) were compared to attack-like depressions in affective disorders (n=25) and schizophrenia with distinct apathetic depressions (n=17).  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Clinical features of the main cases and their differences from comparison groups have been identified.  The influence of endogenous progressive disease on clinical and dynamic features of chronic apathetic depressions is discussed.
