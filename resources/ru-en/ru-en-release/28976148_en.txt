[Effect of peptide geroprotectors on the navigation system learning and caspase-3 in brain structures in rats of different age].
The study of the effects of peptide geroprotectors cortexin and pinealon on the system of caspase-3 in the brain structures and training of rats of different ages was held.  Regional changes in activity and the content of caspase-3 in the cerebral cortex and brainstem of young and old rats under the influence of peptides were identified.
It is suggested that the functional state of caspase-3 in the brain is one of the reasons that determines the animals' ability to learn.  Pinealon has prevalent positive effect on learning of both young and old animals in the Morris labyrinth compared to cortexin.
