[Simultaneous operation in a patient with stenosis of the extracranial portion and an intracranial aneurysm of the internal carotid artery].  Presented herein is a clinical case report concerning surgical treatment of a patient with a rare combination of two pathologies, i. e., a haemodynamically significant stenosis of the extracranial portion and a sacciform aneurysm of the communicative portion of the right internal carotid artery on the background of multifocal atherosclerosis.
The patient underwent a simultaneous operation consisting in clipping of the sacciform arterial aneurysm of the communicative portion of the right internal carotid artery and carotid endarterectomy on the right.
The chosen surgical policy ensured effective prevention of the development of ischaemic stroke and rupture of the arterial aneurysm, whose risks would have been high in staged treatment and sequentially performing two operations.
