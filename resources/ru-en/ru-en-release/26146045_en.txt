[Experience of using neuroendoscopy in treatment of noncommunicating hydrocephalus in infants].
320 children were operated on for occlusive hydrocephalus for 10 years (2003-2012).
Infant patients amounted to 93.4%, of these newborns were 29.2%.  An endoscopic technique was used to restore physiological liquor circulation and compensate for hydrocephalus without shunt implantation.
The positive outcome was observed in 75% of cases.
Occlusion of the subarachnoid space occurred in the other cases, which required a combination of neuroendoscopic intervention and shunt implantation.
There were no complications and mortality associated with an operative trauma.
