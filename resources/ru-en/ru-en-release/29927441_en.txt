[Scleromyxedema as a systemic disease of glycosaminoglycan accumulation].  Scleromyxedema is a rare mucinosis with a primary skin lesion due to diffuse mucin deposition, sclerosis, and lichenoid eruptions in the absence of hypothyroidism.
The paper describes scleromyxedema cases and gives recommendations for the histological diagnosis of the disease by histochemical reactions to detect acid and neutral glycosaminoglycans.
