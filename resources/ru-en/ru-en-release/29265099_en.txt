[Efficacy, safety and tolerability of glatiramer acetate injections in dose 40 mg/ml in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis].  The article presents the results of an international study on the efficacy and safety of glatiramer acetate (GA) (40 mg/ml administered 3 times a week) compared with placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
This study was conducted in 142 sites in 17 countries including Russia.
In total, the study included 1404 patients with RRMS including 166 patients from Russia.  Glatiramer acetate (40 mg/ml 3 times a week) demonstrated the high efficacy, safety and tolerability profile.
In conclusion, glatiramer acetate GA in dose 40 mg/ml should be considered as a more convenient regimen for RRMS patients which can improve patients' adherence to treatment and as a result, its efficacy.
