[A giant hyperostotic parasagittal meningioma in a child with neurofibromatosis type II (a case report and literature review)].  Large parasagittal meningiomas, in particular hyperostotic ones, in children are rare and problematic in the differential diagnosis.
The literature reports only single clinical cases related to this issue; opinions about the indications, surgical treatment options, and prognosis are contradictory.
This paper presents a clinical case of a hyperostotic parasagittal meningioma with intra-extracranial growth in a 10-year-old boy with neurofibromatosis type II significantly worsening the prognosis.
We discuss the epidemiological and clinical features of childhood meningiomas and issues of their diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.
