[Determination of the barrel inclination of the AK-74 assault rifle from the specific features of soot deposition after a shot around the inlet wounds caused by a burst of shots].  The specific features of soot deposition after a shot fired from the Kalashnikov AK-74 assault rifle are determined by the influence of the multiple factors, with the effect of the muzzle brake (MB) designed to enhance fire density and decrease the fire recoil energy being prevalent over other factors.
The special windows, slots and holes in the muzzle brake mechanism are responsible for the appearance of the specific topographic features of soot deposition formed by the combustion gases passing through the assembly.
Apart from the characteristic butterfly-shaped soot deposition patterns that appear due to the presence of two windows in the muzzle brake assembly, the additional zones of soot deposition can sometimes be seen on the objects and targets due to the escape of the combustion gases through the MB compensator openings.
This phenomenon enables a forensic medical expert to determine orientation and position of the AK-74 rifle with respect to the shooting target.
This article reports the results of the forensic medical expertise of a serviceman who died from the injuries to the head inflicted by a burst of shots fired from the Kalashnikov AK-74 assault rifle.
The direction of the wound canals and their topographic patterns (including the shape, size, number, and localization) of soot deposition around the inlet wounds made it possible to determine the position of the AK-12 rifle with respect to the affected regions of the head and thereby to prove that the death of the serviceman was a result of suicide.
