[Giant chondroblastoma of the femur].  Chondroblastoma is a benign cartilaginous bone tumor.
The large dimension and aggressive local spread of the tumor may create a diagnostic problem.
A 24 x 17 x 15-cm chondroblastoma is described in a 50 year-old woman.
The tumor of typical structure was located in the upper femur, growing into soft tissues and pelvic bones.
Thirteen months following interilioabdominal exarticulation, the patient was found to have neither local recurrence nor distant metastases.
