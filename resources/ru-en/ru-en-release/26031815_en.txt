[Clinical and ultrasonic predictors of postoperative complications after carotid endarterectomy].  For the period from 2007 to 2012 carotid endarterectomy was performed in 150 patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency I-IV degrees and atherosclerotic lesion of carotid arteries.
Dynamic observation was performed by using of duplex scanning of brachiocephalic arteries, transcranial duplex scanning, multislice CT with contrast study of extracranial and intracranial arteries.  Different degrees of vascular wall thickening of operated internal carotid artery including neo- and myointimal hyperplasia, restenosis and other complications were observed in 19 (12.6%) patients after carotid endarterectomy on background of cerebrovascular insufficiency progressing.
It was revealed that transient ischemic attack or stroke, acute heart failure in early postoperative period, arterial hypertension with crisis course predominantly, diabetes mellitus 2 type, obesity, male sex, elderly age and smoking were clinical markers for complications after carotid endarterectomy.
Ultrasonic markers of complications after carotid endarterectomy included terms of development and degree of vascular wall thickening in case of neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis, hyperperfusion syndrome and stroke, significant changes of blood flow velocity and indexes of peripheral vascular resistance.
