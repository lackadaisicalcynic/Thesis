[The application of digital video-otoscopy for diagnostics of various forms of otitis in the children].  Digital video-otoscopy (DVO) is one of the modern high-tech methods for otiatric diagnostics that allows to enlarge the image of the area being examined, i.e. the otoscopic picture.
DVO has been shown to facilitate the objective dynamic observation of the clinical course of the disease by means of photo- and videodocumentation of he changes in the tympanic membrane and other otoscopicstructures.
The DVO technique makes it possible to substantially improve the quality of diagnostics, detect the middle ear conditions at the early stagesof their alteration, and choose the optimal strategy for the continued conservative and/or surgical treatment.
