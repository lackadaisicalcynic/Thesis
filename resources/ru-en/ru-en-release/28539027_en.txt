[Clinical and neurologic characteristic and principles of therapy of late-onset Myasthenia gravis].  In the present work the results of the clinic-epidemiological analysis of 223 patients with the onset of the myasthenia at 60 y. o. and later, admitted and treated in the clinic of neurology for the passed 25years are represented.
A dynamic growth of incidence of the late-onset myasthenia through the passed 10 years was administered.
We administered a prevalence of the generalized form of the myasthenia gravis
(61,5 %). The whole clinical table of the myasthenia was developed during an year in 76,7 % of the cases.
A wide range of the concomitant somatic pathology in this group of the patients
(especially, with a cardio-vascular pathology - 93,3 %) was found to worsen the course of the myasthenia itself.
We found that the set of the therapeutic measures in myasthenia in the elderly is determined by the course of the myasthenia and the multiple organ failure due to the concomitant diseases.
The scheme of complex corrective therapy of myasthenia gravis in elderly was developed.
