[The efficacy of prevention of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in cardiac surgeries with the use of the cerebrolysin].
AIM
To assess the efficacy of postoperative cytoprotection with cerebrolysin in cardiac surgeries without using cardiopulmonary bypass and to analyze the changes in the blood circulation in the postoperative period in groups with- and without cerebrolysin preconditioning.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-eight patients, who underwent coronary and mammaro-coronary bypass grafting without using cardiopulmonary bypass, were included in the study.  Fifteen patients received cerebrolysin before surgery.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Cerebrolysin improved cognitive test scores.
Positive changes on anxiety and depression scales were observed as well.  In the group of patients treated with cerebrolysin, quantitative parameters of the cerebral blood flow were in stable condition, with a slight increase on the 10th day after surgery, which may indicate increasing stress resistance of cells of the central nervous system after appropriate pharmacological protection.
