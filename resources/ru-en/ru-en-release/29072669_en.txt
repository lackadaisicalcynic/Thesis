[Epithelial dysfunction associated with pyo-inflammatory diseases of the ENT organs].  The modern concept of epithelial-endothelial dysfunction and epithelial-endothelial distress-syndrome associated with pyo-inflammatory ENT diseases is presented.
It has provided a basis for the analysis of the initial stages of etiopathogenesis of acute and chronic inflammation in the ENT system including the mucous and associated lymphoid tissues as well as the Pirogov-Waldeyer limphopharyngeal ring making up the first protective barrier.
The leading role of dysbiosis of synanthropic microflora and endotoxins of the Gram-negative bacteria in the mechanisms of regional responsiveness of the organism to the infection and chronic endotoxic aggression is demonstrated.
The regional and synthetic mechanisms underlying the interaction between the external and internal media of the organism are subjected to the analysis with special reference to those operating in epithelium.
The possible variants of the outcome of these processes are considered including both the recovery and the development of chronic inflammation.
It has been proved that the exhaustion of the internal reserves for the stabilization of the epithelium-associated lymphoid tissue system including the Pirogov-Waldeyer limphopharyngeal ring leads to the formation of epithelial dysfunction as the initial stage of epithelial-endothelial dysfunction and epithelial-endothelial distress-syndrome.
It is concluded that the modern concept of epithelial-endothelial dysfunction and epithelial-endothelial distress-syndrome is a fundamental interdisciplinary phenomenon.
