[Monitoring of neurotrophic factors and cognitive function in patients with traumatic brain injury].
AIM
To study the neurological and cognitive status in comparison to the quantitative content of blood serum neurotrophic factors of patients with acute and long-term brain injury during treatment with cerebrolysin.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty patients, 56 men and 24 women, aged from 18 to 64 years, were examined in acute and long-term periods of the brain injury of moderate severity.  An open, comparative, randomized study was performed before and after treatment with cerebrolysin.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Cognitive impairment, dysregulation type in the acute and long-term brain injury of mild to moderate severity was associated with the low content of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
These disorders were clinically more pronounced in patients with the damage of the frontal and temporal lobes.
After treatment with cerebrolysin, a significant positive dynamics on the scale of frontal dysfunction and increased levels of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor were identified.
