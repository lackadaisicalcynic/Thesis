Treatment of vertebrobasilar insufficiency due to stenosis and aneurysm of the vertebral artery.  A dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery in the extracranial portion is a rare pathology.
It may either have a symptom-free course or induce a clinical picture of vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
To the main methods of surgical treatment belong endovascular techniques and resection of an aneurysm with shunting of the V3 segment of the vertebral artery.
Presented in the article is a clinical case report regarding successful surgical management of a dissecting aneurysm of the extracranial portion in a young woman presenting with a clinical course of vertebrobasilar insufficiency and treated by means of ligation of the vertebral artery in the V1 segment and autovenous shunting from the external carotid artery to the V3 segment of the vertebral artery.
