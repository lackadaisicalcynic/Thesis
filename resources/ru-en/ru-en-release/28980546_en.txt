[The possibility of using the synthetic compound for the purpose of modeling of the human soft tissues in connection with the evaluation of gunshot damages].
The necessity of using a simulator of human soft tissues for the purpose of criminalistic and forensic medical expertises is dictated by the requirements put forward by the expert practice.
The objective of the present study was to develop a synthetic simulator of the human soft tissues (compound) to ensure reliability of comparative criminalistics and forensic medical studies for the evaluation of gunshot injuries.  The synthetic compound was prepared by mixing up the petroleum and/or synthetic oil with a polymeric thickening agent.
This procedure was followed by heating the mixture at 90 degrees Celsius during 5 hours.  Thereafter, petrolatum and/or ceresin and/or paraffin were added to the mixture.
At the final stage, ionol was introduced, and the mixture was poured into a mold measuring 70×70×210 mm with its subsequent cooling down to 40 degrees Celsius during 10-12 hours.  The experimental shooting was effected from the Kalashnikov AKS-74U assault rifle using the 5.45×39 mm (7H6) cartridges, Makarov pistol using the 9×18 mm cartridges and Nagant pistol using the CHELP-1000 cartridges.
Five shots were fired from each of the three models.  The experimental gunshot damages were evaluated visually by examining the inlet and exit openings and the bullet channel.
In addition, criminalistic analysis of the grooves in cartridges was carried out.  The technology for the fabrication of synthetic compounds based on ethylene, propylene, and butadiene co-polymers in the combination with such low molecular weight compounds as paraffins and ceresins having a homogeneous structure makes it possible to vary the rheological and mechanical properties of the simulators of human soft tissues for the solution of diagnostic and identification problems in the framework of criminalistics and forensic medical expertises.
