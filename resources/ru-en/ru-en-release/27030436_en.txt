[Effectiveness of femtosecond laser assistance in complicated cataracts].  AIM  to perform comparative evaluation of intra- and postoperative clinical RESULTS in patients with complicated cataracts (grade I-II lens subluxation, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or surgically treated glaucoma) undergoing either standard or femtosecond laser-assisted phacoemulsification.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 197 patients (245 eyes) aged 32-85 years (58.5 years on average) with complicated cataracts were divided into two groups by the technique used for phacoemulsification.
Group 1 (main group, 120 eyes of 105 patients) underwent femtosecond laser-assisted phacoemulsification.
Group 2 (controls, 125 eyes of 92 patients) received standard procedures.
Subjective and objective measures of ocular structure and function were evaluated in 1, 3, and 7 days and 1 month after the surgery.
RESULTS
In the femtosecond laser-assisted group, all lenses were well-centered in the capsular bag as documented by ultrasound biomicroscopy.
During the whole follow-up period the studied parameters were stable.
No dislocations occurred.
In group 2 (standard phaco), all parameters demonstrated high changeability over the follow-up period.  CONCLUSION
The improved technique of femtosecond laser-assisted phacoemulsification offers many advantages to surgical management of complicated cataracts.
Not only does it allow to reduce ultrasound time, but also to perform precise capsulorhexis with preset parameters, decrease intra- and postoperative complications rates, and improve refraction outcomes in such patients.
