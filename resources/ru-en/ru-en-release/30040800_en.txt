[Procognitive effects of fluvoxamine: preliminary data].
AIM  To identify and investigate procognitive effects of fluvoxamine.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A prospective non-comparative trial of fluvoxamine was carried out in 50 patients in the remission phase of recurrent depressive disorder.
To assess the efficacy of therapy, the Stroop color and word test, the Revised version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, the Frontal Assessment Battery, the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale were used.  Fluvoxamine was administered at doses of 50-150 mg/day for 24-weeks.
There were the improvement of executive functions, including selective attention and inhibitory control, and recovery of verbal fluency.  The procognitive effect of fluvoxamine was dose-dependent and was related to the reduction of residual depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSION
Fluvoxamine has procognitive effects, stabilizes remission and improves social adaptation of the patients.
