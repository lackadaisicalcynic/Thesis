[Review of surgical treatment of insular gliomas: challenges and opportunities].  Intracerebral tumors of the insular lobe are quite frequent, however treatment of patients with this pathology still remains a challenging and controversial issue of neurosurgery.
First of all, this is associated with the localization of tumors in the area of eloquent anatomical structures: M1--M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery, lenticulostriate arteries, basal ganglia, and internal capsule, which causes a high rate of postoperative complications in these patients.  Most insular tumors are amenable for resection with a reasonable rate of postoperative complications, although most of the surgery-related complications resulting in substantial deficits are due to lesions of eloquent anatomical structures located in this compact anatomical space.
Therefore, the aim of this work was to analyze the literature regarding the issues of clinical presentation, diagnosis, and aspects of surgical treatment of insular tumors.
