[The morphological changes of Hassall corpuscles of the different maturity in vertebrate animals and human in different stages of age].  With the use of methods of light microscopy we produce comparison morphological investigation of Hassall corpuscles of different maturity in animals and human with age difference.
It was arranged that quantity and sizes of Hassall corpuscles in different stages of age depend on organization level, belonging to a vital form, shape and age of animal.
On the base of our investigation we can make resume about functional role of Hassall corpuscles.
