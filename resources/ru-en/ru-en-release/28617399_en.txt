[Specific age-related and gender related features in oral status].  The aim of the study was to assess age and gender related features of oral status and oral hygiene.
The study included 234 patients (76 males and 158 females) aged 25 to 74 years.
It is proved that females have more dental appointments than males mostly because of specific oral conditions associated with pregnancy and menopause as well as better compliance with prevention programs.
Thus, females require more intense follow-up than males which should be taken into consideration in treatment and follow-up plans.
