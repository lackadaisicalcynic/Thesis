[The impact of surgical and conservative treatment of periodontal disease on structural and functional condition of major blood vessels].  The study included 55 patients (24 men and 31 women aged 30-70 years) with chronic periodontal disease and atherosclerosis of brachiocephalic arteries (BCA).
Patients in group 1 received only conservative treatment for periodontal disease, while in group 2 both conservative and surgical treatment were performed.
The values were evaluated at baseline and 6 months after treatment.
Capillaroscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry showed an improvement in periodontal regional vascular network.
The level of IL-6 decreased by 3.7 pg/ml and 5.9 pg/ml, C-reactive protein - by 2.0 mg/l and 3.4 mg/l in groups 1 and 2 correspondingly.
Dark-field microscopy showed the decrease in the thickness of perfused boundary region by 0.05 mm and 0.28 mm, and the increase of red blood cells filling by 1.2% and 7.8% correspondingly.
According to the results of ultrasound scanning of BCA after 6 months the number of atherosclerotic plaques and lumen of the vessels in the area of the plaques has not changed.
BCA tone has not changed in group 1 and increased by 1-2% in group 2.
Intima-media complex thickness decreased in group 1 by 0.02-0.03 mm, in group 2 - by 0.04 mm.  The obtained data prove correlation of vascular status of periodontal and major blood vessels.
