To develop a technique of physical rehabilitation of stroke based on the gradual increase of motor/cognitive loading using biofeedback to supporting reaction based on stabilometry with a focus on the changes in peripheral afferentation with the help of an axial loading suit and simple non-apparatus vestibular and respiratory exercises.  The efficacy of standard scheme of restorative treatment and a new technique of optimized complex rehabilitative treatment of acute ischemic stroke in the vertebral-basilar system was compared.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 28 patients with acute stroke in the vertebrobasilar area manifesting with dizziness, disturbances of equilibrium and stability.
The patients were randomized into two equal groups (n=14).  In the main group, a new technique was added to standard treatment.
In the control group, traditional pharmacological and physical treatment was used.  We administered clinical scales and instrumental stabilometric assessment as well.
RESULTS
A significant improvement of the vertical stability assessed with clinical scales (Bohannon, Perry, Stolyarova, Berg Balance Scale) and stabilometric parameters (the Romberg's test) was shown in the main group compared to the control one.
CONCLUSION
The new technique expands the potentials of rehabilitation in the acute stage of stroke and allows to prepare the patient to independent gait.
