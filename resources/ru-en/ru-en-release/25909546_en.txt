[Immediate and remote results of endovascular treatment of patients with postinfarction cardiosclerosis].
Two approaches in treatment of 131 patients with postinfarction cardiosclerosis are compared in the work.  Tactics of "total" myocardial revascularization means restoration of coronary blood flow in all arteries with hemodynamically significant lesion while "selective" revascularization provides restoration of coronary blood flow only in those arteries which have a viable myocardium in their pool.
It was concluded that restoration of coronary blood flow in patients after myocardial infarction permits to prevent postinfarction heart remodeling, development of heart failure thereby affecting on the prognosis.  Evaluation of myocardial viability in the area of suggested surgery increases efficiency of revascularization, reduces number of implantable stents and decreases frequency of unfounded coronary interventions.
Elimination of ischemia in the area of hibernation provides a rapid restoration of myocardial contractility in most of left ventricle segments with initially impaired kinetics.  It was revealed that terms of contractility restoration of hibernating myocardium depend on duration of hibernation period up to revascularization.
