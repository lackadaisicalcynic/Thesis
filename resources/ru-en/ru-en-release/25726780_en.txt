[Test scores as indicators of treatment efficacy in dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice].
OBJECTIVE
To analyze the possibility of using MMSE and CGIS as well as the Clock drawing test for the objectification of treatment efficacy in Alzheimer's disease (AD).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 765 patients with mild and moderate dementia treated with donepezil during 3 months.
The efficacy was assessed using the MMSE and CGIS.
