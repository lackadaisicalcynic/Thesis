[Improvement of the efficacy and safety of the treatment of patients with low back pain].  Low back pain (LBP) is an extremely widespread syndrome in the population.
Nonsteroidal Inflammatory drugs are most frequently used in treatment of patients with LBP.  The use of these drugs causes adverse effects, the risk of which can be minimized.
To decrease the risk, B-group vitamins are used in the complex treatment.  The possibility of simultaneous using of artrozan (meloxicam) and cyanocobalamine (B-group vitamin complex) in the treatment of LBP is considered.
