[Interferon-induced depression and peripheral blood serotonin in patients with multiple sclerosis].
AIM  To study the dynamics of anxiety-depressive disorders and peripheral blood serotonin in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) during interferon-ß (IFN-ß) therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The level of anxiety and depression in 227 MS patients was measured by psychometric testing at baseline and during treatment.  The concentration of serotonin in serum of patients was determined by enzyme immunoassay.
RESULTS  The presence of emotional disorders in patients with MS was confirmed.
Their relationship with personality characteristics of the patient, the course of the disease and social status was shown.
The level of humoral serotonin was lower in patients with MS.  The relationship between the serotonergic system deficiency in patients with MS and anxiety disorders was shown.
Interferon-induced depression was not associated with serotonin metabolism.
It is a multifactor condition influenced by the patient's initial emotional level, personality characteristics, psychological reaction to therapy and the unfavorable dynamics of the disease.
CONCLUSION
IFN-β does not appear to induce depression in MS patients.
