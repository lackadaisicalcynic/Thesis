[Endovascular interventions in treatment of patients with acute impairment of mesenteric blood circulation].  The authors share herein their experience of treating a total of eight patients with acute impairment of mesenteric blood circulation, describing both technical and instrumental peculiarities of interventions on the superior mesenteric artery.
Technical success defined as restoration of the main blood flow through the superior mesenteric artery was achieved in seven (87.5%) patients.
Of these, two (25%) patients required laparotomy and intestinal resection, with the scope of resection being significantly reduced in one case after endovascular thrombectomy.
A further two (25%) patients developed respiratory distress syndrome as a complication of reperfusion syndrome.
There were two (25%) lethal outcomes.
A conclusion was drawn that endovascular interventions might be regarded as an independent method of treatment of patients presenting with acute impairment of the mesenteric blood flow in the stage of intestinal ischaemia.
Besides, this technique makes it possible in case of the development of intestinal gangrene to dramatically diminish the scope of intestinal necrotic lesion.
