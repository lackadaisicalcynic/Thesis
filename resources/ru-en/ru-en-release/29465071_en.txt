The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of laser singlet phototherapy and traditional photodynamic therapy the treatment of periodontal diseases in an animal model.  The experimental model involved 70 male rats Wistar in which periodontitis was modeled and treated: in group I (30 animals) a nanosecond laser device for medical use with a wavelength of 1270 nm was used for 7 sessions in a 400 ns pulse mode, an average radiation power of 2 W, and a radiation density of 200 J/cm2, group II (30 animals) received photodynamic therapy with the administration of a photosensitizer, followed by irradiation with a laser wavelength of 660 nm for 7 sessions 2 Wt average radiation power, group III (controls, 10 animals) - traditional drug therapy.
Morphological studies were performed on 7, 14 and 21 day after treatment.  On day 7th and 14th the study revealed In group I the presence of full blood vessels and diffuse expressed leukocyte infiltration with an admixture of macrophages, in group II - pronounced edema of the tissue and vasoconstriction.
On day 21 the picture included in group I regenerated periodontal ligament with dilated full blood vessels on the border with the bone beams of the alveolar bone, in group II a moderately pronounced edema of the periodontal ligament with single dilated vessels, in controls significantly destroyed periodontal ligament substituted with granulation tissue and periodontal ligament.
Thus, the treatment of periodontitis with the methods of singlet phototherapy leads to the development of reactive inflammation and significant vascularization of periodontal tissues which contributes to the rapid regeneration and stability of remission.
