[The peculiar features of the psychosomatic status in the patients presenting with the spondylogenic and cochleovestibular disorders].
The objective of the present study was to elucidate the peculiar features of the psychosomatic status in the patients with chronic vertebrogenic and cochleovestibular disorders The psychosomatic status was evaluated in 117 patients at the age from 21 to 65 years presenting with these conditions using the psychometric tests based on the STAI questionnaire (the state-trait anxiety inventory) adapted for the determination of the level of reactive and personal anxiety.
It was shown that the vestibular disorders, tympanophonia, and hearing impairment have a negative influence on the psychogenic status of the patients suffering from cochleovestibulopathy.
As many as 92.3% of the patients were characterized by the high or moderately high level of reactive and personal anxiety.  The depressive conditions of various severity were diagnosed in 29.1% of the patients.
The correction of postural muscular disbalance made it possible to achieve the well apparent reduction of the manifestations of reactive anxiety without prescription of the pharmacotherapeutic treatment and thereby to increase the effectiveness of the management of the patients presenting with the vertebrogenic and cochleovestibular disorders.
