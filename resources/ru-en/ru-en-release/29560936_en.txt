[The use of cytoflavin in the acute period of hemorrhagic stroke].
AIM
To evaluate the efficacy of cytoflavin in the dose of 10 ml/day in the complex therapy in acute period of hemorrhagic stroke.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty patients were examined in the acute period of hemorrhagic stroke (HS).
The NIHSS, the Rivermead Mobility Index, the Rankin scale and the Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living were used.
Patients were divided into 2 groups: the main group included 30 patients who received cytoflavin in addition to basic therapy.
The control group included 30 patients who received basic therapy.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
In the main group, there were a significant decrease in the severity of neurological symptoms assessed with the NIHSS in the 10th day of treatment and a more pronounced improvement in the indicators of functional activity on the Rankin scale and daily life on the Barthel index to the level of 'moderate dependence', while the level of 'pronounced dependence' remained in the control group.
Thus, the probability of favorable outcome was higher in the main group.  Inclusion of cytoflavin in the therapy scheme of patients in the acute period of HS increased the efficacy of treatment.
