[A role of personality and stress in the development of depressive symptoms in students].
AIM
To study a role of personality and stress as a mediator between personality and depression in university first-year students.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty-four students (76.6% female, mean age 18.7Â±1.02 years), including 30 first year- and 34 second-year students, were studied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The first-year students experienced more stress and more frequently had depressive symptoms compared to second-year students.
Neuroticism mainly contributed to depression in the first-year students and extroversion was a protective factor against all depressive symptoms, whereas extraversion and conscientiousness were significant unique predictors for depression in the second-year students.
Neuroticism was strongly associated with somatic symptoms, while consciousness was linked to cognitive-affective symptoms.
The role of stress as a mediator of the relationship between personality and depression was confirmed for consciousness in the first-year students; other personality traits and stress contributed directly to depressive symptoms.
