[Cognitive functions, emotional status, MRI measurements in treatment-naïve middle-aged patients with uncomplicated essential arterial hypertension].
AIM  To study cognitive functions, anxiety and depression levels, 24-hour blood pressure (BP) profile, cerebral blood flow (CBF) perfusion in treatment-naive middle-aged patients with uncomplicated essential arterial hypertension (EAH) depending on the white matter hyperintensities (WMH) burden.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty-one hypertensive patients (mean age 46.2±4.6 years) and 41 healthy volunteers (mean age 50.3±6.7 years) were enrolled to the study.
All subjects underwent brain MRI (MAGNETOM Skyra 3.0T, T1, T2 FSE, T2 FLAIR, T1 MPRAGE, ASL), Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCa), 10-word learning task, verbal fluency test, trail making test, Stroop color and word test, anxiety and depression assessment with Hamilton rating scales, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).
RESULTS
WMH were found in 22 (53.7%) hypertensive patients and in 3 (7.3%) healthy volunteers (p=0.0002).
Hypertensive patients had the significantly lower CBF compared to controls (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION  WMH were identified in treatment-naive middle-aged patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate EAH.  There was an association between WMH and lower CBF in the cortical plate of frontal lobes, SBP variability and worse cognition.
Cerebral hypoperfusion can cause cognitive impairment even in the earliest stages of EAH, which increases due to emotional disorders.
