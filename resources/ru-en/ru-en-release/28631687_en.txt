[Acquired atresia and stenosis of the external acoustic meatus].  Acquired atresia of the external acoustic meatus is a rare pathological condition characterized by obliteration of the medial part of the external acoustic canal by a soft fibrous plug.
The present article presents an overview of a series of cases of acquired atresia and stenosis of the external acoustic meatus with the description of etiology, pathogenesis, and methods for the treatment of this condition.  In the majority of the cases, atresia develops at the final stage of granulation external otitis with or without an accompanying dermatological pathology.
Another common cause of the acquired atresia of the external acoustic meatus is the fracture of the temporal bone as well as extensive ear surgery, radiation therapy and a neoplasm in the auditory passage.
The surgical strategy for the management of the acquired atresia and stenosis of the external acoustic meatus consists, besides the excision of the fibrous plug, of the application of the cutaneous flaps and/or transplants to cover the bare parts of the bone portion of the affected external canal.
In spite of such treatment, the state of the external acoustic canal remains unstable, and a relapse of its atresia and stenosis can not be wholly excluded.
