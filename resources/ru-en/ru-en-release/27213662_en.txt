[Polypous rhinosinusitis in the children].  We present an overview of the modern literature concerningpolypous rhinosinusitis (PRS) in the children.
The information thus derived is compared with the available results of the clinical investigations involving the adults patients with this pathology.
Allergic diseases and mucoviscidosis appear to be the pathological conditions most likely leading to the development of polyps in the nasal cavity.
The patients suffering from rhinosinusitis associated with the disorders of arachidonic acid metabolismare very rarely encountered in the pediatric practice unlike those among the adult population.
Intranasal glucocorticosteroids (INGCS), especially in the form of the mometasonefuroate nasal spray, are considered to be the most promising medications for the treatment of the children presenting with PRS.
However, further clinical studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of this therapeutic modality.
