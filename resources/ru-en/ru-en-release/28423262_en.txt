[sRAGE LEVEL AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH COGNITIVE STATUS OF PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND MIXED VASCULAR-DEGENERATIVE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT].
The differences in level of soluble forms of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) in the blood serum of patients with Alzheimer's disease and mixed vascular-degenerative cognitive impairment were studied. sRAGE in blood serum of the patients with Alzheimer's disease is lower than that in patients with mixed vascular-degenerative cognitive impairments.
Correlation analysis of serum sRAGE level and indicators of cognitive status was performed.  Low level of sRAGE is associated with worse memory that is typical for Alzheimer's neurodegenerative process.
This fact confirms the pathogenetic significance of the studied biomarker.
