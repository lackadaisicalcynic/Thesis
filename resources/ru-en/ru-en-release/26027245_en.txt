[Efficiency and safety of different etoricoxib regimens in patients with axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis].
AIM  To study the clinical and laboratory efficiency and safety of different etoricoxib (ET) regimens in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including ankylosing spondylitis.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Forty patients with high axSpA activity (Bath Ankylosing Disease Activity Index (BASDAI 4) were examined and randomized to 2 groups: 1) 30 patients who received ET 90 mg continuously every day; 2) 10 patients who took the drug in the same dose intermittently 1-3 times weekly.
The activity of axSpA (BASDAI, Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)) was evaluated at baseline, 2 and 12 weeks; adverse events were recorded at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 weeks.
The number of patients who had achieved an ASAS40 response at 2 and 12 weeks were taken into consideration.
RESULTS At 12 weeks, the continuous administration group displayed decreases in BASDAI from 8 to 4, in ASDAS from 3.8 to 2.6, and in hs-CRP levels from 9.5 to 3.9 mg/l; the intermittent administration group exhibited decreases in BASDAI from 7.6 to 6.0, in ASDAS from 3.5 to 3.1, and hs-CRP from 8.8 to 4.5 mg/l (p<0.05).
At this time, an AS40 response was achieved by 22 (73.3%) and 2 (20%) patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.05 for all).
No serious adverse events were recorded.
CONCLUSION
The efficacy of ET given in a daily dose of 90 mg was much higher than that of the drug used thrice or less weekly in the patients with axSpA.
