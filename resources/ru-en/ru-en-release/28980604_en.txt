[The diagnostics and treatment of bilateral paralysis of the larynx].  The objective of the present study was to consider the currently available methods for the diagnostics and treatment of the patients presenting with bilateral paralysis of the larynx of various etiologies.
We undertook the analysis of the publications in the domestic and foreign scientific literature concerning diagnosis and treatment of bilateral paralysis of the larynx.  It was found that despite the existing modern high-tech diagnostic technologies and the variety of surgical methods for the treatment of this condition, the problem of diagnostics, management, and rehabilitation of the patients suffering from bilateral paralysis of the larynx remains a serious challenge for the researchers and clinicians that requires further investigation of this pathology.
For the correct and timely diagnosis of bilateral paralysis of the larynx, the comprehensive evaluation of the functional state of the neuromuscular apparatus of the larynx is necessary.
The key prerequisites for the success of the surgical intervention are its timeliness and the choice of the optimal surgical modalities.
