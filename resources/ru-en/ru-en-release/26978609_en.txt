[Results of circulatory disease detection during prophylactic medical examination of the adult population: the first two years' experience].
AIM  To estimate circulatory diseases (CD) detection rates during prophylactic medical examination of the adult population and to define their association with mortality rates and the spread of risk factors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of the 2013-2014 prophylactic medical examinations for CD in the adult population of the Russian Federation as a whole and its subjects were comparatively analyzed using the data of statistical reports and official medical statistics on morbidity and mortality in the adult population.
RESULTS
The data of official statistical reports on the results of prophylactic medical examinations in 2013 (19.4 million) and 2014 (22.2 million) were analyzed.
In 2013 and 2014, there were 85.9 and 82.7 CD cases per 1000 examinees, respectively.
These years were marked by the detection of 50.0 and 46.2 hypertensive patients, 17.1 and 16.1 coronary heart disease (CHD) cases, and 11.5 and 11.2 cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) ones, respectively.
In 2013 and 2014, most CD cases were caused by hypertension (58.4 and 57%, respectively).
The proportion of CHD was 19.9 and 19.4% and that of CVD was 13.4 and 13.6%, respectively.
CONCLUSION
The analysis carried out could provide evidence for the importance of continuous monitoring of prophylactic medical examination at the level of each specific healthcare facility for primary health care to improve its quality and completeness of diagnostic examination.
The found interregional differences in the detection rate of CD call for detailed analysis and determination of their causes, which will ensure the preventive direction of a medical examination that is inextricably entwined with further active follow-up measures for patients having the identified diseases and a risk for their development.
