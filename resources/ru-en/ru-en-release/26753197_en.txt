[Repeated lung resection in patients with postoperative recurrent tuberculosis in the operated lung].  The literature data of 18 authors about surgical treatment of 1723 patients with recurrent tuberculosis are presented in the article.
Also authors reported their own experience in repeated lung resection in 50 patients.
Intraoperative complications were observed in 7 patients including empyema cavity dissection in 2 cases, scalping lung injury in 2 cases, peristump abscess dissection in 1 case, v. azygas injury in 1 patient and rupture of membranous part of trachea due to swollen cuff of intubation tube in 1 case.
In postoperative period complications developed in 5 patients including early intrapleural bleeding in 1 case, later intrapleural bleeding in 1 case, empyema with bronchial fistula in 1 patient, residual pleural cavity in 1 patient and wound complication in 1 case.
All postoperative complications were eliminated and there was no postoperative mortality.
The authors concluded that although severe patients' condition, technical complexity and higher surgical risk of repeated resections compared with organ-preserving and collapsosurgical interventions satisfactory remote results and high proportion of labour rehabilitation earnestly prove advantages of repeated lung resections for recurrent tuberculosis of operated lung.
