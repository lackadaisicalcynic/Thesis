[The construction of the three-dimensional model of the damaged bone tissue based on its roentgenogram].  The objective of the present work was to develop the method for the visualization of the shape of the bone surface in the region of its traumatic damage based on the results of the analysis of a single X-ray image for the solution of the problems facing forensic medical expertise and traumatology.
The three-dimensional models of the fractures of the long tubular bones constructed with the use of the visualization technique were shown to adequately reproduce the morphological picture of the injury.
It allowed to enhance the potential of the forensic medical analysis and the accuracy of the diagnostic methods employed for the purposes of forensic medical expertise.
