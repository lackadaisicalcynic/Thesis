[Preservative-free betaxolol for POAG patients: evaluation of hypotensive effect and ocular surface safety].  AIM  To evaluate ocular surface changes in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) as well as the hypotensive effect of preservative-free betaxolol eye drops.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 22 patients (42 eyes) aged 55-83 with POAG stage I-II were examined.
All of them were switched from betaxolol b.i.d. to its preservative-free analogue (Xonef BK).
The baseline examination included visual acuity measurement, Morisky-Green test (questionnaire), Norn test, Schirmer's test, lissamine green staining, and ocular tonometry.
The latter was repeated 2 and 4 weeks after the drug had been switched, while the whole complex--2 months after the beginning of the study.
RESULTS
The total tear production in POAG patients under betaxolol therapy was 19.1 ± 10.6 mm.
After the 2 months of preservative-free betaxolol use there were no statistically significant changes in Schirmer's test results (p = 0.248).
Tear film break-up time (Norn test) improved from 7.8 ± 0.5 secto 9.8 ± 0.8 sec (p = 0.067) as well as the results of lissamine green staining (W = 90.0, p < 0.022).
In the Morisky-Green Test betaxolol patients scored only 2.6 ± 0.05 points on average, thus showing non-compliance.
After the 2 months of preservative-free betaxolol instillations the scores increased up to 3.1 ± 0.07 (p = 0.04).
According to Dunnett's test, used for multiple comparisons, intraocular pressure did not change significantly in either of the study periods (baseline and follow-up measurements at weeks 2, 4, and 8 were taken into account).
CONCLUSION
The study proves Xonef BK safe, effective, and appropriate in all types of glaucoma.
