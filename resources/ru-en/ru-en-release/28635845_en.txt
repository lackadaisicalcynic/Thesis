[Neurosurgery in a patient on dual antiplatelet therapy.  Case report and the review of the literature].
INTRODUCTION
A neurosurgical intervention in a patient on dual antiplatelet therapy is a serious challenge for both the neurosurgeon and anesthesiologist..
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The article describes a clinical case of a successful urgent neurosurgical intervention (ventriculoperitoneostomy for obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a large meningioma of the posterior surface of the petrous pyramid) in a patient on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) due to a recently placed coronary stent..
CONCLUSION  Given a high risk of coronary stent thrombosis, the surgery was performed in the presence of ongoing DAT.
There were no intracranial hemorrhagic complications, but subcutaneous hemorrhagic complications developed.  The article discusses the features of managing similar patients whose number is growing.
