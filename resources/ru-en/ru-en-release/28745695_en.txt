[MicroRNAs in chronic glomerulonephritis: Promising biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis estimation].  The review presents the results of recent experimental and clinical studies of the expression pattern of a number of miRNAs, a recently described new class of noncoding RNAS that are able to regulate the posttranscriptional expression of genes and thus to modulate several physiological and pathological processes in different morphological types of chronic glomerulonephritis.
It considers the possibilities of using miRNAs as new biomarkers to diagnose the disease, to predict its course and a response to therapy.
