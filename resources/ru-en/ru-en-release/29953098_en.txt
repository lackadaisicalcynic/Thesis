PURPOSE  Show the possibility of an alternative use of interventional radiology techniques in complex treatment of patients with inflammatory complications of the diverticular disease of the colon.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In 2012-2016, there were 87 patients under our supervision with complicated diverticular disease.
In 57 (65.5%) cases were diagnosed infiltrate, in 24 (27.6%) cases - abscess of paracolon area (Ib-II type by Hinchey), in 6 (6.9%) cases (III-IV type according Hinchey) generalized peritonitis have been identified.
RESULTS  Emergency laparotomy was performed in 13 patients.
Abscesses of paracolon (Ib-II type by Hinchey) area were diagnosed sonographically during the initial examination in 17 patients.
26 percutaneous drainage of diverticulogenous abscesses of different localizations self-locking drainage #8Fr 'pig tail' was carried out under the combined ultrasonic and X-ray control in this group of patients.  The technical success of percutaneous drainaging of the abscesses was achieved in all manipulations.
13 patients had a single drainaging, and for diverticular disease - disease-free during the observation period of 1 year to 5 years.
Resection of the colon in a planned manner after percutaneous drainage of recurrent abscess of paracolon area was performed in 4 patients.
Complications related with the technique of installing drainage were not reported, mortality in the group of drained patients was absent.  CONCLUSION
Ultrasound examination of patients with suspected inflammatory complications of diverticular disease - a necessary and sufficient method for initial diagnosis of the disease.
Percutaneous drainage of diverticulogenous abscesses (Hinchey Ib-II) is represented by the pragmatic 'first line' choice in patients with complicated diverticular disease, that allows to treat the pathology steadfastly in most of the cases.
