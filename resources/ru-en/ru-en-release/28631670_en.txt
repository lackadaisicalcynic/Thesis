[Topographic anatomy of the hook region and its significance for the choice of the surgical technique for the cochlear implantation].  The mode of the introduction of the active electrode of a cochlear implant into the cochlea remains a key issue as far as cochlear implantation is concerned.
Especially much attention has recently been given to the relationship between the anatomical features of the basal region of the cochlea (the so-called 'fish hook') and the possibility to approach it.
We have undertaken the attempt to optimize the approach to the tympanic canal (scala tympanica) of the cochlea with a view to reducing to a minimum the risk of an injury to the cochlear structures in the course of cochlear implantation.
A total of 35 cadaveric temporal bones were examined to measure the fine structures of the hook region and evaluate the risk of their damages associated with various approaches to the tympanic canal.
