[Clinical results of basal meningiomas surgery with the neodymium laser].
OBJECTIVE
to assess the efficacy of developed laser technologies of basal meningioma resection.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors analyzed the results of surgical treatment of 83 people, who underwent basal meningioma surgery in 1995-2008, in remote postoperative period.  Follow-up and analysis of the dynamics of patient's quality-of-life, neurological deficit, frequency of relapses and continued growth of tumors were studied in 51 patients operated using neodymium laser and 32 patients after standard surgery.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The use of the neodymium laser in basal meningioma resection significantly increased the efficacy of surgery, reduced the risk of recurrent tumors and improved quality-of-life of patients in remote postoperative period.
