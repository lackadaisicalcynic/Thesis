[A clinical case of hemangioma of the face and tongue concurrent with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome complicated by cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disturbances].  The paper describes a clinical case of a female patient with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in the presence of congenital hemangioma of the face, soft palate, and tongue concurrent with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and sinoatrial block (maximally up to 3.9 sec).
Continuous positive airway pressure therapy could reduce the number of paroxysms of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia and eliminate sinoatrial block.
