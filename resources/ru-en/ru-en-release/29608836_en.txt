[Strategy of surgical treatment of strangulated inguinal hernias in elderly and senile age.]  We analyzed the results of treatment of 80 patients of elderly and senile age with strangulated inguinal hernias, which were divided into two groups.
From 2011 to 2014 were treated 58 patients (group 2) - in the treatment of this group used the traditional approach without the use of endovideosurgical technologies.
From 2015 to 2016, it treated 22 patients (group 1) in the treatment of this group used individual diagnostic and treatment tactics with the use of diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic hernioplasty.
In the course of work were developed indications and contraindications to the use of prosthetic hernioplasty and endovideosurgical methods.
The proposed algorithm allowed to reduce the level of complications from 27,6% (16) to 4,5% (1) (p<0,05) and local complications from 24,1% (14) to 4,6% (1) (p<0,05), as well as the fatality rate from 10,3% (6) to 0%.
