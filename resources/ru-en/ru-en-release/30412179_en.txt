[A variant of the modification of the rhinosurgical intervention with the use of the hemostatic glue].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the dynamics of the nasal breathing function and the quality of life in the patients following septoplastic surgery with the use of the classical method in comparison with the application of the latex tissue glue.
The study included 58 patients presenting with diagnosis of deflected septum of the nose and vasomotor rhinitis.
The following methods were employed for the purpose: anterior active rhinomanometry, evaluation of the transport function of the nasal cavity, and the questionnaire study for the determination of the patients' quality of life.  The patients were allocated to two groups.
Group 1 was comprised of the patients who underwent the classical surgical intervention  (septal surgery with the mechanical disintegration of the inferior turbinated bones.
The patients of the second group were treated with the use of the modified surgical procedure with the use of the latex tisue glue.  The study has demonstrated that the patients treated with the use of the modified approach (including the application of the latex glue) recovered faster and reported a higher quality of life during the postoperative period than the patients of the first group treated by the conventional method.
