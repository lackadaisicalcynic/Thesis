AIM  To assess laparoscopy in diagnosis and treatment of patients with perforated gastroduodenal ulcers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 273 patients with perforated gastroduodenal ulcers who underwent laparoscopy at the Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Care in 2010-2016.
Sample included patients with clinical and instrumental diagnosis of perforated gastroduodenal ulcers, suspected hollow organ perforation including perforated ulcer and other acute abdominal diseases followed by perforated ulcer.  RESULTS
Laparoscopy confirmed diagnosis of perforated gastroduodenal ulcer in 82.5% of patients with clear preoperative diagnosis and in 54.2% of patients with suspected perforated ulcer.  Video-assisted closure of the ulcer is possible in 81.7% of patients.
Any endoscopic procedure should be started from diagnostic measures.  Diagnostic laparoscopy followed by curative laparotomy in 14.6% of patients was able to clarify diagnosis, suture technically difficult perforated ulcer and prevent possible complications.
