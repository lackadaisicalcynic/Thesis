[Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury.  Part 3.
Surgical management of severe traumatic brain injury (Options)].  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the main causes of mortality and severe disability in young and middle age patients.
Patients with severe TBI, who are in coma, are of particular concern.  Adequate diagnosis of primary brain injuries and timely prevention and treatment of secondary injury mechanisms markedly affect the possibility of reducing mortality and severe disability.
The present guidelines are based on the authors' experience in developing international and national recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of mild TBI, penetrating gunshot wounds of the skull and brain, severe TBI, and severe consequences of brain injury, including a vegetative state.
In addition, we used the materials of international and national guidelines for the diagnosis, intensive care, and surgical treatment of severe TBI, which were published in recent years.  The proposed recommendations for surgical treatment of severe TBI in adults are addressed primarily to neurosurgeons, neurologists, neuroradiologists, anesthesiologists, and intensivists who are routinely involved in treating these patients.
