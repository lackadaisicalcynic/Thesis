[Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic synergism between neuropeptides and lithium in the neurotrophic and neuroprotective action of cerebrolysin].
OBJECTIVE
To study the synergism between neuropeptides and lithium ions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
An experimental model of stroke (chronic bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries in rats), neuronal culture studies, histomorphological analyses, determination of micronutrient profile of brain substrates were used.
RESULTS  A complex of experimental studies revealed that the effect of cerebrolysin is influenced by the synergism between lithium ions and the neuropeptide contentof this drug.
Pharmacokinetic synergism promotes the accumulation of lithium in brain tissues during cerebrolysin treatment.  The existence of the pharmacokinetic synergism is evident from the potentiation of neuroprotective effects of the drug under the action of lithium ions established in the model of stroke.
CONCLUSION
Lithium ions potentiate neuroprotective effects of cerebrolysin.
