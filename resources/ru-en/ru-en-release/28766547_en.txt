[Breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma: A case report and a review of literature].
Breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma will be identified as a separate nosological entity in the 2017 adapted WHO classification due to differences in its clinical presentations, pathogenesis, and prognosis with those of nodal and cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphomas.  The paper gives a review of the literature and describes the authors' own clinical case of common breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma involving breast tissue, axillary lymph nodes, anterior chest muscles, and bone marrow.
The treatment policy chosen by the authors could achieve complete remission.
