[The state of ocular neurosensory apparatus in diabetes mellitus].
Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world.  Among its late complications that can lead to disability is diabetic neuropathy (DN).
Patients diagnosed with DN often also have diabetic retinopathy (DR).
According to available data, DR prevalence ranges from 30 to 60%.
For a long time, DR has been considered a microvascular disease.
However, more data has been emerging recently that indicates the presence of other components in the pathophysiology of DR.
Neurodegenerative changes in the retina can be detected in patients with diabetes mellitus before clinical signs of diabetic retinopathy appear.
Accumulation of extracellular glutamate, oxidative stress, reduction of neuroprotective factors synthesized by the retina are all believed to lead to neuronal apoptosis and glial cell dysfunction.
This cascade of reactions subsequently causes disruption of the hematoretinal barrier and damage to neurovascular apparatus of the retina.
This results in the defeat of capillaries of the retinal vascular system, which is consistently characterized by the loss of pericytes and the formation of unperfusable capillaries.
The concept of neurodegeneration being an early component of DR provides an opportunity to explore alternative therapies to prevent the onset of vision loss in diabetes mellitus.
