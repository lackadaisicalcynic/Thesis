[Nasal breath recovery and rhinoplasty in cleft lip and palate patient with unilateral choanal atresia].
The paper presents the analysis of clinical case of endoscopic nasal breath restoration and elimination of the secondary cleft lip nasal deformity in 27 years old patient with unilateral choanal atresia and secondary nasal deformity after rhinocheiloplasty.  Preoperative examination revealed the absence of nasal breathing on collateral side due to complete bone choanal atresia.
Surgical treatment included endoscopic choanal repair, elimination of the secondary nasal deformity, septoplasty, conchotomy and lateroposition of the inferior conchae.
The treatment resulted in nasal breath restoration and elimination of nasal deformity.  Long-term follow-up at 1 and 12 months post-operatively proved stable positive aesthetic and functional results.
