[Etiopathogenetic factors of peripheral neuropathic pain in rheumatoid arthritis].
AIM  To determine a neuropathic component of pain and define its causes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and eighty-three patients with confirmed RA, mean age 46,5±11,7 years, RA duration from 3 month to 30 years, were studied.
Rheumatology, neurological, using the DN4 questionnaire, examinations and stimulation electromyography were used.
Results and сonclusion.
Signs of neuropathic pain (NP) assessed with the DN4 were identified in 73 (43%) patients with RA.
These patients were older, had longer RA duration as well as higher clinical stage of disease and reduced functional abilities.
There were no correlation between NP and disease activity.
Peripheral nervous system (PNS) lesions were seen in 96% patients with NP: sensory motor neuropathy (55%), tunnel syndrome (14%), mononeuropathy (19%) and their combinations (4%), cervical myelopathy (4%).
PNS lesions is the main etiopathogenetic factor of peripheral NP in RA.
This finding opens new perspectives for complex treatment, including group B vitamins, of chronic pain in RA.
