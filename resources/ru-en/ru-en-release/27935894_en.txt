[Outcomes of surgical management of patients with nonspecific aortoarteritis with isolated lesion of brachiocephalic arteries].  The authors analysed herein the results of examination and surgical treatment of patients presenting with Takayasu aortoarteritis with an isolated lesion of the aortic arch branches.
Discrepancy between the degree of ischaemia, dissemination, and localization of lesions, as well as ambiguity of neurological manifestations suggests large compensatory possibilities of the cerebral circulation in this disease.
The revealed peculiarities of lesions of the brachiocephalic arteries characteristic the pathology concerned were as follows: high incidence of lesions of subclavian arteries (mainly in the second and third segments), utterly rare involvement of the brachiocephalic trunk, a stenosisng pattern of lesion of carotid arteries with predominant localization in the common carotid artery, not involving it into the process of bifurcation.
The outcomes of surgical treatment of patients suggest high efficacy of reconstructive operations in the overwhelming majority of the operated patients, also demonstrating considerable advantage of extrathoracic operations as compared with transthoracic ones.
