[The influence of endogenous intoxication on the clinical picture of various forms of acute stenosinglaryngotracheitis in the children].
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of endogenous intoxication on the clinical picture of various forms of acute stenosinglaryngotracheitis in the children.
The clinical and laboratory examination involved 275 patients presenting with this pathology.  Special emphasis was laid on diagnostics of the character and severity of intoxication syndrome.
To this effect, we carried out a dynamic study of variations in the blood levels of medium molecular weight peptides, the toxic blood factor, and circulating immune complexes (CIC).
It is concluded that the parameters of endogenous intoxication in the children with acute stenosinglaryngotracheitis are directly related to the specific clinical features and severity of this disease.
