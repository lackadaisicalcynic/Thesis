[Current approaches to optimize treatment of dementia and Alzheimer's disease].  Currently, substitution therapy is the main focus in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
It is aimed at overcoming neurotransmitter deficits in a variety of neuronal systems affected in AD.  To overcome the cholinergic insufficiency, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, donepezil and galantamine) are primarily used.
The efficacy and safety of these drugs in AD have been convincingly shown in numerous clinical trials in different countries.
Memantine is the main drug in glutamatergic strategies in the treatment of AD, which has a neuroprotective effect and relieves symptoms at the level of the remaining glutamatergic synapses.  Some other formulations (cerebrolysin, nicergoline etc) can be also applied as vasoactive and neuroprotective agents.
