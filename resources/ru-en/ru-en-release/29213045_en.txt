[An effect of epilepsy on sleep structure].  In this review, the authors discuss the problem of management of the patient with epilepsy with regard an impact of epileptic seizures and syndromes on sleep structure.
Sleep disorders can lead to worsening of seizure control and general medical condition of the patients.
However, seizures themselves and types of epilepsy can affect the sleep architecture.
One of the most frequent symptoms of disordered sleep in epilepsy patients is excessive daytime sleepiness, which can be a consequence of poor sleep quality due to frequent nocturnal seizures or excessive interictal epileptiform activity during sleep leading to frequent arousals. is frequently referred to antiepileptic drug side effects.  In patients with frontal and temporal lobe epilepsies, which are more associated with sleep, the sleep architecture is significantly different from healthy individuals.
They have more frequent arousals, disturbed relationship between sleep phases and stages, in particular inhibited REM-sleep phase.
Most recent data on this problem are reviewed.  Sleep patterns for different major epileptic syndromes are presented and some general recommendations for patient management, with a special consideration of sleep issues, are given.
