[The damage to the trigeminal nerve associated with herpetic viral infection in otorhinolaryngology].  Neurotropism of herpetic viral infection is attributable to a wide range of its clinical manifestations.
Theobjective of the present study was to elucidate the specific features of the damage to the trigeminal nerve associated with this condition.
A total of 36 patients presenting with trigeminal nerve neuropathycaused by type 1 herpes simplex infection and 21 patients with trigeminal nerve neuropathy due to Herpes zoster oticus infection were available for the examination and etiopathogenetic treatment.
The traditional clinical methods used in the study were supplemented by virological diagnostics for the verification of herpetic infection and theelectroneurographic technique.
The apparent clinical recovery was documented for 23 and 11 patients of the former and latter groups respectively.
