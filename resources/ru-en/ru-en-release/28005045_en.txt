[Treatment of epilepsy in children with brain tumors].
AIM  Symptomatic focal epilepsy is frequently caused by supratentorial brain tumors that may be surgically removed.
The authors studied outcomes of surgical treatment depending on the use of electrocorticography c (ECoG).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Seventy-five children, aged 5-7 years, with supratentorial brain tumors were examined.  Symptomatic epilepsy was found in 52 (69.3%) patients.
Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNET) and fibrillary astrocytomas were the most epileptogenic tumors.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The outcomes on the Engel scale were as follows: in 27 patients with surgical intervention without ECoG: class I - 9 patients, class II - 7 patients, class III - 5 patients, class IV - 6 patients and in 25 patients operated with ECoG: class I - 19 patients, class II - 4 patients and class III - 2 patients.
The significant difference (p<0.01) between I+II Engel classes in comparison with III+IV Engel classes in operated patients demonstrated the necessity of ECoG during surgery in the resection of supratentorial brain tumors in patients with symptomatic epilepsy.
