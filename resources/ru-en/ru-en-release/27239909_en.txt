[Serum and bile cytokines dynamics in patients with non-tumoral obstructive jaundice and suppurative cholangitis].
AIM  To study serum and bile cytokines dynamics in patients with non-tumoral obstructive jaundice and suppurative cholangitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Comparative study of serum and bile cytokines in 49 operated patients with biliary pathology was performed.
Patients were divided into 3 groups.
The first group included 24 patients with acute calculous cholecystitis (ACCh), the second group consisted of 12 patients with chronic calculous cholecystitis (CCCh) and the third group included 13 patients with choledocholithiasis complicated by obstructive jaundice and suppurative cholangitis.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
All patients had increased level of TNF-α, IL-4 и IL-6.
There was augmentation of biliary cytokines in patients with obstructive jaundice compared with those with acute and chronic calculous cholecystitis.
In patients with obstructive jaundice and suppurative cholangitis the highest levels of cytokines were observed.
Patients with obstructive jaundice (OJ), suppurative cholangitis (SCh) and chronic calculous cholecystitis had higher levels of cytokines in both blood and bile than in those with OJ, SCh and acute calculous cholecystitis that is explained by development of purulent inflammation on background of previous cytokines imbalance and chronic inflammation.
In general, patients with acute calculous cholecystitis had higher levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in blood serum and IL-4 in bile.
Patients with chronic calculous cholecystitis had higher concentration of TNF-α and IL-4 in bile and IL-6 - in blood serum.
CONCLUSION
Both forms of cholecystitis and their complications are associated with increased cytokines in serum and bile.  The level of augmentation depends on the type of inflammation and complications.
Comparative study of cytokines can be the most informative criterion to monitor the postoperative period.
