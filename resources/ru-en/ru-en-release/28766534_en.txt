[Clinical features of essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, depending on the molecular characteristics of disease].  The aim of the present paper was to evaluate the clinical features and risk of thrombotic events (TE) in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), depending on the molecular characteristics of disease.
Clinical data and laboratory parameters were analyzed in 50 ET patients and 50 PMF ones who had been followed up at the Department for Standardization of Treatments, National Research Center for Hematology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, from February 2015 to September 2016.
The patients with ET and those with PMF were found to have a high risk of TE.
The risk for TE in the patients with ET is higher (24% in the entire group) than in those with PMF (14% in the study group).
In ET, there is a high thrombosis risk in the detection of JAK2 and CALR gene mutations as compared with triple-negative cases.
The PMF patients with JAK2 V617F mutations are at high risk for TE compared to those who are CALR mutation carriers and in triple-negative cases.
There was no significant association of TE with high thrombocytosis.
A factor, such as age, was found to be of no negative prognostic value in the patients with PMF.
