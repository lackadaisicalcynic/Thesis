[A comparative study of the efficacy of personality-oriented (reconstructive) and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy in neurotic anxiety disorders with insomnia].  AIM
To study personality-oriented (reconstructive) and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy in patients with neurotic anxiety disorders with insomnia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ninety-eight patients with disorders coded in ICD-10 as F 40.0; F40.1; F41.0; F41.1; F48.0 were studied.  Clinical, psychometric, experimental-psychological methods and polysomnography were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Phenomenological insomnia types characteristic of neurotic anxiety disorders and their relationship with types of intrapersonal conflicts are described.
A quantitative analysis of the dynamics of symptomatic complains, anxiety level, and insomnia is presented.
The efficacy of the both psychotherapeutic treatments is shown.
However the personality oriented (reconstructive) psychotherapy has demonstrated better and more stable results.  This can be explained first of all by its pathogenesis-oriented nature and involvement of the cognitive emotional and behavioral spheres as well as the resolution of the intrapersonal conflicts, which are the cornerstone of neurotic disorders.
