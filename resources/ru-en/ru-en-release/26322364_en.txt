[Sleep disturbances in children with autistic spectrum disorders].  An association between sleep disorders and autistic spectrum disorders in children is considered.
Characteristic variants of sleep disorders, including resistance to going to bed, frequent night awakenings, parasomnias, changes in sleep structure, primarily, the decrease in the percentage of rapid eye movement sleep, are presented.
Attention is focused on the possibility of the direct relationship between sleep disturbance and the pathogenesis of autistic spectrum disorders.
A role of pathological alterations in the production of neuromediators and morphological changes in the brain structures characteristic of autistic spectrum disorders in the genesis of sleep disorders in children is discussed.
Possible non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches are suggested.
