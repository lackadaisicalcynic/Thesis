[Successful two-stage surgical treatment of a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm: a case report].  Presented herein is a clinical case report regarding hybrid or two-stage surgical treatment of a Crawford type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm in an 87-year-old woman.
For the first stage operation we performed open resection of the abdominal aortic aneurysm with aortofemoral bifurcation prosthetic repair and debranching of visceral and renal arteries.
Several months thereafter, the second stage operation was performed, consisting in transcatheter exclusion of the thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with the help of two stent grafts.
The postoperative period turned out uneventful, with no complications.
The check-up contrast-enhanced multislice computed tomography (MSCT) carried out 8 months later showed neither endoleaks nor migration of the stent grafts, with the bypass shunts' patency preserved.
