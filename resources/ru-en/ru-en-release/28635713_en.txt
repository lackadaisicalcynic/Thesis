[Intravenous immunoglobulins: perspectives in multiple sclerosis (a literature review with own results)].  In this review, we have analyzed a role of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) in multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy.
Main mechanisms of IVIGs are elucidated and the results of the most prominent investigations of IVIGs in MS are reported.
Based on these data, we discuss a role of IVIGs as second line therapy in MS.
We also present results of our own open observational study of IVIG therapy of 41 patients with relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive with relapses MS, in which a clear decrease of relapse rate (by 2-3 times) and disability (in average by 0.38-0.48 EDSS points) were revealed.
We found some differences between complex IVIGs and pure IgG IVIGs clinical efficacy with some prevalence of complex IVIGs that were discussed.  High IVIGs safety and tolerability (only slight transitory side effects in up to 14% of patients) were found.
