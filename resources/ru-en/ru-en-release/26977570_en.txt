[The possibility of using соformulated intranasal drugs after surgical correction of nasal breathing].  One of the major causes of chronic nasal obstruction is the nasal septum deformation and increase of the lower nasal turbinates.
The number of septoplasty--operations ranges from 14% to 44,2% of all ENT-operations.
The results of surgery are swelling of the tissues and damaged ciliar epithelium, that leads to the inparament of the mucociliar transport.  In the postoperati e period the nasal cavity should be cleaned.
Drugs, that are used, should reduce swelling, improve regeneration and should not supress ciliar activity.  The results of supervisory, non-interventional study have shown, that application of Nasiс after septoplasty and submucose vasotomy of inferior nasal turbinates increases reparative process and leads to more rapid recovery of respiratory function of nasal cavity.
