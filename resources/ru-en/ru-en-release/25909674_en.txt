[The electron microscopic study of tumour-like structures on the vocal cords].  We have undertaken the electron microscopic investigation into peculiarities of six tumour-like structures on the vocal cords.
The study has demonstrated changes in the number and distribution patterns of intercellular junctions, keratin and tonofilament contents in epithelial cells, basal membrane structure, and composition of the basic substance in lamina propria.
All the examined tumour-like structures contained bacteria an two of them had viral particles in vacuoles of fibroblasts.
Moreover, the bacteria were found on the surface of epithelium, between epithelial cells and in the basic substance in lamina propria.  Cytoplasm of epithelial cells and fibroblasts not infrequently contained bacteria in the phase of division.
