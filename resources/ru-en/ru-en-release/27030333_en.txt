[Possible influence of epidemiological risk factors on the development of urolithiasis].
AIM  To study the epidemiological factors participating in the development of urolithiasis as risk factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The results of the 2007-2011 examinations and follow-ups of 2305 patients diagnosed with urolithiasis, who had been treated at the bases of the Department of Urology, Azerbaijan Medical University, at the Acad.  M.A. Mirkasimov Republican Clinical Hospital, and at the central hospitals in the North and North West regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan, were analyzed.
In most cases, the 16-30- and 41-50-year age groups were at high risk for urolithiasis; an association was found between body mass index and the development of this disease.  The mineral salt composition of stones was characterized by oxalate content in the majority of cases; urates ranked second.
Urolithiasis was considered to be predominantly related to poor and satisfactory living conditions in most cases.
Calculogensis in urolithiasis was most common in the people who had sedentary jobs, or in the unemployed.  Examining the association of calculogenesis in urolithiasis patients with their geographical site type showed that the majority of these patients lived in the rural areas.
CONCLUSION
The males who are older, overweight, lead a sedentary lifestyle or are unemployed, specifically those who live in the rural area, must more carefully implement preventive measures.
