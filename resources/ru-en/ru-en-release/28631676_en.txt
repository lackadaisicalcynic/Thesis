[The influence of nasal packing on the quality of life in the early postoperative period following septoplastic surgery].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of anterior nasal packing on the physical health condition and the quality of life of the patients in the early postoperative period following septoplastic surgery and to propose an alternative to the anterior nasal packing procedure.
The study included 90 patients divided into three groups.
Those of the first group underwent endoscopic septoplasty, the patients of the second group were managed by standard septoplastic surgery, and the patients of group 3 were given treatment with the use of modified septoplasty including the application of a fibrin sealant as an alternative to nasal tampons.
It was shown that anterior nasal packing exerts the undesirable influence on the quality of life during the early postoperative period following septoplastic surgery whereas the use of the modified technique based on the application of a fibrin sealant as an alternative therapeutic modality significantly enhances the effectiveness of the treatment.
