[Associations of lipoproteins with bone mass in postmenopausal women].
AIM  To study an association between blood lipid composition and bone mass in Russian postmenopausal women.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The cross-sectional study included 373 postmenopausal women aged 45-80 years who were examined to diagnose osteoporosis in outpatient settings.
Height, body weight, and waist and hip circumferences (WC and HC) were measured before densitometry.
Quetelet's index was calculated as a ratio of weight (kg) to height (m2).
The concentration of lipids and apolipoproteins (apo) AÐ† and B were measured by enzyme immunoassay.
Bone mineral density (BMD) in the spine and proximal femur (PF) was estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.
RESULTS
According to bone mass, the patients were divided into three groups: 1) osteoporosis (OP); 2) osteopenia; 3) normal BMD.
The levels of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were significantly higher in the postmenopausal women with OP than in those with normal bone mass.
There was a negative correlation of cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels with lumbar spine BMD and that of HDL levels with BMD in the femoral neck (FN) and entire PF.
The level of lipoprotein (a) (LPa) was significantly lower in the group of patients with OP and positively correlated with BMD in FN and entire PF.
After adjustment for age, the duration of menopause, Quetelet's index, and WC/HC association remained only between LPa and FN BMD.
CONCLUSION
Multivariate regression analysis failed to confirm a trend towards decreased BMD and increased HDL cholesterol.
This suggests that the association of HDL cholesterol with bone mass is apparently mediated by other factors and, above all, with age, postmenopausal hormonal status and body weight.
