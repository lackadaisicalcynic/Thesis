[Treatment of depression with cognitive impairment].
AIM  To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of monotherapy with agomelatine (valdoxan) in depressive patients with marked cognitive impairment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-five patients (women 77.1%) were recruited to participate in the study.  Mean age of patients was 48.9Â±3.5 years.
The following scales and cognitive tests were used: HAM-21, CGI, HADS, MMSE, the Stroop task, the Rey test, RAVLT.
Effective therapeutic doses of valdoxan were 25mg per day in 77.1% of patients, 50 mg per day beginning from week 2 in 22.9%.  Cognitive impairment was found in astheno-apathic depression (51.4%), anxiety-hypochondriacal depression (28.6%), anhedonic depression (5.7%).
RESULTS
The results showed that 74.3% of patients were responders and 51.4% were in remission.
The dynamic of cognitive impairment demonstrated the positive effect of treatment with agomelatine (valdoxan).
Beneficial safety profile of valdoxan was confirmed.
CONCLUSION
Valdoxan is the effective and relatively safe antidepressant; it can be recommended for treatment of depression with cognitive impairment in therapeutic doses for at least 6 weeks.
