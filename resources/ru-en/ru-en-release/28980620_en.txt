[Pharmacoeconomic aspects of combined treatment of advanced stage of Parkinson's disease].
AIM  To assess the cost-efficiency of the fixed levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone combination and the free combination of levodopa/carbidopa with rasagiline.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
An analysis was performed using the Markov model including three clinical states: duration of off-time â‰¤25%, duration of off-time >25% and fatal outcome.  Costs of the drugs were calculated based on the results of auctions for 2016 by IMS Health data.
RESULTS  In basic variant (drugs containing levodopa, 5-times a day), costs of treatment with the fixed levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone combination were 2.45 times higher than with rasagiline + levodopa/carbidopa.
When taking levodopa drugs 3 times a day, costs of treatment with levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone were 1.53 times higher.  Costs of treatment with rasagiline in combination with levodopa/carbidopa were lower by 10.4% even in the least beneficial variant of sensitivity analysis (maximal cost of rasagiline, maximal cost of levodopa/carbidopa and minimal cost of the fixed levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone combination).
In basic variant, the cost-efficiency of treatment with rasagiline in combination with levodopa/carbidopa at the advanced stage of Parkinson's disease was 281.4 thousand roubles/QALY.
CONCLUSION
Rasagiline in combination with levodopa/carbidopa is clinically and economically expedient for treatment of patients at the advanced stage of Parkinson's disease because of the reduction of costs compared to the fixed levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone combination.
