[Effect of surgical treatment of thyroid nodules in older patients the likelihood of developing osteoporosis, the role of low levels of calcitonin].
In the article describes the role of deficiency of calcitonin, which originate after surgical operations on the thyroid gland, in headway of osteoporosis.
Regarded significance such factors as age, level of parathyroid hormone, volume of the operational intervention in the development of osteoporosis.
In elder people with thyroid nodular pathology bone metabolism is influenced by the amount of thyroid residue after resection.  After thyroidectomy thyrocalcitonin is not produced, but the function of parathyroid glands remains normal, and this contributes to the progression of osteoporosis.
In case of limited thyroid resection minimal changes can be observed in bone metabolism.
