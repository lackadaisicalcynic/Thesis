[An experience of single lung resection and pneumonectomy after contralateral lung resection in treatment of tuberculosis].  AIM
To improve the efficiency of treatment of single lung destructive tuberculosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  15-year experience of operations for destructive tuberculosis performed by the same surgeon including 18 resections of the single lung and 19 pneumonectomies after previous partial lung resection is presented in the article.
RESULTS
Surgical management of patients with destructive tuberculosis of single lung provides positive results in more than 90% of cases.  However the frequency of its application is still low according to literature data.
In case of destructive tuberculosis of single lung partial resection is more frequently indicated if fibrous-cavernous tuberculosis of the upper lung (up to 4 damaged segments), persistent bacterial excretion on the background of adequate chemotherapy and pathogen's drug resistance are present.
