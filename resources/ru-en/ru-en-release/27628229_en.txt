[Single-port cholecystectomy - pros and cons].
AIM  to study efficacy and safety of current laparoscopic techniques of cholecystectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  3 groups of patients were defined.
Single laparoscopic access with/without trocar support was used in group 1 (SILS+, n=10) and 2 (SILS, n=16) respectively.  Conventional four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy was applied in comparison group.
RESULTS
SILS+ and SILS techniques were associated with less pain syndrome within first 12 hours after surgery compared with four-port cholecyst-ectomy.
Better cosmetic result is also achieved in case of single-port technique.
Both methods are comparable in their safety.
CONCLUSION
SILS-techniques are current alternatives to four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to better cosmetic result, mild postoperative pain syndrome and comparable safety.
