[The individual and combined antioxidant effects of citicoline and ethylmethylhydroxypyridini succinas].
AIM  To study the antioxidant status of patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) during the individual treatment with 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-succinate (neurox) and in the combination with citicoline (neipilept).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A study included 40 patients, 18 men and 22 women, aged from 54 to 72 years, with CCI, stage 2, at the decompensation stage complicated with the hypertensive crisis and/or arrhythmia.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A significant increase in the serum superoxide dismutase activity after the complex therapy with neurox and neipilept was demonstrated compared to patients treated with neurox.
A study of reduced sulfur-hydroxy groups in patients treated with 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-succinate and patients treated with the combination of 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-succinate and citicoline, revealed a significant increase in the number of reduced SH- groups after the treatment with neurox compared to the combined use of neurox and neipilept.
