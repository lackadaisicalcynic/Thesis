[Pantogam augmentation in hyperkinetic behavior disorder treatment].  A clinical case of a child with hyperkinetic conduct disorder is presented, with symptoms of hyperkinetic disorder itself closely intertwining with symptoms of conduct disorder.
The qualitative changes in the child's condition are noted, including not only achieved control over the symptoms, but also improved social functioning level, achieved by means of Pantogam (neuroprotective drug) addition to atomoxetine therapy.
The proposed strategy can contribute to improvement of treatment results for children with certain clinical types of hyperkinetic conduct disorder.
