The paper describes cases of disseminated small-cell carcinoma after kidney transplantation from a deceased donor to two patients.  Microscopic examination showed that the kidney graft tumor consisted of tightly packed small rounded cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and a narrow cytoplasmic rim with invisible nucleoli.
Immunohistochemical examination revealed the expression of synaptophysin, chromogranin A, CD56, TTF-1, HMWK, СК7, СК18, and Ki-67 (80% of tumor cells).  Histological findings and immunophenotype in both cases led to the conclusion about combined small cell carcinoma with renal graft involvement.
In reviewing the literature, the authors found only one such observation.
