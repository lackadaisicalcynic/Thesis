[Stagewise treatment of a giant false paraanastomotic aneurysm of the abdominal aorta].  The article deals with a case report concerning successful stagewise treatment of a patient presenting with a giant false abdominal aortic paraanastomotic aneurysm having developed 2 months after an operation of linear prosthetic repair for a juxtarenal aneurysm with reimplantation of the left renal artery.
The secondary operation was carried out 3 months after aortic reconstruction.
The first stage consisted in performing endovascular prosthetic repair of the abdominal aortic paraanastomotic pseudoaneurysm by means of a bifurcated stent graft Endurant II (Medtronic), with the second stage being laparotomy with the removal of the retroperitoneal haematoma.
The postoperative period turned out uneventful.
The patient was discharged from hospital on the 8th day after the second operation.
The patient was examined 2 months later, presenting no complaints and returning to his previous work.
According to the findings of the check-up duplex scanning, the graft was patient, with no evidence of a paraanastomotic aneurysm.
This is followed by discussion of the problems regarding the use of surgical and endovascular technologies in treatment of paraanastomotic aortic aneurysms.
