[Psychogenic depression and endogenous process (to the problem of reactive schizophrenia)].  OBJECTIVE
To conduct clinical differentiation of stress-induced conditions in schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders according to the concept of so-called "Reactive schizophrenia" (J. Berze).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A sample consisted of 40 patients (14 male, 26 female, mean age 38.6Â±12.5. 17 years), including 17 (42%) patients with schizophrenia, 16 (40%) patients with ICD-10 schizotypal disorder and 7 (18%) patients with DSM-V schizotypal personality disorder.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
All clinical cases were divided into two groups according to the discrepancy of endogenous/psychogenic factor interaction, clinical aspects and disease course.  In the first group, the onset of stress-induced depression is due to psychogenic provocations of endogenous (schizophreniform) disorders.
In the second group, the development of depression is based on the endogenous provocation of psychogenias (an increased affinity to stressful factors associated with the exacerbation of the endogenous process).
