[The morphological changes in the myocardial tissue after sudden cardiac death from alcoholic cardiomyopathy].  This paper was designed to report the results of the retrospective analysis of the protocols of 180 forensic medical autopsy sections stored in the archives of Sankt-Petersburg Bureau of Forensic Medical Expertise and the data of the histological studies of myocardial tissues obtained after sudden cardiac death from alcoholic cardiomyopathy.
The study revealed the following most pathognomonic histological criteria for alcoholic heart lesions: the alternation of hypertrophic and atrophic cardiomyocytes in the state of severe parenchymatous degeneration, pronounced mesenchymal fatty dystrophy in combination with pathological changes of the vascular walls (vascular wall plasmatization), sub-endothelial accumulation of the PAS-positive tissue compounds, microcirculatory disorders in the form of erythrocyte stasis with the manifestations of the blood "sludge" phenomenon, and precapillary fibrosis.
The signs of severe parenchymatous and stromal vascular dystrophy of the myocardial histohematic barrier (HHB) are supposed to reflect the toxic effects of ethanol and its metabolites that are directly involved in the mechanisms underlying the disturbances of intracellular metabolism and dyscirculatory events leading to the development of heart muscle hypoxia.
