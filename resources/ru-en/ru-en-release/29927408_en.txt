[Neurospecific proteins in cerebrospinal fluid and in the bloodserum of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis].  AIM
To determine concentrations of neurospecific enolase (NSE) and S100b protein in bloodserum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with different forms (onset) and duration of ALS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Concentrations of NSE and S100b in serum and CSF were studied in 86 patients with different forms and duration of ALS.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Concentrations of NSE and S100b protein in CSF were significantly higher in the group of patients with bulbar form and in the group with duration of disease less than 1 year compared to the control group.  There was a negative correlation of S100b protein in CSF with ALSFRSR score in the group of patients with bulbar ALS.
An increase in NSE concentration in CSF and serum in patients with cervico-thoracic form of ALS and in patients with disease duration from 1 to 4 years was found.  Concentrations of protein S100b remained the same.
A significant decrease in the concentration gradient of S100b protein (CSF/serum) in patients with disease duration more than 1 year suggests the disturbances of blood-brain barrier permeability with increasing ALS duration and confirms the role of these changes in the pathogenesis of the disease.
