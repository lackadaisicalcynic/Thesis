[Assessment of factors influencing the outcome of new-onset infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis].
AIM  To identify predictors for the poor outcome of infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis (IPTB).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The social, epidemiological, and medical risk factors and clinical features of IPTB were assessed in 130 first detected patients.  The findings were classified using a cluster analysis and then a variance analysis, followed by the ranking of its results.
RESULTS  The primarily diagnosed disseminated destructive process with respiratory and cardiopulmonary failure, excretion of both resistant and multi-resistant pathogenic bacteria had a strong impact on the poor outcome of tuberculosis (TB) in the first detected patients.
Its outcome was also influenced by a set of social factors, such as poor material living conditions, stay in corrective labor facilities, and a lack of education.
The unfavorable outcome of TB was significantly due to organizational factors, such as bad habits; refusal to undergo fluorography during a few years; and a medical factor as comorbidities.
CONCLUSION
Based on the identified factors, the authors formulated recommendations for working with the first detected IPTB patients at risk for a poor disease outcome.
