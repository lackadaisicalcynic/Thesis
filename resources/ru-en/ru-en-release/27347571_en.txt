[Intravitreal injection as a possible model for studying biomechanics of fibrous tunic].  The article summarized the results of Russian and foreign research concerning biomechnical principles of eye functioning as an integral physiological system.
Quite a number of studies have been published on corneal and scleral mechanics, which is also part of the said system.
These studies fall largely into three groups: in vivo studies (involving living organism), in vitro studies (within an artificial environment), and mathematical modeling.
In vivo techniques are often rather complicated and, therefore, most studies are based on in vitro procedures.  Due to the growing number of intravitreal injections, they can be regarded as a stress test for studying fibrous tunic biomechanics in vivo.
The results of such studies would contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of various eye diseases and thus, a better clinical practice.
