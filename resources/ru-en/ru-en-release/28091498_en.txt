[The differences in the estimation of depression severity by psychiatrists and patients during the combined treatment with agomelatine (a multicenter study "EMOTSIA")].  AIM
To compare the prognosis of depression severity estimated by the physician and by the patient based on the treatment outcome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  One hundred and seven patients with depression were examined.
Mental status was assessed with HАМ-D, SHAPS, CGI-S, CGI-I, PGI-S, PGI-I and VAS.  A data analysis was performed.
RESULTS
There were differences in the estimation of depression severity by psychiatrists and patients.
Moreover, the scores on HАМ-D and CGI-S were not consistent when assessed by psychiatrists.  As the severity of depression decreased and patient's state improved during the treatment with agomelatine (valdoxan), the assessments of the changes by the psychiatrist and the patient became similar.
CONCLUSION
Agomelatine (valdoxan) is effective and tolerable in the treatment of depression of any severity.
The differences between the psychiatrist's and patient's estimation of the depression severity at baseline using different psychometric scales can level the prognostic value of treatment outcome.
