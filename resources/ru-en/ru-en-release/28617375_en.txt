[Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness].
AIM  To study persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) in outpatients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and patients with presbiataxia (PAt).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty-four patients with PPPD, including 14 with Meniere's disease (MD), 19 with BPPV, 17 with a history of ischemic stroke (IS) in the vertebrobasilar system and 34 with Pat, were examined.
For the diagnosis of anxiety, the original 15-point questionnaire with the Likert Scale structure was used.
Patients received anvifen (aminophenylbutyric acid hydrochloride) in dose of 250 mg 3 times a day for 6 weeks.
Results and сonclusion.
The most common trigger of PPPD was sleep deprivation.
The highest level of anxiety was identified in the PAt group (19,5±2,89).
There was a good effect of the drug: it reduced anxiety in all patients studied.
The quality of sleep was improved as well.
The authors recommend anvifen as the drug of choice in patients with PPPD during vestibular rehabilitation and cognitive-behavioral therapy.
