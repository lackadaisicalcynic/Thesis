[Effect of combined application of ozone therapy and gravitational therapy on the remote results of complex treatment of geriatric patients].
Skin aging is one of the topical issues in modern gerontocosmetology.  Application of cosmetic products with short peptides is a promising measure for retardation of skin aging.
This research is aimed at investigation of KE (Lys-Glu, Vilon) dipeptide influence on the expression of markers of aging in human skin fibroblasts in vitro.
Collagen type I and sirtuin-6 expression in «young» and «old» skin cell fibroblasts cultures was studied using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy method.
The areas of expression of collagen type I and sirtuin-6 are known to decrease in skin fibroblasts with aging by 3,5 and 3,6 times accordingly.
KE dipeptide increases collagen type I expression area in «old» skin fibroblasts cultures by 83%.  KE dipeptide increases expression area of sirtuin-6 in «young» and «old» skin fibroblasts cultures by 1,6 and 2,6 times correspondingly.
Thus, KE dipeptide promotes functional activity of skin fibroblasts and inhibits their aging.
