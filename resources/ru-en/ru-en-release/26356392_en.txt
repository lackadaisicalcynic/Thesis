[A comparative hormonal and clinical analysis of thyrotoxicosis with- or without comorbid resistant depression].
AIM
To compare clinical and hormonal status in thyrotoxicosis with- or without comorbid resistant depression.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 100 patients with thyrotoxicosis, including 61 patients with comorbid resistant depression (RD) and 39 patients without RD.
Mental status, somatic symptoms of disease and blood content of main thyroid hormones were studied.  The Hamilton scale was used to measure depression and anxiety.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Depression developed in the structure of thyrotoxicosis increased the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
However, it did not change the general tendency of development of the main disease assessed by hormonal indicators.
