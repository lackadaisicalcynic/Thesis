[Quality of life of patients with complicated reflux-esophagitis followed antireflux surgery].  AIM
To analyze quality of life of patients with complicated reflux-esophagitis followed antireflux surgery.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The trial enrolled 200 patients who underwent surgical treatment at the Burdenko Faculty Surgery Clinic of Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University for complicated reflux esophagitis from 2008 to 2015.
Inclusion criteria were long-standing reflux esophagitis irresistible to conservative treatment, hiatal hernia with shortening of the esophagus and/or peptic stricture and/or Barrett's esophagus.
Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the degree of esophagus shortening: group I - 98 patients with esophagus shortening degree I; group II - 102 patients with shortening grade II. Men/women ratio was 87(43.5%)/113(56.5%).
Mean age was 56.0±13.9 years (16-83 years).
We performed fundoplication in A.F. Chernousov modification in the first group and modified valvular gastroplication in the second group.
All patients underwent survey within 6 months - 10 years after surgery to assess long-term outcomes.
X-ray examination, upper GI endoscopy, standard laboratory tests were performed with pH-impedance and computed tomography if it was necessary.
Quality of life was estimated by RAND SF-36 and GSRS (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) questionnaires.
RESULTS  SF-36 questionnaire revealed postoperative changes of physical, psychological and social values and was able to compare them with those in general population.
Postoperative overall health was significantly higher in both groups compared with preoperative level and comparable with general population.  GSRS questionnaire have also revealed positive changes.
Overall postoperative GSRS score was 1.6±0.5 and 1.6±0.6 points in groups I and II respectively that corresponds to minor concern after surgery.
