[Respiratory hypercapnic-hypoxic training is an effective component of complex therapy of polyneuropathy in children with diabetes type 1].
AIM  To study the effectiveness of respiratory hypercapnic-hypoxic training in complex treatment of neuropathy due to diabetes type 1.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty children, 31 girls and 19 boys, were examined.
The inclusion criteria were the presence of polyneuropathy, verified on the basis of clinical data and electromyographic changes.  The patients were divided into 2 groups: the main group
(n=25, 15 girls and 10 boys, mean age 12.9±1.8 years (M±SD) and the comparison group (n=25, 16 girls and 9 boys, mean age 13.2±2.0 years).  Patients of the main group, along with standard therapy received respiratory hypercapnic-hypoxic training.
RESULTS
The positive clinical and neurophysiological dynamics was noted in both groups, with more significant changes in children after respiratory training.  CONCLUSION
Hypercapnic exercises significantly contribute to the pathogenetic therapy of diabetes mellitus and polyneuropathy in this disease, have a significant clinical effects reducing serum concentrations of fasting glucose and severity of neurological deficit scores on the NIS-LL, increasing the speed of conduction of excitation through the nerves, reducing the residual latency of EMG activity.
