Estimates of alcohol-related oesophageal cancer burden in Japan: systematic review and meta-analyses.  OBJECTIVE
To refine estimates of the burden of alcohol-related oesophageal cancer in Japan.
METHODS  We searched PubMed for published reviews and original studies on alcohol intake, aldehyde dehydrogenase polymorphisms, and risk for oesophageal cancer in Japan, published before 2014.
We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, including subgroup analyses by aldehyde dehydrogenase variants.  We estimated deaths and loss of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from oesophageal cancer using exposure distributions for alcohol based on age, sex and relative risks per unit of exposure.
FINDINGS
We identified 14 relevant studies.  Three cohort studies and four case-control studies had dose-response data.
Evidence from cohort studies showed that people who consumed the equivalent of 100 g/day of pure alcohol had an 11.71 fold, (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.67-51.32) risk of oesophageal cancer compared to those who never consumed alcohol.
Evidence from case-control studies showed that the increase in risk was 33.11 fold (95% CI: 8.15-134.43) in the population at large.
The difference by study design is explained by the 159 fold (95% CI: 27.2-938.2) risk among those with an inactive aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme variant.
Applying these dose-response estimates to the national profile of alcohol intake yielded 5279 oesophageal cancer deaths and 102,988 DALYs lost - almost double the estimates produced by the most recent global burden of disease exercise.  CONCLUSION
Use of global dose-response data results in an underestimate of the burden of disease from oesophageal cancer in Japan.  Where possible, national burden of disease studies should use results from the population concerned.
