[Risk factors of postoperative complications in patients with synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastases].  AIM
Univariate and multivariate analysis of various risk factors and morbidity in patients with synchronous colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Prospective data of 173 patients with synchronous CRC liver metastases have been analyzed from January 2013 to February 2017 at the Ryzhikh State Coloproctology Research Center.
RESULTS
In multivariate analysis significant risk factors of morbidity were age ≤61 years, the largest liver metastasis ≥ 2.1 cm (odds ratio (OR) 2.99; 95% CI 1.4-6.5), number of liver metastases >1 (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1-5.5), bilobar liver injury (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.3-4.8), blood loss (OR 1.001; 95% CI 1.0001-1.002).
Model for prediction of complications was constructed (AUC 0.79).
CONCLUSION
Simultaneous surgery is not risk factor of complications.
Probability of complications is increased in advanced tumor and consequently more traumatic surgery.
Predictive model is useful for prognosis of complications and describes surgical experience of State Coloproctology Research Center.
