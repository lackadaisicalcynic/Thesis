[The role of integrated assessment of the indicators of external respiration function in cardiac surgical patients].  This literature review dedicated to the importance of an integrated assessment of external respiratory function in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including an analysis of up-to-date techniques, such as spirometry, body plethysmography, examination of the diffusing capacity of the lung, determination of O2 consumption with evaluation of the effectiveness of pulmonary ventilation.
It considers the pathogenetic components of impairments in pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange, which develop in different CVDs, as well as during and after cardiac surgery.
The authors analyze the results of international investigations and their own experience, which emphasize the prognostic value of lung function tests and suggest that there is a need for a comprehensive functional assessment of the respiratory system in cardiac surgical patients for their effective preoperative preparation, assessment and reduction of operational risks, and improvement of the prognosis of surgical treatment.
