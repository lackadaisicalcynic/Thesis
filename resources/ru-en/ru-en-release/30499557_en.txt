To study diagnostic possibilities for determining the content of nitrite and N-nitroso compounds (NO2-+RNNO) in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (IS).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
CSF in patients with IS contained nitrite and N-nitroso compounds (NO2-+RNNO) in concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 2.0 Âµm.  The relationship between the size of IS and the concentration of NO2-+RNNO in CSF was shown.
There was no correlation between the severity of neurological deficit at the time of hospitalization and discharge from the hospital and the content of NO2-+RNNO in CSF (r=0.134; p>0.5; r=0.155; p>0.5, respectively).  Plasma NO2-+RNNO levels were not associated with the presence and size of IS though they were elevated in patients with inflammatory complications.
