[Retinal vein occlusion management algorithm.  Part 1.
Classification, diagnosis, and acute-stage treatment].
Considering an upward global trend in cardiovascular disease rates, retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in particular, development of therapeutic guidelines is a pressing issue in ophthalmology.  Risk factors for RVO include hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, blood disorders, inflammatory disorders, and prescription drug use.
Three stages of RVO have been identified.
By location, the entity can be divided into three big groups: central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), and hemicentral retinal vein occlusion (HCRVO), each being either ischemic or nonischemic.  Functional prognosis is better in nonischemic occlusions.
Patient management comprises acute-stage treatment (anticoagulants, fibrinolytic agents, and hemodilution) and struggling with ocular complications (intravitreal injections and laser coagulation).  It is essential that primary assessment and follow-up of patients at any stage of RVO include optical coherence tomography and fluorescent angiography.
