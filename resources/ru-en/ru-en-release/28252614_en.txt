[The distribution of amlodipine in the organism of the warm-blooded animals].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the specific features of amlodipine distribution in the organism of the warm-blooded animals (rats) following a single intragastric administration of the poisonous substance at a dose of 686 mg/kg b/w/ (LD50).
Amlodipine was isolated from the blood and various organs of the animals by means of acetone extraction and purified on the silica gel column (100/160 mcm) with the elution by an ethanol-hexane (7:3) mixture.
The identification and the quantitative measurement of amlodipine were performed with the use of the TLC, GC-M, and UV-spectrophotometry.
The study has shown that unmetabolized amlodipine was present in large amounts in the internal organs and blood of the poisoned animals.
The principal organs of its accumulation were the stomach, kidneys, and blood.
