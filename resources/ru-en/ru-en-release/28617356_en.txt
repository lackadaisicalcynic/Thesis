[The association of the FAS/APO-1 (rs2234767) gene polymorphism with the risk and rapid progression of multiple sclerosis].
AIM  To evaluate the association of the FAS/APO-1 (rs2234767) gene polymorphism with the risk of multiple sclerosis and its progression dynamics.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A case-control study included 100 patients with recurrent multiple sclerosis (MS), Russians from the Altai Territory, and 100 healthy volunteers.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to genotype the 1377G>A polymorphism in the promoter of the FAS/APO-1 (rs2234767) gene.
Association of this polymorphism with the risk of multiple sclerosis and its progression was evaluated.
RESULTS
The G/А genotype and the А-allele were associated with the increased risk of multiple sclerosis.
The G/А genotype and the А-allele were associated with the risk of high progression rate of the disease.  The G/G genotype and the G-allele had a protective effect.
CONCLUSION
Predisposition to MS as well as to high progression rate are associated with the FAS/APO-1*G/А gene in Russians living in the Altai Territory.
Further research is required to make the conclusion.
