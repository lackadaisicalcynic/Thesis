[Current trends of the choice and processing of materials for dental implantation].  For assessment of the modern situation about the choice of materials for manufacture of dental implants and the processing of their surface the scientific literature for the last 2 years was study.
On the basis of a large number of contradictory results of the researches devoted to each of dental implantation problems it is possible to draw a conclusion that any of primal problems of implantology is finally not solved.
There is no unique opinion at the choice of optimum material for manufacture of dental implants, at the way of processing and modification of their surface.
The problem of improvement of quality of dental implantation and fight against complications of this procedure cannot be solved simple drawing other substances on the implanted material surface, this task more easily and more successfully is solved via changes of product structure and various modification of implant surface.
Up to the present the researches of an opportunity to influence on characteristics of the implanted materials, changing their structure and character of a surface, continue.
And the publications reporting about the considerable positive effect of artificially created roughnesses on product surfaces, and the articles claiming that there are no big differences between the rough and polished implants are confirmed by objective measurements with statistical processing of the obtained data.
It should be noted that among articles there are very many works of the doubtful plan or with insufficiently valid conclusions.
This review leads to the conclusion that further clinical and experimental studies and about the choice of materials for manufacture of implants and at the ways of processing of their surface are necessary.
