[Small bowel injuries due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelet therapy.  Approaches to prevention and treatment].
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced small bowel injuries (NSAID enteropathies) become clinically important.  Videocapsule endoscopy shows that the small bowel is involved in NSAID-related gastrointestinal tract (GIT) injury in almost two-thirds of all cases.
Due to a large number of patients who receive NSAIDs, combined antiplatelet therapy, or long use anticoagulants, GIT injury prevention becomes an actual problem.
Treatment for NSAID enteropathy is different from that for NSAID gastropathy.  In NSAID enteropathy, it is advisable to use drugs that are able to increase the production of prostaglandins and mucus, to restore intestinal epithelial permeability, and to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
Rebamipide that produces many pleiotropic effects and also has cytoprotective properties may become the drug of choice for treating patients with NSAID enteropathy.  In addition, rebamipide has no effects on various cytochrome P-450 enzyme systems, by reducing the risk of drug interactions.
