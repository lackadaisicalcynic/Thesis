[Night sleep organization in patients with primary brain tumor].
AIM  To study cycle organization of night sleep and analyze brain electrical activity during sleep in patients with primary brain tumor before and after surgical intervention.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ten patients, mean age 48.6Â±4.2 years, with primary tumors participated in the study.
Polysomnography study was performed before and on the 7th day after surgical intervention.
RESULTS
Shot delta-sleep latency, shorter 2nd stage, disturbances of rhythmogenesis in the 2nd stage and higher delta-sleep activity were observed before and after surgical intervention.
There were changes in the brain electrical activity during delta-sleep and REM.
The changes in the first sleep cycles were noted before surgical intervention.  The greater amount of stage 2 was found after surgery.
CONCLUSION  The results can be used to correct the accompanying therapy in the early postoperative period to improve its efficacy.
