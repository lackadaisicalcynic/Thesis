[Age-related dynamics of the contents of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -9) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP-1, -2, -4) in blood plasma of residents of the European part of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation.]  Here we present the study of enzymes involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix metabolism.
It was the first study of this kind in the European part of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF).  The contents of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -9) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP-1, -2, -4) were measured in blood plasma of 91 men in AZRF (67o N) and 14 men in Western Siberia.
The contents of MMP-1, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-4 in plasma of northerners were higher compared to those of the residents of Western Siberia (55o N).
Age-related dynamics of MMP and TIMP contents had a mixed trend in northerners.
The maximum contents of MMP-1 and MMP-9 and of MMP-3 were observed in 30-39 and 40-49 years old groups, respectively.  The contents of these enzymes tended to decease with age.
The maximum contents of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 and of TIMP-4 were in 50-59 and 60-69 years old groups, respectively, while the minimum contents of these enzymes were in the group of young men up to 29 years old.
Hyaluronidase activity was minimal in 30-39 years old group and increased with age up to maximum values at 50-59 years old.
Age-related imbalance of MMP/TIMP system (MSE content reduction with age vs TIMP content increase in older age groups) can be considered one of the reasons of the identified age-related increase of interstitial fibrosis and premature aging of the northerners.
