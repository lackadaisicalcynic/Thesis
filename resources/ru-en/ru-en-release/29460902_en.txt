[The efficacy of cortexin and memantinol (memantine) in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia].
AIM
To study the dynamics of cognitive impairment in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) treated with cortexin and memantinol (memantine).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The authors present the results of the multicenter observational program 'KORMEN' that studied the efficacy of cortexin and memantinol in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with CCI.
The study included 495 patients, 204 (41.2%) men and 291 (58.8%) women.
Patients were stratified into two groups: cortexin group (n=388 (78.4%)) and cortexin + memantinol group.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A significant positive effect of treatment based on the scores on 4 cognitive scales was shown in both groups of patients.  The addition of memantinol significantly improved cognitive functions in patients with severe cognitive impairment (Ñ€<0.05).
The safety profile of the drugs was confirmed.
