[The pedagogical evaluation of the pre-school children with cochlear implants].  The objective of the present work was to elaborate the content of comprehensive psycho-pedagogical examination for the assessment of the overall intelligence level in the children presenting with hearing impairments.
The complex of studies to be carried out to achieve this purpose encompasses evaluation of the social, physical, and cognitive development of the children as well as peculiarities of their play activities, their speech and hearing abilities.
This approach is believed to enable a teacher of deaf and hard of hearing to identify the individual characteristics of each child and determine those of special importance for the elaboration of educational programs on an individual basis taking into consideration variants of children's development (harmonic, uneven, retarded, etc.).
To facilitate the implementation of the proposed method, a special electronic tool (a virtual practice for a teacher of deaf) has been created.
The virtual practice is believed to be instrumental in the training of the teachers of deaf for the comprehensive evaluation of the children with cochlear implants.  In this way, the effectiveness of the development of personalized rehabilitation programs can be substantially increased.
