[Evaluation of the pro- and antioxidant status of women with HIV or coinfection].
AIM  To reveal the specific features of changes in the parameters of lipid peroxidation - antioxidant defense and the status of the reproductive system in women of fertile age with monoinfection (HIV) or coinfection (HIV and hepatitis B and/or C).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
81 reproductive-aged women were examined and divided into 3 groups: 1) 28 apparently healthy women (controls); 2) 26 patients with HIV monoinfection; and 3) 27 patients with HIV coinfection (HIV + hepatitis B and/or C) who had not previously received antiretroviral therapy.
RESULTS
The HIV coinfection group showed the higher values of primary (conjugated dienes) and secondary (ketodienes and conjugated trienes) lipid peroxidation products in the presence of lower superoxide dismutase activity and obvious Î±-tocopherol deficiency than the control and HIV monoinfection groups.
HIV coinfection in reproductive-aged women was accompanied by the high frequency of luteal phase deficiency.
CONCLUSION
HIV coinfection is characterized by a more pronounced oxidative stress, antioxidant factor deficiency, and the high frequency of luteal phase deficiency in the patients.
