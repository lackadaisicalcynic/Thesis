[Pathogenetic effects of low-intensity laser therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AIM  To study the impact of low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) on typical pathological processes of impairments in platelet aggregation and microcirculation (MC) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A photo optical aggregatometric method was used to investigate platelet aggregation function in patients with COPD and MC was estimated by laser Doppler flowmetry over time.
RESULTS
There were muitidirectional changes in platelet aggregation function with a predominance of hyperaggregation, as well as a significant improvement in aggregation indicators during LILT; the latter was shown to have a correcting impact on MC disorders in patients with COPD in the presence of the spastic and stagnant-stasic types of MC, which were prevalent in the majority of patients.
CONCLUSION
Laser therapy used in the combination treatment of patients with COPD promotes correction of the typical pathological processes.
