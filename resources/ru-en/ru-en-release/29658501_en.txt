[Anhedonia, depression, anxiety, and craving in opioid dependent patients stabilized on oral naltrexone or naltrexone implant].  AIM
To assess the relationship between long-term naltrexone treatment and anxiety, depression and craving in opioid dependent individuals.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Opioid dependent patients (n=306) were enrolled in a three cell (102ss/cell) randomized, double blind, double dummy, placebo-controlled 6-month trial comparing extended release implantable naltrexone with oral naltrexone and placebo (oral and implant).  Monthly assessments of affective responses used a Visual Analog Scale for opioid craving, the Beck Depression Inventory, Spielberger Anxiety Inventory, and the Ferguson and Chapman Anhedonia Scales.
Between-group outcomes were analyzed using mixed model analysis of variance (Mixed ANOVA) and repeated measures and the post hoc Tukey test.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Anhedonia, depression, anxiety, and craving for opiates were elevated at baseline but gradually reduced to normal within the first 1-2 months for patients who remained in treatment and did not relapse.  There were no significant between-group differences prior to treatment dropout as well as between those who relapsed and who continued on naltrexone.
CONCLUSION  These data do not support concerns that naltrexone treatment of opioid dependence precipitates anhedonia, depression, anxiety or craving for opiates.
