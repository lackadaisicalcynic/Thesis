[Delayed coloesophagoplasty in difficult clinical situations].  AIM
To improve immediate and long-term results of delayed coloesophagoplasty in cancer patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We presented three case reports of coloesophagoplasty in difficult clinical situations including technical impossibility of primary plasty, extraordinary anesthetic situation, transplant necrosis after primary plasty.  RESULTS
Gastrointestinal tract integrity was restored in all cases and patients returned to nutrition per os, that provided good quality of life and compensated nutritional deficiencies.
Only one patient had bleeding in postoperative period that required relaparotomy.  There were no postoperative complications in two other patients.
CONCLUSION
Delayed coloesophagoplasty should be performed in all patients who underwent esophagogastrectomy if progression of primary disease is absent.  Graft placement and colic segment are chosen individually.
However left half of colon with retrosternal location of transplant is preferable for plasty.
