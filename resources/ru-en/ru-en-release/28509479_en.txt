[Study of gene expression of transcription factors T cells during aging].
The level of expression of transcription factor genes (GATA-3, TBX21, IL23A), and changing of oxidative modification of proteins in young and elderly healthy persons was studied.
The results of evaluation of gene expression, GATA-3 in lymphocytes showed the increased expression of GATA-3 in elderly people in comparison with the young.
Women demonstrated higher expression of GATA-3 in compare with men.  Study of IL-2p showed reduced levels of expression in aged humans compared to young.
TVH21 expression level showed a reduction expression in both men and women.  Comparative analysis of protein oxidation in blood plasma of young and elderly people showed an increase in the intensity of oxidative modification of proteins in the elderly.
