[Chronic tics and Tourette syndrome in children and adolescents: diagnostic and treatment characteristics].  Chronic tics (CT) are observed in 3-4% population, Tourette syndrome (TS) in 0.1-3.0%.
In most cases, tic disorders start at age 2-15 years, but frequently they are diagnosed late.  Clinical presentations of tics and comorbid disorders are various and depend on child's age.
Difficulties in treatment of CT are associated with their persistence and those for TS with the fluctuating course of tics and probable onset of the disease in the form of behavioral disorders.
Treatment of CT and TS is individual.
Methods of behavioral and psychotherapy are recommended for a certain period of time if tics do not hamper everyday life.  Increase in tick frequency and severity indicate the necessity of using pharmacological treatment.
The European recommendations on pharmacotherapy of tic disorders and the drugs available in Russia are considered.  Results of the studies on the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs and tenoten children in CT and TS are presented.
