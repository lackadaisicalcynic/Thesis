[Validation of the Russian version of the modified Addenbrooke's cognitive examination for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis].
AIM
To evaluate the validity of the Russian version of the modified Addenbrooke's cognitive examination (ACE-m) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
ACE-m and MMSE, as a comparison scale, were administered to 78 patients including 49 patients with AD and 29 healthy people.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
ACE-m demonstrated the high validity in the diagnosis of dementia in AD.  Cronbach's alpha was 0.89. ACE-m is a brief and simple in use test that measures a wide spectrum of cognitive functions, gives a general impression about cognitive deficit and diagnoses dementia in AD with the greater validity compared to MMSE.
This scale is useful not only in diagnosis of AD but also in differentiation with other causes of dementia.
