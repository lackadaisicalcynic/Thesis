[Extended endoscopic endonasal posterior (transclival) approach to tumors of the clival region and ventral posterior cranial fossa.  Part 2.
Topographic and anatomical aspects and surgical technique].
PURPOSE  to present the main topographic and anatomical features of the clivus and adjacent structures for improving and optimizing the extended endoscopic transnasal posterior (transclival) approach in removal of clival and ventral posterior cranial fossa lesions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We performed a topographic and anatomical study of 25 cadaver heads, the vascular bed of which was filled with colored silicone using the original technique for visualizing the bed features and individual variability.
RESULTS  We present the main anatomical landmarks necessary for performing the extended endoscopic endonasal posterior approach.
Superior, medial, and inferior transclival approaches provide access to the anterior surface of the upper, middle, and lower neurovascular complexes of the posterior cranial fossa.  CONCLUSION
The endoscopic transclival approach can be used to reach ventral posterior cranial fossa lesions.  The endoscopic transnasal transclival approach is an alternative to transcranial approaches to clival lesions.
