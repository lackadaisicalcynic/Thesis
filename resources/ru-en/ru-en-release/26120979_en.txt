[Experience of botulinum toxin in treatment of writer's cramp].  OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin type A (BTA) injections in patients with writer's cramp (WC).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We treated 29 patients, in general, 49 BTA injections were performed.  To determine points for the injections, we used ultrasound examination of the forearm including the time of writing.
RESULTS  Patients reported subjective improvement in 75.9% after the first injection.
Positive results as assessed with the WCRS were seen in 82.7% of the patients.  We observed muscle weakness in the hands of 17.2% of the patients.
Most of the patients were satisfied with the result of the injection and agreed on the need to re-injection when clinical effect of BTA had decreased.
CONCLUSION
To determine the indications for BTA injections in PS, an individual approach to the development of schemes of injections and calculation of dose is needed.  Treatment of BTA should be used in severe forms of WC with social significance to the patients.
