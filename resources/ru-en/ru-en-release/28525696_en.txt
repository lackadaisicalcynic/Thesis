[Age aspects of arterial stiffness in patients with hypertension].  To study age aspects of arterial stiffness we examined 130 patients with hypertension who signed protocol of informed consent to participate in research, mean age 61,7Â±14,3 years.
All the patients underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring by the standard method and were divided into four groups: 1st group - patients of young age (n=17), 2nd group - patients of middle age (n=36), 3rd - senior patients (n=52), 4th - elderly patients (n=25).
In senior and elderly patients with hypertension arterial stiffness significantly increases comparing with younger patients resulting in an increase of the index of arterial stiffness and augmentation index.
