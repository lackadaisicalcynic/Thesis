[Comparing the risks for the development of perioperative complications in carotid endarterectomy and carotid angioplasty].  The article is a literature review presenting a comparative analysis of 30-day risks of mortality and complications after carotid endarterectomy and carotid angioplasty with stenting.
The risks studied were as follows: myocardial infarction, stroke, transitory ischaemic attacks, bradycardia, hypotension, postoperative haematomas, and damages to the craniocerebral nerves.
The authors analysed a series of recently published foreign studies and meta-analyses dedicated to the problem concerned.  The obtained findings revealed that carotid endarterectomy turned out to be associated with a higher perioperative risk for the development of myocardial infarction, postoperative haematomas and damages to the craniocerebral nerves, whereas carotid angioplasty with stenting appeared to be associated with an increased risk for the development of stroke, bradycardia and hypotension within the first 30 postoperative days.
As far as mortality is concerned, it proved to be relatively similar for both methods of revascularization.
The use of systems of protection of the brain from embolism during stenting of carotid arteries decreases the perioperative risks, however, it seems difficult to unequivocally affirm which of the methods of cerebral protection demonstrates better results.
