AIM  To identify prognostic criteria of the restoration of movement in patients after acute disturbance of cerebral blood circulation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Results of clinical examination of 82 patients after the acute disturbance of blood circulation in the left hemisphere were analyzed in the Center for Speech Pathology and Neurorehabilitation.  The degree of hemiparesis was compared with disease history data, results of electroencephalography, ultrasound and transcranial dopplerography, computed tomography and biochemical study.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The volume of lesion <50 cm3 which was not located in occipital regions, the volume of lesion from 50 to 100 cm3 with the disturbance of blood circulation only in one arterial system (carotid or cerebral) and residual or moderate pathological changes in electrical activity were characteristic of favorable prognosis of rehabilitation.
Poor prognosis was associated with the volume of lesion >100 cm3 with concomitant disturbance of blood circulation in two arterial systems (both carotid and cerebral), marked and moderate pathological changes in electrical activity and the occipital localization of the lesion regardless of its volume.
