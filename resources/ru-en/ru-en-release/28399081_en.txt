[The morphological changes in the male sexual glands associated with the craniocerebral injury].  The objective of the present work was to study the structure of the male sexual glands in 5 patients who died within 21 days after the craniocerebral injury and in 6 other subjects who died from a similar injury at the site of the event.
The conventional histological and morphometric methods were used for the purpose.  It was shown that all structural components of the sexual gland undergo strong atrophic changes that are especially well pronounced in the epithelial spermatogenic layer.
Generally speaking , these changes can be described as 'motley atrophy of the sexual glands' that turns into germinal aplasia having the transitory character.
