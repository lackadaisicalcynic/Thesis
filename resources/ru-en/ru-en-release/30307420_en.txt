[Why should we refuse simple suturing of duodenal ulcer complicated by perforation?]
AIM
To determine the role of simple suturing of perforated duodenal ulcer.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 170 patients with perforated duodenal ulcer.  Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 - 40 patients who underwent simple closure of the ulcer; group 2 - 130 patients who underwent Judd pyloroplasty with ulcerative defect excision.
Abdominal effusion nature and severity of peritonitis were comparable in both groups.
RESULTS
Mortality was significantly higher in group of simple suturing of ulcerative defect.
CONCLUSION
Simple closure of perforated duodenal ulcers should be discarded.
