[Morphological and clinical aspects of anterior capsulotomy in femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery].  The review covers morphological and clinical aspects of femtosecond laser-assisted anterior capsulotomy in cataract surgery.
Literature data suggests that femtosecond laser-assisted capsulotomy is more accurate in size, shape, and centration than manual.
Femtosecond laser-assisted anterior capsulotomy improves the accuracy of IOL positioning within the capsular bag.
