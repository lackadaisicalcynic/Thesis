[Temporomandibular disorder as the most prevalent cause of facial pain: current evidence].
Orofacial pain is a comprehensive and multi-faceted syndrome.  After dental causes have been excluded, neurologists are challenged to diagnose the cause of pain.
The paper gives a detailed review of one of the most common causes of facial pain - temporomandibular disorder (TMD).
Current DC/TMD diagnostic criteria, patient examination protocols and a new perspective on TMD pathophysiology based on the recent neurological studies are presented.
The article also discusses modern approaches to TMD management.
