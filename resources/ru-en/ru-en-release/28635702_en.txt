[Laparoscopic adhesiolysis and prevention of abdominal adhesions by using mechanical barriers].  Adhesions commonly result from abdominal and pelvic surgical procedures and may result in intestinal obstruction, infertility, chronic pain, or complicate subsequent operations.
Laparoscopy produces less peritoneal trauma than does conventional laparotomy and may result in decreased adhesion formation.
We present a review of the available data on laparoscopy and adhesion formation, as well as laparoscopic adhesiolysis.  We also review current adjuvant techniques that may be used by practicing laparoscopists to prevent adhesion formation.
