[Endoscopic interventions in diagnosis and treatment of Mirizzi syndrome].
AIM
To define the role of endoscopic interventions in diagnosis and treatment of Mirizzi syndrome.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Results of treatment of 41 patients with Mirizzi syndrome are presented.  Endoscopic transpapillary interventions including cholangiography, papillosphincterotomy lithoextraction, nazobiliary drainage were used as a first step in all cases.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In 4 cases laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed after biliary tree sanitation.
In 6 advanced age patients with severe comorbidities common bile duct stenting alone was preferred.
Open interventions were performed in 15 patients (36.6%) including cholecystectomy, choledocholithotomy with common bile duct drainage.
CONCLUSION
It is shown that endoscopic transpapillary methods of diagnosis and treatment of Mirizzi syndrome provides adequate decompression and sanitation of the bile ducts in most cases and significantly reduces number of open surgical procedures.
