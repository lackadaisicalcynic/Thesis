[The study of the membrane-protective potential of the combination of 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-succinate and citicoline].
AIM
To assess the changes in the composition of plasma phospholipids in patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease treated with neuroprotectors 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate (neurox) and citicoline (neipilept), the natural metabolites involved in biochemical processes in the body, and their composition.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 40 patients, 18 men and 22 women, aged from 54 to 72 years, with chronic cerebrovascular disease at the decompensation stage complicated with the hypertensive crisis and/or arrhythmia.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
During extraction of phospholipids from blood cells, a significant decrease in the amount of total lipids was found to the end of treatment of patients who received neurox or neipilept or their combination.  The study of quantitative composition of phospholipids showed no significant changes in patients treated with neurox, while the use of citicoline or combination of citicoline with 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate resulted in the increase of their total mass.
There were no significant changes in the qualitative composition of phospholipid classes in blood plasma in patients treated with neurox.  In patients treated with neipilept or with the combination of citicoline with 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate, plasma phosphatidylcholine was significantly increased.
No significant changes in the content of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin were observed.
