[Neurotropic, anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties of hopantenic acid: a chemoinformatic analysis of its molecule].
Hopantenic acid is a well-known nootropic drug similar in its chemical structure to pantothenic acid (vitamin B5).  Neurotropic effects of hopantenic acid act through binding with delta- and kappa opioid receptors, modulation of acetylcholine secretion and relationship with dopamine receptors.
Besides neurotropic effects, hopantenic acid may modulate the metabolism of prostaglandins, steroids and have antitumor effects.
