[Analysis of the clinical efficiency of eradication therapy in patients with coronary heart disease associated with gastroduodenal pathology].
AIM  To comparatively analyze the clinical efficiency of eradiation therapy (ET) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) concurrent with gastroduodenal pathology (GDP).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study was conducted in three steps.
In Step 1, 1588 patients with chronic CHD were examined.
In Step 2, the characteristics of the course of CHD concurrent with Helicobacter pylori-associated GDP in 147 patients with these conditions compared to the same number of CHD patients without GDP.
In Step 3, the impact of a GDP treatment option on the efficiency of treatment was investigated in the patients with CHD.
Group 1 received ET + basic therapy (BT); Group 2 used antisecretory therapy + BT; Group 3 consisted of CHD patients without concomitant GDP who received BT only.
The time course of changes in clinical and quality-of-life (QOL) indicators was assessed.
RESULTS
The patients with CHD concurrent with GDP have a more severe course of the disease as manifested by deterioration in clinical status and QOL.
After ET, anginal attack rates were decreased by 62.6% in Group 1, by 30.7% in Group 2 (during antisecretory therapy), and by 29.5% in Group 3.
The level of physical QOL increased by 23.7% in Group 1, which was not observed in Groups 2 and 3.
CONCLUSION
Inclusion of ET in an algorithm for treating CHD patients with GDP promotes the angina stability and normalizes QOL in the patients.
