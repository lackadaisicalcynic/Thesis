[Differential diagnostics and the treatment strategy for the management of the nasopharyngeal cystic lesions].  The nasopharyngeal cystic lesions are quite common (affecting up to 14% of the general population) even though the majority of the cases are asymptomatic.
Sometimes this condition is associated with the obstruction of nasal breathing, runny nose, hearing impairment, and other non-specific clinical manifestations.
The endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity allows the preliminary clinical diagnosis to be established, however, MRI and CT visualization are necessary for more reliable differential diagnostics of this pathology and adequate planning of its treatment.
The nasopharyngeal cysts require the surgical treatment, with endoscopic transnasal marsupialization in the combination with coblation, radiowave or laser irradiation being the main currently available option.
