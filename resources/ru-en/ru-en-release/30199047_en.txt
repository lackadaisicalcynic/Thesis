[Combined treatment of colorectal cancer followed by metastatic liver injury].  AIM
To increase the effectiveness of treatment of colorectal cancer followed by metastatic liver lesion.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
This study included 319 patients with colorectal cancer and metastatic liver lesion Gennari grade I, II, and III for the period from 2002 to 2017.
All patients received combined treatment. 107 patients underwent liver resections: right-sided hemihepatectomy - 10, advanced right-sided hemihepatectomy - 7, left-sided hemihepatectomy - 9, triple segmentectomy - 33, bisegmentectomy - 29, segmentectomy - 19 cases.
Radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases was performed in 105 patients.
Cool tip device with a power of 200 W was used for destruction.
Fifty-seven patients underwent microwave destruction of liver tumor (AveCure MWG 881, 34 W).
Transarterial chemoembolization by doxorubicin and HepaSpheres 150-250 ng was applied in 34 patients.
RESULTS
Annual, 2-, 3- and 5-year survival was 83.1%, 73.5%, 60.2% and 24.6%, respectively after liver resection.
RFA of liver metastases was followed by annual, 2- and 3-year survival near 73.5%, 53.3% and 32.1%, respectively.
In case of MWA of liver metastases annual survival was 78.5%, 2-year - 63.3%, 3-year - 58.3%.
CONCLUSION
Chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy, radiofrequency and microwave ablation is able to increase resectability up to 35-40% in patients with colorectal cancer followed by liver metastases.
Minimally invasive procedures (RFA, MWA) reduce surgical risk in critically ill patients.
