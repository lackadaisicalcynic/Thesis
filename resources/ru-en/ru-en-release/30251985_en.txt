[Dimebon correction of changes in phospholipid composition induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in experement].
AIM
To investigate the ability of the neuroprotector dimebon to prevent alterations in brain lipid metabolism caused byTNF-α.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The ability of dimebon (2,8-Dimethyl-5-[2-(6-methyl-3-pyridinyl)ethyl]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole hydrochloride) to prevent alterations in brain lipid metabolism caused byTNF-α was studied in 65 male mice (20+2g weight).
TNF-α (10 mkg/mouse), dimebon (0.2 mg/kg) and their combination were injected intraperitoneally.  Thirty min, 2, 4 and 24 h after injection, lipid level alterations in total fractions and molecular species of phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and phosphatidylethanolamine) were measured with mass-spectrometry in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
After injection of TNF-α into mice, there are significant changes in the level of all tested phospholipids.
Dimebon at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg alone does not cause any changes in the content of all tested phospholipids, but injected together with TNF-α prevents cytokine induced alterations in the lipid content.
The selectivity of TNF-α and dimebon influence on certain molecular species of various phospholipids in different parts of mouse brain is found.
The presented data suggest protective properties of dimebon preventing the development of proinflammatory syndrome induced by TNF-α in the animal brain.
