[The influence of hyperhomocysteinemia on monoaminoergic systems of hypothalamus and hippocampus of female rats at aging].
The data presented have shown the different effect of hyperhomocysteinemia (induced by 0,12-0,15 mg of methionine loading per os during 30 days) on monoamines content in hypothalamus and hippocampus of young (6-7 month) and old (20-22 month) female rats.
It has been established that the level of catecholamines (noradrenaline, dopamine), 5 oxitryptamine and 5 oxyindolacetic acid in hypothalamic areas responsible for synthesis and secretion of gonadoliberin (medial preoptic area and medial eminence with arcuate nuclei) is considerable less in old animals compared with young ones.
These data are in agreement with the low content of gonadoliberin found by us in medial eminence with arcuate nuclei.  It has been also shown the decreased level of monoamines level in hippocampus of old rats, which does not depend on methionine loading.
However in hippocampus of young animals hyperhomocysteinemia induced a noticeable reduction of noradrenaline and 5 oxyindolacetic acid, which can lead to weakening of animal's cognitive function.
