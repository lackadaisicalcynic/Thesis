[The role of 3D-CT in surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: post-processing and tissue volume calculation].  AIM
To define the indications for pancreatoduodenectomy using 3D CT-imaging, to calculate the volume of damaged and intact tissues and to determine type of surgery depending on severity of disease in case of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Retrospective analysis of CT-scans of 30 patients with ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma was performed.  In groups 1 and 2 by 15 patients total pancreatectomy and pancreatoduodenectomy were made respectively.
All patients underwent contrast-enhanced CT examination (Brilliance iCT, Phillips) followed post-processing on Brilliance Workspace Portal platform.
All data were assessed by two reviewers.
RESULTS
In group 1 CT volume of the tumor was 24±19 cm3 (32% of total pancreas), in group 2 - 9.8±6 cm3 (16% of total pancreas).
CT-volume of celiacomesenteric arteries and portal system was 25.8±10 mm/59.5±18.9 mm and 23.3±6/49.9±14.7 mm in groups 1 and 2 respectively.
Greater volume of tumor was significantly associated with increased portal system (p<0.03).
Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of determining of tumor location were increased up to 94%, 50% and 80% respectively in group 1.
There were no cases of wrong localization in group 2.
Data of both reviewers were similar.
CONCLUSION
Total pancreatectomy is advisable for pancreatic adenocarcinoma if its volume is over 31.8% of total pancreas according to 3D CT-scans.
3D-modeling improves preoperative assessment of resectability, accuracy of determining of tumor localization and identifying vascular invasion.
