[Correlation of psychoemotional status and adaptation to complete dentures].
Patients with full adentia are characterized by the formation of specific psycho-emotional status.
Rational psychotherapeutic support of these patients largely determines the efficiency of dental prosthetic treatment.
At the same time, the definition of mental and emotional status is not included in the diagnostic examination protocol.
Considering the above the purpose of the study was to evaluate mental and emotional status of patients receiving complete dentures.
Prosthetic rehabilitation of 30 patients with complete teeth loss was performed and clinical evaluation and evaluation of mental and emotional status were carried out before and after treatment.
Patients with negative experiences of prosthetics showed a higher level of personal and situational anxiety.
There was correlation of adaptation to removable dentures and the patient's personality traits.
It is determined that emotional instability during treatment tends to decrease affecting the timing of adaptation to complete dentures.
It is noted that patients with repeated prosthetics have earlier recovery of coordination ability of the masticatory muscles.
