[Telmisartan in the treatment of hypertensive patients].  The paper highlights the use of telmisartan, one of the currently available angiotensin receptor blockers, for the treatment of patients with hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and those at high cardiovascular risk.
Telmisartan treatment allows blood pressure control, provides organ protection at different stages of the cardiovascular continuum, and reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases and death.
The additional properties and pleiotropic activity of the drug determines its wide range of applications in cardiology.
