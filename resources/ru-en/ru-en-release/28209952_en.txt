[Functional results of digestive tract reconstruction after gastrectomy].
AIM
To substantiate and to prove the advantages of the new method of gastroplasty in comparison with traditional loop reconstruction of digestive tract after gastrectomy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was performed prospective comparative study of surgical treatment of 431 patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy with different variants of digestive tract reconstruction.  The main group (146 patients) consisted of patients in whom original technique including establishment of food reservoir in initial jejunal part during reconstruction was applied.
The control group consisted of patients with traditional loop reconstruction of the digestive tract (285 patients).
RESULTS
Early dumping syndrome (within 1 year) was diagnosed in 9 (13.2%) patients of the main group and 16 (21.6%) patients of the control group.  Mild and moderate degrees of this syndrome were observed in 7 (77.8%) and 10 (62.5%), 2 (22.2%) and 4 (25.0%) patients in the main and control groups respectively.  Severe dumping syndrome occurred in 2 (12.5%) patients only in the control group.
Late dumping syndrome was revealed in 7 (10.3%) and 11 (14.9%) patients, respectively.
Body mass index was 18.7±0.8 and 17.4±0.6 (p<0.05), respectively.
After 2 years early dumping syndrome was diagnosed in 6 (14.3%) and 10 (21.3%) patients, mild degree in 5 (83.3%) and 5 (50.0%) patients; moderate degree in 1 (16.7%) and 3 (30.0%).  Severe dumping syndrome was confirmed in 2 (20.0%) patients from the control group.
Late dumping syndrome occurred in 4 (9.5%) and 7 (14.9%), respectively.
Body mass index was 21.2±0.7 and 19.0±0.9 (p<0.05), respectively.
After 3 years, early dumping syndrome in mild form was diagnosed in 2 (10.5%) cases and late syndromy in 1 (5.3%) patient of the main group.  There were 5 (21.7%) patients with the syndrome in the control group including mild and moderate severity in 3 (60.0%) and 2 (40.0%) patients respectively.  Late dumping syndrome occurred in 3 (13.0%) patients.
Body mass index was 21.9±1.0 and 19.7±0.6 respectively.
CONCLUSION
Food reservoir in the initial part of jejunum after gastrectomy creates better conditions for the normalization of metabolic exchange resulting early functional digestive adaptation, especially in long-term period.
