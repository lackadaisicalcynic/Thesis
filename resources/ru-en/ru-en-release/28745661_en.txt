[n.s.i.n.i.V. Biomechanical aspects of anterior capsulotomy in cataract surgery].  This paper reviews studies on biomechanical properties of the anterior lens capsule.
Early experiments in this field were more fundamental.
Later studies were aimed mainly at assessing the mechanical stability of the capsule edge after manual or femtosecond laser capsulorhexis (capsulotomy) - an important step in modern minimally invasive phaco surgery.
For biomechanical tests, ex vivo samples of human and animal anterior capsules were used.  The results of the studies presented here are quite heterogeneous, which suggests the necessity of gaining further insight into the issue.
