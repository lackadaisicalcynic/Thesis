[Age reactivity of the organism of patients for treating bone limits.]  The purpose of the study is to find out how reducing the reactivity of the organism in patients of different age groups affects the duration of treatment of fractures of the Shin bones.
The Analyzed data 1 382 case histories of patients of different age with fractures of the tibia in the treatment by Ilizarov for the past 42 years.
Instrumental in the process of treatment in 98 patients with fractures of Shin bones the studied indicators of muscle strength, oxygen tension in the tissues, the load on the limb, micromotion of bone fragments, the speed of regional blood flow and blood flow in the middle cerebral artery.
In elderly patients an increase in terms of fixation of fragments of bones, decreased muscle strength, the load on the limb when walking, speed of cerebral blood flow and blood supply of the limb.
It is shown that the increase in terms of fixing a bone caused not so much by the number of years lived, as the deterioration of the reactivity of the organism of patients of retirement age.
