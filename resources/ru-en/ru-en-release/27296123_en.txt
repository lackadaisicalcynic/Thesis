[Repeated endoscopic hemostasis as an alternative to surgical treatment of patients with gastroduodenal ulcerative bleeding].  AIM
To define the role of endoscopic hemostasis in treatment of gastroduodenal ulcers complicated by bleeding.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of endoscopic hemostasis in 770 patients with peptic ulcers were analyzed.
RESULTS
Injection hemostasis had the highest efficacy in case of recurrent bleeding.
No other method showed significant advantage in its efficiency.  The efficacy of injection method was 52%, argon-plasma coagulation - 83.3%, radiowave technique - 78%, combined endoscopic method Â - 96%.
In case of recurrent bleeding endoscopic hemostasis is effective alternative to surgery especially in high-risk patients.  Repeated endoscopic hemostasis significantly decreases mortality from 45% to 23% in case of recurrent bleeding.
