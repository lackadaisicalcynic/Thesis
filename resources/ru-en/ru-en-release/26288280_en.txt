[Photosensitivity, epilepsy, the occipital and frontal cortex].  This article discusses the features of the structural-functional organization of the visual distance perception which, in contrast to other distant sensory systems, has not only afferent but also efferent part--the frontal visual field and, smooth and stripy muscles of the eye which accordingly support the visual function.
The increasing importance of the efferent component of the visual system in the present conditions of real and virtual movements of visual objects is shown.
The case of photosensitivity in epilepsy proves the fact that the efferent component of the visual system can react in a protective way to the rhythmic photostimulation.
