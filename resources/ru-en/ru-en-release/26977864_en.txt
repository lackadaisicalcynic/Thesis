[Comparison of Doppler-assisted dearterialization with mucopexy and hemorrhoidectomy].  AIM
To compare two methods of hemorrhoid treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  This prospective study included 240 patients with hemorrhoids stage III-IVA.
Stages III and IVA were diagnosed in 156 (65%) and 84 (35%) patients respectively.
Randomization was performed using envelopes method in one to one distribution.
In group 1 (n=120) Doppler-assisted dearterialization of internal hemorrhoids with mucopexy was performed (DDM), in group 2 (n=120) - hemorrhoidectomy using harmonic scalpel (HE).
RESULTS
Duration of surgery was 17.9±6.1 and 34.5±10.1 minutes in DDM and HE groups respectively (p<0.01).
Postoperative pain severity was higher in group 2  (4.8 compared with 2.5 scores of the first group (p<0.01).
Narcotic analgesics were used less often in DDM group  (1.3 doses compared with 6.1 doses in HE group (p<0.01).
Disability period was 14.4±5.2 and 30.3±5.4 days in both groups respectively (p<0.01).
Immediate postoperative complications occurred in 9 (7.5%) and 19 (15.8%) patients of DDM and HE groups respectively.
Recurrent prolapse of internal hemorrhoids was diagnosed in 2 (1.7%) patients of the 1st group in terms of up to 45 days.
CONCLUSION
DDM is reliable minimally invasive method of hemorrhoids stage III-IVA treatment and has similar efficacy with HE.  DDM reduces postoperative pain severity, hospital stay and disability period.
