The sustainable development goals as a framework to combat health-sector corruption.
Corruption is diverse in its forms and embedded in health systems worldwide.
Health-sector corruption directly impedes progress towards universal health coverage by inhibiting people's access to quality health services and to safe and effective medicines, and undermining systems for financial risk protection.
Corruption is also a cross-cutting theme in the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) which aim to improve population health, promote justice and strong institutions and advance sustainable human development.
To address health-sector corruption, we need to identify how it happens, collect evidence on its impact and develop frameworks to assess the potential risks and put in place protective measures.  We propose that the SDGs can be leveraged to develop a new approach to anti-corruption governance in the health sector.
The aim will be to address coordination across the jurisdictions of different countries and foster partnerships among stakeholders to adopt coherent policies and anti-corruption best practices at all levels.
Combating corruption requires a focused and invigorated political will, better advocacy and stronger institutions.
There is no single solution to the problem.  Nevertheless, a commitment to controlling corruption via the SDGs will better ensure the integrity of global health and human development now and beyond 2030.
