[The social pressing of self-destroyer stigma: a medic–æ-sociological study].
AIM  To explore the characteristics of social pressure of suicide-associated stigma for the development of preventive and destigmatization measures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
By the medico-sociological method were interviewed 1255 persons: 65 psychiatrists at the age of 23 to 80 years; 402 nurses and 437 ward attendants working in mental hospitals, and 351 people of the general population of the Belgorod region.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Significant differences were discovered in personal, intimate, family and other fields.  Those, who committed suicide attempt, were exposed to the greatest obstruction in political, administrative and professional spheres.
It was found that 80% of psychiatrists and half of nurses had enough knowledge about suicidal behavior.  Ward attendants, contrary to expectations, stigmatized those who committed suicide attempt the same, or even more, as in the general population.
The results of the study are very important for personal, social and health education among the population.  Suicidology should be included into the educational programs for psychiatrists, nurses and paramedical staff as well.
These measures will humanize the attitude of the general public toward persons who committed suicide attempts.
