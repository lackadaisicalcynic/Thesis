[European Registry on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection (Hp-EuReg protocol): The first results of Russian centers].
AIM  To assess the clinical practice of diagnosis and treatment in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and to compare this practice with the international guidelines in the European Registry on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection, Hp-EuReg protocol), a multicenter prospective observational study initiated by the European Helicobacter and Microbiota Study Group.
MATERIALs AND METHODS: The data of 813 patients infected with H. pylori and entered in the Hp-EuReg register by the Russian centers in 2013-2015 were analyzed.
RESULTS
The most common methods for the primary diagnosis of H. pylori infection are histology (40.3%), rapid urease test (35.7%), and serology (17.2%).
The duration of H. pylori eradication therapy was 7, 10, and 14 days in 18.0, 49.3, and 25.1%, respectively.
To monitor the effectiveness of treatment, the investigators used a histological examination (34%), a urea breath test (27.3%), H. pylori stool antigen (22.8%), and a rapid urease test (16.3%).
A serological test was carried out in 2.5% of the cases.
No monitoring was done in 13.5% of the patients.
The average eradication efficiency was 82.6%.  If the therapy was ineffective, 80% of physicians did not intend to prescribe a new cycle of treatment.
CONCLUSION
Significant differences were found between clinical practice and the current guidelines.
