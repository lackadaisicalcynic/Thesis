[Interrelation of rates of a biological aging with neurophysiological features at patients with professional neurointoxications].
In the hospital conducted studying of functional activity of a brain of patients with professional neurointoxications for the purpose of detection of neurophysiological features of formation of the accelerated rates of biological aging at the working, being affected neurotoxicant is carried out.
During the research it is shown that rates of aging at patients with professional neurointoxications on average in 85% of cases have premature character.  The general signs of defeat of structures of a brain at professional intoxication are defined by mercury irrespective of a disease stage at the accelerated biological aging.
For toxic impacts on a nervous system the characteristic, uniting sign distinguishing from the accelerated rates of aging of other etiology is the indicator characterizing augmentation of a latence of peak of P2 of the visual caused potentials.  Based on the analysis of the received correlations it is set that in case of professional neurointoxications permanent disorganization of the functional activity of a brain in the form of cortical and subcortical violations of sensor regulatory systems of a brain is a consequence of chronic influence of vapors of metal mercury and a complex of toxic substances and the reason of the accelerated biological aging.
