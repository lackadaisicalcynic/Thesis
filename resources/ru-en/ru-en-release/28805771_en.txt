[Synergistic application of zinc and vitamin C to support memory, attention and the reduction of the risk of the neurological diseases].
Zinc and vitamin C supplementation of the body is important for CNS functioning.  Zinc ions are involved in the neurotransmission (signal transmission from acetylcholine, catecholamine, serotonin, prostaglandin receptors) and in ubiquitin-related protein degradation.
Zinc deficits are associated with Alzheimer's disease and depression.
Zinc supplementation (10-30 mg daily) improves neurologic recovery rate in patients with stroke and brain injury, has a positive impact on memory and reduces hyperactivity in children.
Vitamin C, a zinc synergist, maintains antioxidant resources of the brain, synaptic activity and detoxification.
Vitamin C in dose 130-500 mg daily should be used to prevent dementia and neurodegenerative pathology.
