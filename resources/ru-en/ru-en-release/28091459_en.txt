[Evaluation of reparative osteogenesis of distraction regenerate of the fourth metatarsal bone in patients with brachymetatarsia].  AIM
To evaluate reparative osteogenesis of the fourth metatarsal bone using X-ray and ultrasonic methods.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Six patients with fourth metatarsal bone dysplasia underwent ultrasound and X-ray examination during distraction and fixation.
Data were analyzed.
RESULTS
During distraction sonography assessed adequately the length of elongation, activity of bone trabecula formation, features of vascularization and organotypic reconstruction of regenerate.
X-ray examination is advisable to determine the terms of device relief during fixation.
CONCLUSION
Sonography is preferable during distraction for dynamic monitoring of reparative osteogenesis.
X-ray examination is advisable to determine the terms of device relief during fixation.
