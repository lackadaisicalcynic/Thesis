[The experience with the application of a lyophilized xenodermograft for the treatment of the patients suffering from frequently recurring inflammation of the maxillary sinus in combination with alveolar fistula].  The objective of the present study was to summarize the data of the special literature concerning methods of the surgical treatment of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis complicated by the alveolar fistula with the purpose of using them for the improvement of the effectiveness of the treatment of the patients presenting with this pathology.
The study group was comprised of 39 patients with odontogenic diseases of paranasal sinuses and alveolar fistulas.  The alveolar fistulas were closed in 20 patients by means of plastic surgery with the use of a lyophilized xenodermograft prepared from the pig's skin.
Not a single case of relapse of the inflammatory process in the maxillary sinuseswas documented within one year after the treatment by means of the closure of the alveolar fistula using the lyophilizedxenodermografts.
