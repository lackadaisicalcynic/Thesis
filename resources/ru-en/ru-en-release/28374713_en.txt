[The influence of 'potassium orotate' on neocollagenogenesis in implantation of polypropylene endoprosthesis and polypropylene combined with polylactic acid endoprosthesis].  AIM
To study neocollagenogenesis after implantation of polypropylene endoprosthesis and polypropylene combined with polylactic acid endoprosthesis on background of «potassium orotate» administration.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  We used two different types of endoprosthesis in the experiment.
The first type was made of just polypropylene, the second type was made of polypropylene combined with polylactic acid.  Histological examination was performed using polarizing microscopy.
Collagen types I and III ratio in connective tissue around the prosthesis was analyzed according to the color that was individual for each type.  RESULTS
The results were significantly better in case of collagenogenesis stimulation with Potassium orotate within 30 days and later for one type of endoprosthesis.  Also we revealed that collagenogenesis and paraprosthesis capsule formation were more active in case of combined endoprosthesis.
We revealed stimulating action of «Potassium Orotate» for collegenogenesis process, this fact was proved by increased collagen I/III ratio.  CONCLUSION
Optimization of collagenogenesis was based on persistent 1,37-fold increase of collagen I/III ratio in case of combined endoprosthesis after 90 days.  It was manifested by accelerated formation of connective tissue capsule and facilitated early isolation of the implant from surrounding tissues.
