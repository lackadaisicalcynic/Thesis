[Analysis of security by vitamin D of the elderly people.]  The purpose of the study was to analyze the frequency of detection of vitamin D deficiency in elderly people, identify clinically significant diseases, accompanied by a deficiency of vitamin 25(OH)D.  A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 506 patients over 65 years of age (74,1±6,5 years).
Patients were divided into three age groups: group A 65-74 years, group B 75-84 years, group C 85 years and older.
The study of blood samples was carried out from September to May.
The level of vitamin 25(OH)D was determined by the method of chemiluminescent immunoassay on the Abbott Architect 8000 analyzer (USA).
Evaluation of vitamin 25(OH)D was performed according to the clinical recommendations of the Russian Endocrinology Association and the recommendations of the Russian Association for Osteoporosis.
Among people older than 65 years, the average level of 25(OH)D was 20,9 ng/ml (range 2,3 to 70,5 ng/ml), 50% had vitamin D deficiency.
With age, the proportion of patients with vitamin D deficiency increased more in the male population.
Low values of vitamin 25(OH)D were more frequent in the spring.
Arterial hypertension, obesity of varying degrees, sarcopenia increased the risk of vitamin D deficiency in 1,15-1,17-1,2 (р<0,05-0,01) times, respectively.
Oncological diseases in the anamnesis were accompanied by low parameters of vitamin 25(OH)D in blood serum (p=0,084).
