[Atropine use for progressive myopia in children and adolescents].  The worldwide prevalence of myopia varies within the range of 20-50% among the adult population of Europe and the United States reaching 60-90% in Asian countries.
Reduction of pediatric myopia rates is an important task of medicine.
From many reported conservative methods for stabilization of myopia, those that involve pharmaceutical measures are worth paying attention to.
This review covers publications dated 1964 or later that contain the results of atropine use at different concentrations in children and adolescents with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years.
Atropine mechanisms of action and side effects at different concentrations of the drug are also analyzed.
The authors point out potential health hazards for patients on atropine therapy.  The principal conclusion: low-dose atropine (0.01%) makes a good compromise between potential negative effects and statistically significant slowing of myopia progression proved in numerous studies.
It is recommended that children at the age of 8-13 years undergo at least a 2-year course of atropine therapy.
