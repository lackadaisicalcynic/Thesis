[The frequency of cerebrovascular disorders in patients with different forms of atrial fibrillation].
AIM  To study the frequency of blood circulation disorders (BCD) in patients with different forms of atrial fibrillation (AF) and its relationship with AF duration and treatment with anticoagulants.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Medical records and medical history of 1626 patients with non-valvural AF were analyzed in Moscow from 2009 to 2015.
RESULTS
Patients with persistent AF were older and had a higher risk of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications.
In the group of patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF, percentage of patients with BCD (including recurrent ones) was decreased by 13.1 and 28.9% compared to the patients with persistent form.
There was no correlation between AF duration and BCD frequency.  The frequency of using anticoagulants was 10.8% in outpatients and 42.8% in inpatients.
Patients with persistent AF received anticoagulants less frequently than patients with less persistent forms.  CONCLUSION
Persistent AF is associated with the higher risk of BCD.  The prevention of BCD in patients with persistent AF was insufficient compared to that in patients with less persistent forms.
