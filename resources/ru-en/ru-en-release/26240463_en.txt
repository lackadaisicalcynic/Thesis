Applying the lessons of maternal mortality reduction to global emergency health.
Over the last few decades, maternal health has been a major focus of the international community and this has resulted in a substantial decrease in maternal mortality globally.
Although, compared with maternal illness, medical and surgical emergencies account for far more morbidity and mortality, there has been less focus on global efforts to improve comprehensive emergency systems.
The thoughtful and specific application of the concepts used in the effort to decrease maternal mortality could lead to major improvements in global emergency health services.  The so-called three-delay model that was developed for maternal mortality can be adapted to emergency service delivery.
Adaptation of evaluation frameworks to include emergency sentinel conditions could allow effective monitoring of emergency facilities and further policy development.  Future global emergency health efforts may benefit from incorporating strategies for the planning and evaluation of high-impact interventions.
