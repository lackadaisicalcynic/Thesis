[Current approaches to management of patients with mild cognitive impairment].  Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia.
The prevalence of MCI among elderly people is 12-17% but the risk of progression of cognitive impairment and development of dementia during 5 years is up to 70%.
Cerebral vascular diseases and initial stages of neurodegenerative processes are the cause of MCI.  Clinical characteristics of MCI depend on the main etiological factor.
To decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent the progression of cognitive impairment in MCI patients, pharmacotherapy and non-medication methods, including diet optimization, stimulation of mental and physical activity, are used.
Dopaminergic and noradrenergic therapy is most prevalent among pharmacological methods.
