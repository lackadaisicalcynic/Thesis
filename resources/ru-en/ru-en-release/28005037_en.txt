[A case of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in a HIV-infected female patient].  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC virus is a severe central nervous lesion developing in the presence of obvious immunodeficiency.
In most cases, the disease results in a fatal outcome within a few months.
Antiretroviral therapy is currently considered to be the only method for the prevention and treatment of PML in HIV-infected patients.
The paper describes a positive experience in treating the HIV-infected female patient with the established diagnosis of PML.
