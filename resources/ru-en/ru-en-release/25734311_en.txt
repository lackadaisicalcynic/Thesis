[The possibilities for the treatment of exudative otitis media in the children presenting with chronic adenoiditis].  The objective of the present study was to improve the effectiveness of medicamental therapy of exudative otitis media in the children with recurrent and chronic adenoiditis.
It was shown that the use of fluifort (carbocysteine lysine salt) for the treatment of exudative otitis media in the children presenting with chronic adenoiditis is a more effective approach in comparison with the expectant management.
It is concluded that the application of carbocysteine lysine salt in combination with the mometasone furoate nasal spray ensures the rapid elimination of the symptoms of adenoiditis and significantly accelerates the resolution of exudative otitis media compared with the monotherapeutic treatment.
