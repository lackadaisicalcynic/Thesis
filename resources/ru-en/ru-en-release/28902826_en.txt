[Treatment of type IB endoleak after endoprosthetic repair of infrarenal aneurysm].  The article deals with a case report regarding successful surgical management of late type IB endoleak caused by dislocation of the leg of the stent graft, occurring three years after endoprosthetic repair of an aneurysm of the aortic infrarenal portion with the COOK stent graft, aneurysmectomy with prosthetic repair of the right common femoral artery using the linear vascular graft Intergard 8Ð§20.
The patient underwent surgical treatment: endoprosthetic repair of the iliac branch ZSLE-24-90-90 ZT of the Zenith Spiral AAA stent graft.
The findings of the check-up angiography and ultrasonographic examination revealed no evidence of endoleak, with the stent graft's patency preserved.
The early postoperative period was marked with moderate manifestations of asthenic syndrome.
The patient was discharged in a satisfactory condition.
Cases concerning removal of similar complication in the remote period following endoprosthetic repair of the aorta are mentioned sporadically in the available literature.
