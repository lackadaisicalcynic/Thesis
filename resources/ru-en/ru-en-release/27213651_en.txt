[Paraganglioma of the middle ear.  The retrospective analysis of the results of the surgical treatment].
The objective of the present study was to analyze the results of and to summarize the experience with diagnostics and surgical treatment of the patients presenting with paraganglioma of the middle ear (PME).  A total of 5 patients were available for the examination (all of the women) including two in whom the extension of the tumour corresponded to class A paraganglioma (according to the classification of U. Fisch) and three with class B paraganglioma (two having the tumour that occupied mezo- and hypotympanum and one with the tumour extending into the infralabyrinthine space).
All the patients of the former group and 2 of the three in the latter group were operated with the use of the retroauricular-endomeatal approach.  The remaining patient with class B paraganglioma extending into the infralabyrinthine space and the suspected destruction of the outer wall of the internal carotid artery by the tumour or its penetration into the channel was treated with the use of the retroauricular-endomeata-transmastoidal approach.
The long-term postoperative catamnesticobservation of the thus treated patients has demonstrated the absence of a recurrent tumour within at least 3 tears after surgery.
All the patientseported he preserved hearing function.
