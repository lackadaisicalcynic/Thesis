[Hereditary afibrinogenemia: A literature review and clinical observations].  Afibrinogenemia is a rare congenital coagulopathy that leads to life-threatening bleeding.
In afibrinogenemia, plasma fibrinogen levels are less than 0.1 g/L.
The clinical manifestations of the disease can be both bleeding and thromboses of different localizations, which is determined by the multifunctional role of fibrinogen in hemostasis.
The described cases demonstrate different clinical phenotypes of the disease.
In both cases the diagnosis was confirmed by genetic examinations that revealed homozygous mutations in the fibrinogen A genes.  The nature of the mutations assumes consanguineous marriages, as confirmed by the results of a genealogical analysis.
Fibrinogen preparations are promising in treating afibrinogenemia in Russia.
