[The development of the method for enzymatic hydrolysis for the extraction of toxic substances from the hair samples].  The objective of the present study was to develop and validate the method for the extraction of toxic substances from the hair samples as exemplified by enzymatic hydrolysis of barbituric acid derivatives.
The experiments were carried out with the use of laboratory animals (white female rats and albino guinea pigs) that had been daily given a phenobarbital solution per os during 4 months preceding the study.
The hairs obtained from the experimental animals were subjected to acid hydrolysis with a 6 mole hydrochloric acid and enzymatic hydrolysis with the use of chymopsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and papain solutions.
The analysis of the extracted materials was performed by means of gas chromatography with mass-selective detection.
The application of the proposed method for enzymatic hydrolysis produced the better results than acid hydrolysis.  This technique was validated.
The results of the study made possible the comparative characteristic of the effectiveness of acid and enzymatic hydrolysis.
