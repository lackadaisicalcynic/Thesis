[The state of vegetative homeostasis in the patients presenting with ronchopathy].  The objective of the present work was the clinical and instrumental study of the vegetative nervous system in 25 patients of different age presenting with ronchopathy.
The results of the study indicate the prevalence of the vagotonic type of primary vegetative tone and the specific features of vegetative reactivity differing from those in the control subjects (n=12).
Moreover, all the patients were shown to have concomitant diseases of the upper respiratory tract.
The data obtained give evidence of vegetative disbalance in the patientspresenting with ronchopathy which makes it necessary to design and develop new methods producing the vegetostabilizing effect for the treatment of snoring during sleep to be used together with other conservative and surgical methods.
