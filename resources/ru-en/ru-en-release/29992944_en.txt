[Barrier drugs with prolonged release in dental practice].  Pathological lesions associated with multiple causes (infections, physical, chemical and thermal agents) of oral mucosa are equally widespread in all spheres of dental practice.
The actual importance of pharmaceutical therapy of lesions of oral mucosa is associated with the lack of reliable traditional topical drugs - ointments, gels, pastes, lacquers, discs - caused by their little efficiency associated with poor maintaining of permanent concentration, short contact period, discomfort and long-term treatment.
All the mentioned facts caused the development of various pharmaceutical forms with prolonged activity with improved adhesion to oral mucosa, prolonged saving of useful properties and protecting the lesion from oral infection and external influences and reducing the intensity of painful sensations during mastication and mimics.
These drugs form the group of barrier drugs and drugs with prolonged release of medicine of the wide specter.  During all the time of existence this group of drugs has undergone and is still undergoing several changes targeted on improvement of adhesion and maintaining of constant concentration of medicine in the lesion and extension of indications for use.
The development of new pharmaceutical forms is still continuing.
