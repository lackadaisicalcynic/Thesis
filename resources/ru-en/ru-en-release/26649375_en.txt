[Signaling molecules in the brain and epigenetic factors in neurodegenerative and mental disorders].  The literature on a role of signaling molecules in the organization of memory and cognitive functions is analyzed basing on mechanisms of memory physiology determined by a complex of biochemical processes initiated by the transmission of the signal to the synapse and completed by the synthesis of functionally significant molecules in the neuronal genetic apparatus.
The center of these processes is a coordinated system of signal transduction, transcription, epigenetic and neurotrophic molecules.  The dissonance of signal mechanisms is a prime cause of memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction as social maladaptation factors.
The results of experimental and clinical studies of a role of the multilevel signaling system in age-related, neurodegenerative (Alzheimerâ€™s disease) and mental (depression) disorders are discussed.
At the same time, signaling molecules may be considered as particular targets for new therapeutic approaches.
