[Efficiency of structural antigipoxants in perioperative period of patients with lower limbs fractures].  The aim of the study was to study the effectiveness of pathogenetic correction of the metabolism with the inclusion of reamberin (1.5% sodium meglumine succinate solution) in patients with lesions of large segments of the lower limbs.
In connection with the task, the efficiency pathogenetic correction of metabolism in 211 patients with diaphyseal hip and shin bones fractures had been analyzed.
Patients were divided into the main and control groups.
In the main group (86 patients), intravenous infusions of reamberin were administered intravenously at a rate of 1 ml/min at a rate of 10 ml/kg of body weight 1 time per day, a course of 10 days.  Patients in the comparison group (125 patients) received an infusion therapy with isotonic solution.
The parameters of functional activity and peripheral blood dates had been analyzed.
The analysis showed that the use of antihypoxants in the perioperative period provides an earlier recovery of the physical component of quality of life in patients with lesions of large segments of the lower limbs that have undergone stably - functional osteosynthesis according to the principles of Damage control.
