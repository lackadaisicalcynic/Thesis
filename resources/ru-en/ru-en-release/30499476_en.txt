[The role of the immunohistochemical investigations in the documentation of intravitality and severity of the gunshot injuries to the soft tissues].  The objective of the present study was to determine intravitality and severity of a gunshot-inflicted trauma making use of the immunohistochemical (IGH) methods for the evaluation of the injury to the soft tissues of the wound canal.
The immunohistochemical methods were employed to estimate the expression of fibrinogen and vimentin.
The positive immunohistochemical reaction was obtained in the fibrinogen assay whereas the reaction in the zone of necrosis was negative.  These findings give evidence of the thermal impact produced by the firearm projectile on the soft tissues.
Deformation of the cytoskeleton registered in the IGH test for vimentin suggests its disintegration and therefore the severity of the injury.
It is concluded that the investigations with the use of the immunohistochemical methods, make it possible to identify the affected parts of the wound canal.
