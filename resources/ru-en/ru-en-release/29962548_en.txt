Involving male partners in maternity care in Burkina Faso: a randomized controlled trial.
Objective
To determine whether an intervention to involve the male partners of pregnant women in maternity care influenced care-seeking, healthy breastfeeding and contraceptive practices after childbirth in urban Burkina Faso.  Methods
In a non-blinded, multicentre, parallel-group, superiority trial, 1144 women were assigned by simple randomization to two study arms: 583 entered the intervention arm and 561 entered the control arm.
All women were cohabiting with a male partner and had a low-risk pregnancy.  Recruitment took place at 20 to 36 weeks' gestation at five primary health centres in Bobo-Dioulasso.
The intervention comprised three educational sessions: (i) an interactive group session during pregnancy with male partners only, to discuss their role; (ii) a counselling session during pregnancy for individual couples; and (iii) a postnatal couple counselling session.  The control group received routine care only.
We followed up participants at 3 and 8 months postpartum.  Findings
The follow-up rate was over 96% at both times.  In the intervention arm, 74% (432/583) of couples or men attended at least two study sessions.
Attendance at two or more outpatient postnatal care consultations was more frequent in the intervention than the control group (risk difference, RD: 11.7%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 6.0 to 17.5), as was exclusive breastfeeding 3 months postpartum (RD: 11.4%; 95% CI: 5.8 to 17.2) and effective modern contraception use 8 months postpartum (RD: 6.4%; 95% CI: 0.5 to 12.3).
Conclusion
Involving men as supportive partners in maternity care was associated with better adherence to recommended healthy practices after childbirth.
