[Neurophysiological identification of the cranial nerves in endoscopic endonasal surgery of skull base tumors].  INTRODUCTION  Intraoperative identification of the cranial nerves is a useful technique in removal of skull base tumors through the endoscopic endonasal approach.
Searching through the scientific literature found one pilot study on the use of triggered electromyography (t-EMG) for identification of the VIth nerve in endonasal endoscopic surgery of skull base tumors (D. San-Juan, et al, 2014).
AIM  The study objective was to prevent iatrogenic injuries to the cranial nerves without reducing the completeness of tumor tissue resection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In 2014, 5 patients were operated on using the endoscopic endonasal approach.
Surgeries were performed for large skull base chordomas (2 cases) and trigeminal nerve neurinomas located in the cavernous sinus (3).
Intraoperatively, identification of the cranial nerves was performed by triggered electromyography using a bipolar electrode (except 1 case of chordoma where a monopolar electrode was used).
Evaluation of the functional activity of the cranial nerves was carried out both preoperatively and postoperatively.
RESULTS
Tumor resection was total in 4 out of 5 cases and subtotal (chordoma) in 1 case.
Intraoperatively, the IIIrd (2 patients), Vth (2), and VIth (4) cranial nerves were identified.
No deterioration in the function of the intraoperatively identified nerves was observed in the postoperative period.
In one case, no responses from the VIth nerve on the right (in the cavernous sinus region) were intraoperatively obtained, and deep paresis (up to plegia) of the nerve-innervated muscles developed in the postoperative period.
The nerve function was not impaired before surgery.
CONCLUSION
The t-EMG technique is promising and requires further research.
