[Law and educational components of patient's safety in surgery].  AIM
To evaluate law and educational components of patient's safety (PS) in surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In order to analyze complex causes of adverse outcomes in surgery we performed an interviewing of 110 surgeons, 42 emergency physicians and 25 health care managers.  The main keynote consisted in assessing law and educational components of PS.
RESULTS
The study revealed significant professional shortcomings in law PS level and low educational and motivational activity of physicians of all specialties.  CONCLUSION
Multi-faceted nature of PS problem requires multidisciplinary training of modern surgeons not only in the knowledge of key risk factors for adverse outcomes, but also in satisfaction of non-medical expectations of patients.  Due to numerous objective reasons Russian surgical school should have the opportunity not to blindly copy the experience of our foreign colleagues, but to scientifically substantiate the development of own national security system both for surgical patients and medical workers themselves.
