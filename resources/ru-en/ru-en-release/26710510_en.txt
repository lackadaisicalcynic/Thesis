[The approaches to the optimization of forensic medical methods employed for determining age].
The analysis of the results of investigations performed at M.I. Raisky Department of Forensic Medicine, Saratov State Medical University, to elucidate the age-specific changes in the human soft tissues made it possible to distinguish several variants of reducing errors committed in association with the determination of the age of individual subjects with the help of forensic medical methods.
At present, the chronological age is calculated with a different degree of accuracy from the data on the involution of aorta, skin, testicles, prostate and thyroid glands.
In order to enhance the accuracy of newly developed diagnostic methods, it is proposed to take into account the necessity of fulfilling the following conditions: to increase the number of characteristics of the study object to be analysed, to use the complex of involution features of several organs belonging to a single body system, and to apply the rational approach to the choice of the methods for the mathematical analysis of the data being obtained.
