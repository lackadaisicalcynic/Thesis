[A comparative analysis of the dynamics of affective symptoms in overweight patients with depression and eating disorders during treatment process].
PROBLEM RELEVANCE
Eating disorders are linked with depression in patients with high body mass index (BMI).  AIM
To evaluate the dynamics of affective symptoms in overweight patients with depression and eating disorders in the process of treatment with agomelatine.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Male (n=15) and female (n=37) overweight patients (n=52, mean age 33.67Â±2.31 years) were randomly observed.  The sample was divided into two groups.
The first group included individuals with depression and high BMI and the second with co-morbid eating disorders of bulimic type.
Patients were treated with agomelatine in average therapeutic doses.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The presence of an eating disorder significantly influences clinical symptoms of depression by reducing the speed of therapeutic effect of agomelatine.
