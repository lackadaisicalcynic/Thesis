[Peripheral refraction: cause or effect of refraction development?]  AIM
to study peripheral refraction and the shape of the eyeball in children with different clinical refraction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Using an original method, peripheral refraction was measured at 10-12 degrees temporally and nasally from the fovea in 56 right eyes with different clinical, or axial, refraction of 20 boys and 36 girls aged 7 to 16 years (11.9Â±1.17 years on average).
The shape of the eyeball was judged of by the ratio of its anterior-posterior axial length (AL) to horizontal diameter (HD).
RESULTS
The incidence and value of peripheral myopic defocus in children appeared to decrease with clinical refraction increasing from high hyperopia to high myopia.  This was the first time, mixed peripheral refraction was found in children, occurring more frequently in higher myopia.
This mixed peripheral defocus, shown to be a transitional stage between relative peripheral myopia and relative hyperopia, indicates non-uniform stretching of posterior pole tissues in the course of refraction development and myopia progression.
As ocular refraction increases from high hyperopia to high myopia, the growth of AL outpaces that of HD.
CONCLUSION
Obviously, natural peripheral defocus results from changes in size and shape of the eyeball in the course of refraction development.
