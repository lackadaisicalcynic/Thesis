[An experience of using divasa in the treatment of cerebrovascular insufficiency].
AIM
To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of divasa in the treatment of patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The main group included 40 patients (mean age 56.2Â±5.7 years) with asthenic/autonomic and vestibular/ataxic disorders developed during chronic cerebrovascular disease.
The severity of symptoms was measured with the Visual Analogue scale (VAS).
Neuropsychological and psychoemotional status was assessed with MMSE, MFI-20, HAM-A, a subjective sleep questionnaire, a scheme for detection of signs of autonomic disorders.  Quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) and CGI scale were used as well.
The plasma levels of fibrinogen and the von Willebrand factor were determined in all patients.
The control group included 40 patients with chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency matched for age, sex and severity of neurological symptoms to the main group.  RESULTS
The scores of asthenic symptoms, anxiety, sleep disorders and autonomic disorders were decreased significantly that led to the improvement of quality of life of patients.  A significant decrease and normalization of the plasma levels of fibrinogen and the von Willebrand factor were identified in the patients of the main group.
The drug was well-tolerated, side-effects (allergic reactions) were noted only in 5%.  CONCLUSION
The positive effect of divasa on patient's condition was demonstrated.  The drug may be recommended for the use in complex treatment of these patients.
