[Aging of the myocardium and dilated cardiomyopathy: morphological and molecular aspects].  The review considers various aspects of myocardium aging in normal and dilated cardiomyopathy (DC).
There is a partial fibrosis of the heart tissue due to accumulation of collagen type 1, and accumulation of amyloid during normal aging.
Men myocardial aging is accompanied by loss of cardiomyocytes and increased volume of the remaining cells, whereas in women this effect is absent.
There is an expression of nuclear proteins decrease (lamin A and C), the accumulation of lipofuscin, increased content of reactive oxygen species, reduction of protein synthesis Sirt1 in cardiomyocytes with aging.
Sirt1 has a cardioprotective effect, supports the balance of lipid metabolism, inhibits the development of inflammation and the formation of atherosclerotic plaques.
Reduction of its expression not only indicates the accelerated pace of myocardial aging, but can be a predictor of the development of DC.
In DC occurs stretching of the heart cavities and systolic dysfunction, predominantly in the left ventricle.
DC is characterized by the development of inflammation in the myocardium.  Its markers is increased expression of ICAM-1 adhesion molecule, MMP-2, MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinases, TIMP-1 tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases and decreased expression of MMP-1 matrix metalloproteinase.
