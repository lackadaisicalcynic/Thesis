[Asthma and metabolic syndrome: Clinical and pathogenetic relationships].  Asthma and metabolic syndrome (MS) are common and social diseases.
External and internal factors influencing the development and manifestations of asthma are identified; among which there is obesity that is a major risk factor for MS.  Accordingly, the concurrence of asthma and MS and to study their clinical and pathogenetic relationships are a topical problem.
There is a tendency to identify a particular asthma phenotype that is characterized by later-onset disease in the presence of obesity; the low prevalence of atopy, low serum level of IgE, and a poorly-controlled course with a trend of standard therapy resistance.
It is necessary to understand the essence of asthma cause-effect relationships in the presence of obesity for defining management tactics for this group of patients.
