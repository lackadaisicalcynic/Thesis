[How necessary to perform neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer in geriatric patients?]  A comparative analysis of the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in colorectal cancer patients older and younger than 60 years has been performed.
It was determined that the risk of complications of neoadjuvant CRT, as well as the degree of its adverse effect on outcomes after surgical treatment, are not significant for the age of patients.  However, the use of preoperative CRT in elderly patients is associated with a less significant increase in recurrence-free survival in comparison with younger patients.
Thus, the age factor should not limit the use of neoadjuvant CRT in patients with satisfactory general status and the absence of severe complications of the pathological process.
