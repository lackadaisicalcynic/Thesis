[No-touch pancreatectomy and radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy: a systematic review].
AIM  To summarize the data of 'no-touch isolation technique' (NIT) for pancreatoduodenectomy and radical antegrade modular pancreato-splenectomy (RAMPS) for pancreatic malignancies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We looked through Pubmed and Cochrane databases for scientific papers published from January 2000 until September 2014.
RESULTS
Eight studies were included.  There were 7 retrospective cohort studies and one randomized controlled trial (RCT).
Mean operation time and blood loss were 267 min (198-386 min) and 132 ml (331-744 ml) respectively.
Mean morbidity rate was 35% (17-58%).
There was no 30-day mortality.
Mean incidence of R0-resection varied from 50% to 97% with average value 84%.
Median survival was reported in 3 studies (17, 18 and 26 months).
Five-year actuarial overall survival was reported in 4 studies (31, 36, 40 and 53%).
CONCLUSION
Positive results of NIT and RAMPS might justify further evaluation of the method in pancreatic cancer.
Prospective randomized controlled trials needs to be done to demonstrate the oncological value of this novel surgical technique.
