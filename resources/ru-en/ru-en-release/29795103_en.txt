[Rationale for caries prevention in young adults based on caries resistance rates].
The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of caries prevention in young adults with different caries resistance rates.
Sixty-seven patients aged 18-20 with low (n=32) and high (n=35) dmft were enrolled in the study.  Caries prevention efficacy was assessed by laboratory tests: enamel resistance test (ERT), clinical enamel remineralization speed test (CERST), estimation of calcium and inorganic phosphorus in oral fluid.
Patients with high caries activity in addition to conventional prevention program received prophylaxis procedure with Clinpro White Varnish (3M ESPE).  ERT and CERST were significantly higher in high dmft (>13) subgroup.
Statistically significant difference in ERT and CERST was observed between subgroups at 3 and 6 months evaluation after prevention program.
