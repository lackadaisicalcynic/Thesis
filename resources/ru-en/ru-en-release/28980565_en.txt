AIM  To develop a new combination treatment for cataract and glaucoma that would involve drainage of the suprachoroidal space with an autoscleral flap and to assess the outcomes of patients who underwent combined phacoemulsification and non-penetrating deep sclerectomy with suprachoroidal drainage with an autoscleral flap.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We have studied the results of combination surgical treatment of cataract and glaucoma performed in 34 patients (34 eyes), notably phacoemulsification and non-penetrating deep sclerectomy with suprachoroidal drainage.
RESULTS
In the early postoperative period, visual acuity ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 and was consistent with retinal changes.  Particularly, in 7 cases (21%) visual acuity was 0.5, in 16 cases (47%) - 0.6, and in 11 cases (32%) - 0.7.
The intraocular pressure (IOP) decreased to an average of 17.2±2.4 mmHg.  At 6 months, the IOP remained within statistically normal limits (16.0±1.8 mmHg) in all cases.
Visual acuity ranged from 0.5 to 0.7.
In the late postoperative period (after 1 year), 32 patients were normotonic (their IOP averaged 16.0±2.3 mmHg) and 2 patients developed elevated IOP and, thus, were prescribed antihypertensive therapy (β-blockers).
CONCLUSION
Non-penetrating deep sclerectomy with suprachoroidal drainage ensures the IOP reduction's stability and does not require the use of donor material.
