[Laparoscopic decompression of celiac trunk in children].
MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period 2013-2016 four patients were treated at the Filatov Children's City Clinical Hospital #13.
There were 2 children aged 14 years and 2 children aged 17 years.
All patients have been diagnosed via anamnesis, complaints, pulse-wave doppler sonography, contrast-enhanced MDCT and angiography.  After comprehensive examination 3 patients underwent laparoscopic decompression of celiac trunk.
In all cases celiac trunk compression was predominantly caused by median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm combined with neurofibrotic tissue of celiac plexus.
RESULTS  All patients were discharged after laparoscopic decompression of celiac trunk.
Intra- and postoperative complications, as well as cases of conversion were absent.
Mean time of surgery was 65 minutes.  In all cases postoperative period was smooth (4 days on the average).
Two patients underwent follow-up examination in long-term postoperative period: pulse-wave doppler sonography, contrast-enhanced MDCT and angiography.
In both cases reduced severity, incidence and duration of pain syndrome were observed.
CONCLUSION
Clinical examples show some problems in diagnosis and treatment of compressive stenosis of celiac trunk due to rarity of pathology especially in childhood.
Nevertheless, combination of abdominal ischemia and celiac trunk stenosis confirmed by instrumental diagnosis is indication for surgical treatment.
