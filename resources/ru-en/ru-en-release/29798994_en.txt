[The role of CO2-laser in scarring management].
AIM
To assess the role of CO2-laser in treatment of various scars and to determine the indications for its application.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
It has been carried out a prospective analysis of treatment of 218 patients with scars of different duration, locations and anatomic areas with the use of CO2-laser for the period 2011-2017.
POSAS scale and sonography were used for analysis.
RESULTS
1. Laser therapy is not effective for scarring-related functional defects (contractures, ectropion, microstomia), when surgery is indicated.
2. The outcomes of treatment (both surgical and laser) depend on the time of existence of the scars rather their cause and anatomical region.
3. Laser therapy is not effective enough for formed scars existing over 12 months.  4. Laser therapy is effective for immature scars, especially indicated for cicatricial deformation when the aesthetics cannot be repaired with traditional surgery.
CONCLUSION
Application of CO2-laser in scars treatment with regard to its real efficiency determines the effectiveness of therapy.
