[Optimization of the method for the postoperative treatment following rhinoplasty].  This article was designed to report the results of analysis of the dynamics of oedema of the soft tissues of the external nose and the adjacent facial structures in different periods following rhinoplasty.
The metric characteristics were calculated and the integral index of tissue oedema was determined for 374 patients allocated to two groups.  The main group was comprised of 286 (86.5%) patients who underwent the postoperative rehabilitative treatment making use of the proposed method.
The remaining 88 (23.5%) patients constituted the group of comparison.  The analysis of the data obtained has demonstrated that the compliance with the newly developed algorithm for the postoperative rehabilitation permits to considerably reduce the severity of the inflammatory reaction of the organism to the post-surgical trauma and to shorten the duration of the postoperative rehabilitation.
