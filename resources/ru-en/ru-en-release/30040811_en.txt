[Olfactory neuroepithelium as a model for the studies of molecular mechanisms of schizophrenia].  Olfactory neuroepithelium (OE) is shown to be a suitable experimental model to study neuronal biomarkers of psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia.
Olfactory neuronal precursors can be useful for studying neurodevelopmental stages, neuronal markers, pharmacological screening.
However, a limited number of research groups have used this cell model in a small number of patients and healthy people that can be explained by several factors.
Based on literature reports and own research, the authors analyze the advantages and limitations of OE-derived cell/tissue models.  The main limitations of these models are decreased rate of harvesting and culturing OE-derived cell and low percentage of patients who agreed to participate in the study.
Our results showed that only 10% of patients with schizophrenia signed informed consent for nasal biopsy, 80% of them underwent biopsy.
