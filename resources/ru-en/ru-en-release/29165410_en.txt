AIM  to develop a surgical approach to the treatment of purulent corneal ulcer in eyes with neurotrophic keratitis with lagophthalmos after auditory neuroma removal or stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 12 patients (13 eyes) have been managed.
All received combined surgery that included simultaneous keratoplasty, autoconjunctivoplasty, and permanent partial tarsorrhaphy.
RESULTS
Ocular integrity was preserved in all cases, and also vision - in half of them.  In 29% of cases, visual acuity increased from 0.09±0.05 up tо 0.21±0.13. Lagophthalmos decreased from 5.86±1.35 mm down to 3.01±0.75 mm.
CONCLUSION
Patients with intracranial lesions complicated by neurotrophic keratitis and lagophthalmos often develop progressive purulent ulcers of the cornea.
One-step keratoplasty, autoconjunctivoplasty, and permanent partial tarsorrhaphy is an effective treatment that can help preserve visual function in such eyes.
