[Thyroid status peculiarities of elderly patients 5 years after operation depending on the volume of surgical intervention].  Long-term results of treatment of 180 patients operated 5 years ago for benign thyroid nodular pathology have been analyzed in the present paper, the results being analyzed depending on the volume of surgical intervention.
The rate of postoperative hypothyrodism is lower in patients who had undergone limited thyroid resection, recurrent cases are more frequent, but they are not clinically significant and seldom require reoperation.  It should also be noted that those patients have fewer cardiac complaints as the dose of hormone replacement therapy preparations is small.
Elder patients who had undergone functionally significant thyroidectomy and need to take great doses of Thyroxin (107-150 mcg/day) have cardiac complaints more often
(43 %) comparing to those who had undergone limited resections
(35 %).
