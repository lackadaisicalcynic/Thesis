[Comparison of interdental oral hygiene aids efficiency in patients with healthy periodontium: a split-mouth study].  AIM
Comparison of different interdental aids efficiency in patients with healthy periodontium.  METHODS
A non-randomized controlled split-mouth study was carried out in 25 young adults with healthy periodontium.  The mouth was divided into 4 quadrants.
All the participants used manual toothbrush.  Additional hygienic aids included SPS prime (Curaprox) interdental in quadrant 1 brushes, dental floss (Curaprox) in quadrant 2, unituft toothbrush (Curaprox) in quadrant 3, no interdental aids were used in quadrant 4.
The oral hygiene efficiency was assessed after 4 weeks with Silness-Loe Plaque Index (PI) and Rustogi et al.
Modified Navy Plaque Index (RMNPI).  RESULTS
After 4 weeks the mean value of PI decreased from 1.2±0.27 to 0.7±0.28, the mean value of RMNPI decreased from 0.7±0.11 to 0.5±0.16. At the primary examination, there was no statistically significant difference of PI and RMNPI values between the quadrants.  After 4 weeks, ANOVA test demonstrated significant difference between the quadrants.
The minimal PI and RMNPI values were determined in quadrant 1 (0.4±0.16 and 0.3±0.11, respectively).  The maximal PI and RMNPI values were determined in quadrant 4 (1.0±0.21 and 0.6±0.14, respectively).
There was no significant difference between quadrants 2 and 3.
CONCLUSION
In limitations of this study, the maximal oral hygiene efficiency was achieved with use of manual toothbrush combined with interdental brush.
