[Integrated approach to nasal defects reconstruction].  The aim of the study was to define and solve main problems in nasal defects reconstruction procedures planning.
Fifty-two patients with nasal defects treated in Central Research Institute of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery in 2010-2015 were included in the study.
In 28 cases the defects were reconstructed by means of paramedial forehead flap.  The authors highlight typical procedure pitfalls mainly associated with the planning stage.
The study results prove paramedical forehead flap to be the most useful tool for subtotal and total nasal defects reconstruction but meticulous procedure planning is a must for success.
