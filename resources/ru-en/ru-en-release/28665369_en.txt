[Changes in cerebral perfusion in patients undergoing revascularization of carotid artery stenosis].  Ischemic stroke is caused by atherosclerotic lesions in extra- and intracranial arteries in about 25% of cases.
Revascularization surgery has been long and widely used for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid arteries.
However, currently the changes in cerebral perfusion in patients with atherosclerotic lesions of brachiocephalic arteries, who underwent surgical revascularization, are still not fully understood.
This article highlights the issues of changes of cerebral hemodynamics in patients undergoing surgery on the carotid arteries.
