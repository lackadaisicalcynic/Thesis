[An acute acoustic injury during the early postoperative period following stapedoplasty].  This article was designed to report a clinical case of an acute acoustic injury inflicted by a discharge of the lightning ball during the early postoperative period in a female patient following surgical stapedoplasty.
The acoustic impact resulted in a marked deterioration of hearing in the operated ear with simultaneous elevation of the threshold of bone sound conduction to above the preoperative value.
It is concluded that the patients who had undergone the stapedoplastic surgical intervention should be advised to avoid strong acoustic impacts during the postoperative period.
