[Modern strategies of protection of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage].
Nowadays, there are two complementary approaches to treatment of patients with ischemic stroke: reperfusion and neuroprotection.  The main purpose of neuroprotection is to intervene ischemic cascade at every stage of the pathological process and thus avoid the death of nerve cells and expand the therapeutic window for reperfusion therapy.
The use of drugs with neurotrophic, antioxidant and neuroregenerative effects is pathogenically explained at all stages of post stroke rehabilitation.
Ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate (mexidol) is a derivative of succinic acid with antihypoxic, membrane protective, nootropic, anticonvulsant and sedative action.
The majority of researchers confirmed the positive effect of mexidol expressed as the marked regression of neurological deficit and wider opportunities for further early rehabilitation.  The results of the randomized double blind multicenter placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial of the efficacy and safety of prolonged sequential therapy with mexidol in the acute and early recovery stages of hemispheric ischemic stroke (EPICA) were published in 2017.
The results of the study showed the best positive dynamics of neurological function recovery in case of timely treatment with mexidol with the following two month therapy.
The safety of the long-term use of mexidol was confirmed.
