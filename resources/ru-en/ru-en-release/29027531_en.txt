[Costal cartilage structural and functional changes in children with a funnel or keeled chest].  Congenital chest wall deformities (CCWDs) in children are severe diseases leading to cosmetic defects and diseases of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems.
The most common of these deformities are funnel-shaped (pectus excavatum, FD) and keeled (pectus carinatum, KD) ones.
The pathogenesis of CCWDs and the role of costal cartilage structural and functional changes in their pathogenesis have now been not well studied, which makes it difficult to elaborate pathogenetic approaches to correcting these diseases.
Analysis of the literature has shown that structural and functional changes occur in the matrix and chondrocytes from the costal cartilage in FD.
Similar costal cartilage changes are observed in KD.
It is still unknown exactly which pathological processes are present in the costal cartilage and how they result in the development of one or other type of CCWDs.
The role of amianthoid transformation (AT) of costal cartilages in these processes is also unknown.
It is not improbable that it is AT drastically changing the native cartilage matrix, which is one of the key mechanisms leading to changes in its properties and to the subsequent development of FD or KD.
