[Forensic medical diagnostics of the impact of the ligatures made from different materials in the cases of strangulation asphyxia].
The identification of the instruments of injury resulting from neck compression not infrequently encounters difficulties.
We developed an experimental model allowing to evaluate the impact of ligatures made from different materials on non-biological objects.
The use of spectral techniques including X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and emission spectral analysis made it possible to detect and identify the chemical elements transferred from the loop material onto the object's surface.
Specifically, the transfer of the elements contained in the rubber of the electric cable braid was demonstrated.  The presence of these elements together with microparticles of rubber at the surface of the study objects proved to be a diagnostic sign giving evidence of the impact of the rubber sheath of the electric cable leaving the strangulation mark on the object's surface..
The results of the present experiments confirm the possibility of using spectral methods along with other techniques for the identification of a ligature employed as the instrument of strangulation injury.
