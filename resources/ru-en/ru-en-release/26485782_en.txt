Benign Fibro-Osseous Lesions of the Craniofacial Area in Children and Adolescents: A Review.
Benign fibro-osseous lesions (BFOL) of the craniofacial area are represented by a variety of morphologic processes that are characterized by pathologic ossifications and calcifications in association with a hypercellular fibroblastic marrow element.
