[Long-term results of surgical treatment of patients with aortic valve disease and functional mitral insufficiency].
AIM
To analyze long-term surgical results in patients with aortic valve disease and concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR) depending on volume of valve surgery.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was studied 5-year results in 71 patients with aortic valve disease and different degree of mitral regurgitation.  Patients were divided into 3 groups.
Control group included 40 patients after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and no mitral insufficiency.  The 2nd group consisted of 16 patients after AVR and concomitant mitral regurgitation degree 2-3.
The 3rd group - 15 patients after aortic and mitral valve replacement.
Mortality in long-term postoperative period, quality of life, incidence of complications and echocardiography data were analyzed.  RESULTS
There was no significant improvement of mitral regurgitation after AVR.  It was showed that persistent MR decreases remote survival and quality of life as well as deteriorates echocardiography data.
Herewith these data in the 3rd group did not differ from the control group.
CONCLUSION
Double-valve replacement may be advisable in patients with aortic valve disease and concomitant moderate MR because persistent MR deteriorates long-term
RESULTS  However prolonged time of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamping, greater blood loss require comprehensive approach to advanced cardiac surgery.
