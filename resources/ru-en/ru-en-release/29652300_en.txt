[Predictors of remote outcomes of brain injury].
AIM  To determine predictors of remote outcomes of complex combat brain injury.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A survey of 145 combatants with long-term combat injury (from 1 to 10 years) was conducted.
Responses were received from 30 people from 18 regions of the Russian Federation.
Data analysis included nonparametric correlation analysis using Spearman coefficient.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Significant correlations were between the remote functional outcome and the following predictors: the severity of injury at admission (r=0.527; p<0,01), leukocyte level at admission (r=0.594; p<0,01), presence and severity of pelvic disturbances (r=0.574; p<0,01), the duration of staying in intensive care (r=0.476; p<0,01), neurological deficit severity and scores on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (r=0.469; p<0,01).
Character of remote outcome was associated with posttraumatic amnesia (r=0.491; p<0,05), concomitant injuries of abdominal cavity organs, kidney, bladder, time of starting peroral feeding (r=0.377; p<0,05), mean heart rhythm rate during the first 14 days of treatment, pneumonia (r=0.377; p<0,05) and episodes of psychomotor agitation (r=0.381; p<0,05) within a period of hospital treatment.
These results need confirmation in a larger study.
