[Oxidative stress in women with insomnia in different stages of menopause].
AIM  To investigate of a lipid peroxidation (LPO) process and the antioxidant defense system (ADS) in peri- and postmenopausal women with insomnia.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
47 perimenopausal women and 71 postmenopausal ones were examined.
Each group was divided into 2 subgroups: 1) individuals with insomnia and 2) controls.
LPO-ADS spectrophotometric studies were used in the investigation.
RESULTS
There was an increase in the serum levels of ketodienes and conjugated trienes and a decrease in those of Î±-tocopherol and retinol in postmenopause versus in perimenopause.
In insomnia, there was a rise in the level of ketodienes and conjugated trienes in perimenopause; LPO substrates with conjugated double bonds, diene conjugates, and thiobarbituric acid-active products in postmenopause.
The indicators of ADS do not differ from those in the controls.
The integral indicator of oxidative stress assessment suggests that there is a LPO-ADS imbalance in the menopausal women with insomnia, which is most pronounced in postmenopause.
CONCLUSION
The findings suggest that the patients with insomnia develop oxidative stress that is more marked in postmenopause.
