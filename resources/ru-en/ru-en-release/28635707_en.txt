[The medical rehabilitation of the children presenting with atopic dermatitis (a literature review)].  Atopic dermatitis takes the predominant position in the structure of skin pathologies in the children of various age.
Both the scientifically based forecasts and the data of numerous investigations give evidence not only of the significant increase in the number of patients presenting with this condition but also of the growing severity of this disease.  Taken together, these facts account for the serious medico-social importance of the problems arising in connection with this pathology.
The introduction of the eliminative actions, a hypoallergenic diet, local and systemic pharmacotherapeutic modalities do not always allow to prevent or arrest the inflammatory process and achieve the long-standing remission.
The high frequency of undesirable reactions to the pharmacological products turns the attention of many clinicians to the application of the non-pharmacological factors and methods for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in the children.
The main objectives of physical therapy in the case of atopic dermatitis include the normalization of the state of the central and vegetative nervous system, the achievement of hyposensitization, sedative, anti-toxic, and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as the application of the dissolving, trophic, and antipruritogenic agents, strengthening of the general health status of the children.
