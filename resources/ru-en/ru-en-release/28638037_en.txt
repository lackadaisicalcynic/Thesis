[Melatonin in therapy of sleep disorders age-related estrogen deficiency].
AIM  To assess quantitative characteristics of sleep in perimenopausal women treated with melatonin in a dose of 3 mg during 3 month.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A study included 21 perimenopausal women with sleep disorders.
Seventeen women completed the study.
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), anamnestic and gynecological examinations, polysomnographic monitoring (PSM) were used.  All patients received melatonin (melaxen) 30 min before going to bed in a dose of 3 mg daily during 3 month.
Insomnia was confirmed by PSM.  The dynamics of PSM demonstrated the improvement of the latency to sleep onset, total sleep efficiency and increase in percentage of REM-sleep.
A significant number of EEG activation responses showed a decrease in sleep fragmentation and improvement of the structure of sleep segments.
CONCLUSION
The use of melatonin drugs, including melaxen in a dose of 3 mg during 3 month, is one of the main methods of treatment of sleep disorders in age-related estrogen deficiency.
The main clinical effect was due to the elimination of pre- and intrasomnic disorders.
