[A new concept of organization and scope of neurosurgical care in the US army during armed conflicts in the early 2000s].
Military operations in various parts of the world in the early 2000s are becoming more regionalized; new warfare tactics emerge, which makes it necessary to review and modify the neurosurgical care system.  The article reviews the results of original studies on this issue and summarizes the experience of the US Army medical service in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The article discusses the structure of sanitary losses, organization and scope of medical and evacuation neurosurgical measures, types and techniques of surgical interventions, and the rate of complications.  We describe five levels of neurosurgical care echelons and an implemented "injury control - neurosurgery" concept; particular attention is paid to the peculiarities of research and specialist training.
We demonstrate that implementation of the new concept for organization and scope of neurosurgical care has improved treatment outcomes and reduced the mortality rate in the mentioned military conflicts of recent years compared to those in the Vietnam War.
We may conclude that the described experience of the US Army can be used to improve the efficacy of neurosurgical care to the wounded and victims of armed conflicts.
