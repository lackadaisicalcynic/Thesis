[An essential negative effect of a family history of substance use on readiness for drug dependence rehabilitation treatment in inpatients with addictions].  AIM
To reveal objective factors predicting the readiness of inpatient drug treatment patients to undergo a rehabilitation program.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  In a retrospective comparative study, drug-dependent individuals (n=199, 16.6% females, 83.4% men, 91.5% opioid-dependent) were studied.
After conducting motivational activities based on cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, the premorbid, anamnestic, clinical, socio-demographic characteristics of patients were studied as possible predictors of readiness for rehabilitation using binary logistic regression.  RESULTS
Family history of substance use reduced the probability of readiness for rehabilitation by >4,5 times (p<0.0001, Exp (B) = 4.577, CI 95% [2.0556, 10.190]).  The influence of other factors was weaker and manifested itself only with their combinations (female sex + use of several psychoactive drugs; intravenous drug injection + polydrug addiction; non-remission course of disease + family history of substance use) which increased the likelihood of readiness for rehabilitation.
There was no effect of social/demographic variables.
CONCLUSION
Family history of substance use significantly reduces the likelihood of readiness for rehabilitation.  The clinical severity of the disease, on the other hand, increases the chances of readiness.
Patients with a family history of substance use represent a specific group of patients requiring maximum efforts in the process of motivation for rehabilitation.
