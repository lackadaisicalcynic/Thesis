[MRI diagnostics of bone marrow oedema and its significance for the forensic medical evaluation of the injuries to bones and articulations].  The objective of the present study was the analysis of the publications in the literature dealing with radiological methods employed for the diagnostics of injuries to and diseases of the bones and articulations as well as the role of bone marrow oedema in the development of these conditions in the specific context of the problems facing forensic medical expertise.
The main results of the domestic and foreign authors concerning MRI-based investigations into the nature of injuries and other pathological changes in bones and articulations during different periods after their development are discussed with the major emphasis placed on diagnostics of bone marrow oedema.
Magnetic resonance visualization of this diagnostic feature and the related manifestations of the above conditions in many cases provides an indisputable evidence of the damage whereas the discovery of its distribution to and localization in the bone structures makes it possible to elucidate the sources of this condition, such as a blow, torsional stress, stretching, etc., and its underlying mechanisms.
The character and the mode of distribution of the signal from a bone marrow oedema under various conditions of visualization allow to carry out differential diagnostics of the damage prescription period of up to 1.5 months.
