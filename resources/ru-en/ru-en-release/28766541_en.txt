[Use of crizotinib for refractory ALK-positive lymphomas].
AIM  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of crizotinib used in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The paper describes the experience with crizotinib used in 8 patients with refractory ALK-ALCL before and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
RESULTS
All the 8 (100%) patients treated with crizotinib were recorded to have complete responses, including complete metabolic ones
(tumor disappearance as evidenced by positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography.
CONCLUSION
Low and manageable toxicity of crizotinib and complete PET-negative responses in patients with resistant ALK lymphomas favor the need to test the drug as first-line therapy, by possibly decreasing the intensification of chemotherapy.
