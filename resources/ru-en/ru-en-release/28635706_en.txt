[The physical methods for the prevention and management of weather-dependent pathological reactions (a literature review)].  The review presents data on the non-pharmacological methods and technologies for the prevention and management of meteopathic reactions (MPR) applied in Russia for the treatment of the patients suffering from obstructive and cardiovascular diseases.
It is assumed, based on the concept of heliogeophysical imprinting, that the major factors responsible for the development of MPR are the disturbances of electromagnetic homeostasis.
The acupuncture points and channels are regarded as a system designed for the maintenance of electromagnetic balance in the human body.  In this context, it is proposed to encourage the application of the methods of electro-diagnostics and reflexology for the prevention and correction of meteopathic reactions.
