[Clinical and morphological correlations in occult hepatitis B].  Occult hepatitis B (ОHB) characterized by the absence of blood HBsAg attracts the attention of specialists of different profiles; however, its clinical morphological aspects have not been practically studied.
AIM  to estimate the proportion of OHB in the structure of fatal outcomes in chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) and to characterize its clinical course and structural changes on autopsy materials.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 455 autopsy cases of CVH were examined for its etiology in the S.P. Botkin Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases in 2014-2016.
An in-depth prospective clinical analysis was made to investigate 28 cases of OHB in the stage of decompensated liver cirrhosis, which had subsequently culminated in death.  The criteria of inclusion were history data and clinical symptoms of CVH in the detection of markers for hepatitis A, C, and D and HIV in serum HBcAb in the absence of HBsAg.
HBsAbs were also determined.  Along with the traditional morphological examination, immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HBsAg and HBcAg was carried out.
RESULTS
There were 108 CVHB cases (23.7% of the total cases of CVH), including 77 OHB cases (71.3% of those of CVHB) while HBsAg was not determined.  HBsAb-negative patients were more often observed to have clinical signs of jaundice (p<0.05) and skin itching (p<0.05).
Dyspepsia and hemorrhagic manifestations prevailed in patients with HBsAb (more than 10 IU/l) (p<0.05). All the cases were found to have characteristic morphological signs of CVH, including intranuclear inclusions and nuclear polymorphism in 10.7% of deaths.  There was an IHC-positive reaction to VHB antigens in 28.6% of the patients and a doubtful reaction in 25.0%.
Serum НВсAb may serve as a diagnostic marker for HBV infection.  Clinical and morphological correlations enabled the authors to state that CVHB was present in all cases in the absence of serum HBsAg in the patients.
