[Electrophysiological characteristics of the retina in children with cicatrical retinopathy of prematurity].  Visual impairment in children with regressive retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) are diverse and widespread.
PURPOSE  to describe the electrophysiological characteristics of the retina in children with I-V stages of regressive ROP.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included children with stages I-V aged 5 to 17 (in the disease stages of IV and V - with reattachment of the retina after surgical treatment of its detachment).
Patients with concomitant diseases of the eye were excluded from the study.
The main group included 133 children (163 eyes) aged 5 to 17 (mean age 7.2±0.3).
Gestation age was 30.0±0.2 weeks, birth weight - 1368.0±46.6g.
The control group consisted of 55 age-matched children.
Standard electroretinogram (ERG) was performed in all study subjects.
The amplitude-time characteristics of maximum and photopic response a- and b-waves were evaluated, and the b/a-index was calculated.
RESULTS
Visual acuity of 0.6 or higher was observed in 18 eyes (54.5%) of children with stage I-II ROP and significantly less in the disease stages of III and IVa - 29.5% and 15.6% respectively (p<0.01: Φ=2,717-3,663).
In patients with IVb-V stages in 94.1% of cases visual acuity was lower than 0.1. Anamnesis showed significant decrease in photopic ERG starting with active period of stage III ROP.
The retinal function further progressively decreased with stages. b/a index of maximum ERG increased proportionally to the severity of ROP active period.
Core b/a index was significantly reduced in all stages of ROP (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION
Even the early stages of ROP have consequences for the functional status of the retina in premature infants; it is accompanied by significant disturbance of its electrogenesis.
