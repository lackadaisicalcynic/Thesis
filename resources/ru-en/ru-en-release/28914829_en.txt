[Circular tracheal resection for cicatrical stenosis and functioning tracheostomy].  AIM
To analyze the results of tracheal resection for cicatricial stenosis depending on the presence of tracheostomy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
1128 patients with tracheal cicatricial stenosis were treated for the period 1963-2015.  The first group consisted of 297 patients for the period 1963-2000, the second group - 831 patients for the period 2001-2015.
Most of them 684 (60.6%) were young and able-bodied (age from 21 to 50 years).
In the first group 139 (46.8%) out of 297 patients had functioning tracheostomy.
For the period 2001-2015 tracheostomy was made in 430 (51.7%) out of 831 patients with cicatricial stenosis.
Time of cannulation varied from a few weeks to 21 years.
RESULTS
Re-tracheostomy within various terms after decanulation was performed in 68 (15.8%) patients.
Tracheal resection with anastomosis was performed in 59 and 330 in both groups respectively.
At present time these operations are performed more often in view of their standard fashion in everyday practice.
In the second group tracheal resection followed by anastomosis was observed in 110 (25.6%) out of 430 patients with tracheostomy that is 4.4 times more often than in previous years.
In total 2 patients died after 330 circular tracheal resections within 2001-2015 including one patient with and one patient without tracheostomy.
Mortality was 0.6%.
Moreover, this value was slightly higher in patients operated with a functioning tracheostomy compared with those without it - 0.9 vs. 0.5% respectively.
The causes of death were bleeding into tracheobronchial lumen and pulmonary embolism.
The source of bleeding after tracheal resection was innominate artery.
Overall incidence of postoperative complications was 2 times higher in tracheostomy patients compared with those without it - 22 (20%) vs. 26 (11.8%) cases respectively.
Convalescence may be achieved in 89.8% patients after circular tracheal resection.
Adverse long-term results are associated with postoperative complications.  So their prevention and treatment will improve the outcomes.
