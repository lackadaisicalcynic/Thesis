[Neurological disorders in preterm children with neuropathy].
AIM  To establish the correlation between the frequency and severity of hypoxic CNS lesions in preterm children with neuropathy and improve the early diagnosis of lesions of the brain structures based on clinical ophthalmologic results.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The authors examined 712 premature infants with body mass <1500 g born before 30 weeks of gestation during 2006-2016.
Ophthalmological monitoring of retinopathy (RP), an analysis of medical history, neurological examination and neurosonography were performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
RP was found in 367 (51.5%) children.
In 255 children, the disease regressed naturally.
One hundred and twelve (15.7%) children, underwent laser coagulation of the avascular retina due to the severity of RP.
Signs of intraventricular hemorrhages (IVH) were noted in 434 (61%) children in the neonatal period.
IVH were found in 285 (77.6%) children with RP.
RP with the regression after laser coagulation was combined with IVH in 98% of cases, with the higher frequency (55.3%) of IVH, 3rd degree.
Periventricular leucomalation (PVL) was found in 10% of children without RP, in 22.3% of children with RP with naturally regression and in 51,7% of children with RP with laser coagulation of the retina.
In 70 children, neurosonographic signs of ischemia of the head of caudate nucleus were identified on the 14-15th days of life.
In this group, RP developed in 54 (77%) children, 27 (38.5%) children needed laser coagulation of the retina.
The correlation found between the severity of RP and hypoxic CNS lesions in highly preterm infants might allow the prognosis of visual and neurosomatic disturbances in the early age and timely effective rehabilitation.
