[Assessment of severity of lesions of arterial basins in patients with multifocal atherosclerosis].  The present study was aimed at working out a methodology combining clinical, haemodynamic, and functional parameters of lesions of arterial basins in patients presenting with concomitant lesions of the aortic arch branches and arteries of lower extremities.
The authors retrospectively investigated the results of examining a total of 181 patients operated on for concomitant atherosclerotic lesions of the aortic arch branches, terminal portion of the abdominal aorta, and lower limb arteries.
In patients subjected as the first stage to interventions on the aortic arch branches (Group 1), the index of severity of the lesion of the aortic arch branches (Cs) was higher than in those from Groups 2 and 3.
In Group 2 patients who as the first stage underwent reconstruction of the terminal portion of the abdominal aorta and lower-limb arteries, the index of severity of lesions of lower limb arteries (Ls) turned out to be higher as compared with patients from Groups 1 and 3.
The mean value of the Ls/Cs ratio for Group 1 patients amounted to 1.07, for Group 2 patients to 2.7, and for Group 3 subjects to 1.96.
The proposed methodology makes it possible to determine the degree of the lesion of arterial basins in patients suffering from multifocal atherosclerosis and may objectively reflect severity of the lesion thereof.
The comparative retrospective analysis has demonstrated that with the Ls/Cs ratio equaling 1.0, the first stage consisted in carrying out an intervention on the aortic arch branches, in the Ls/Cs ratio varying from 2.5 to 3.0, the first stage performed was reconstruction of the terminal portion of the abdominal aorta and arteries of the lower limbs, and cases associated with the Ls/Cs ratio equaling 2 involved simultaneous interventions.
A possibility of wide application of the method warrants further investigation.
