[Thoracoscopic subtotal esophageal resection for benign esophageal diseases].
AIM
To investigate the role of video-assisted subtotal esophageal resection in treatment of patients with benign esophageal diseases.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-one patients with benign esophageal diseases have undergone subtotal esophageal resection in our department for the period 2010-2017.  Thoracoscopic technique was applied in 25 cases, open approach - in 26 patients.
Total surgery time, thoracoscopic stage duration, length of hospital-stay (LOS), ICU-stay, Clavien-Dindo morbidity rates with separate registration of respiratory complications, mortality have been considered.
RESULTS
Groups were similar in terms of age, gender, ASA status.
Thoracoscopic stage duration gradually decreased from 175 to 65 min with average time of 102 (75; 123) min. Total surgery time was 390 (270; 495) min in group 1 and 465 (341; 561) min in the control group (р=0.035).
Mean ICU-stay decreased up to 2 (1.25; 3.75) days compared with the control group (5 (3.92; 5.85) days, р<0.0001).
Conversion rate was 8%.
In the main group complications Clavien-Dindo grade 2 were detected in 10 (40%) patients compared with 20 (69%) cases in the control group (р=0.009).
Respiratory complications occurred in 5 patients in group 1 and in 13 cases of the control group (р=0.039).
Mortality was absent.
CONCLUSION
Thoracoscopic subtotal esophageal resection may be advisable alternative to open surgery for patients with benign esophageal diseases due to lower postoperative morbidity and earlier rehabilitation followed by improved outcomes.
