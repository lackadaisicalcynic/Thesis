[Salivation after stroke].  Salivation after stroke (sialorrhea, hypersalivation, ptyalism) can be caused by the overproduction or a lack of utilization of saliva.
Patients after stroke often have sialorrhea as a result of dysphagia.  Neurogenic dysphagia in acute period after stroke occurs in 25-65% of patients.
The mortality rate among people with post-stroke dysphagia and tube feeding ranges from 20 to 24%.
Patients who suffering from profuse salivation have difficulties with articulation and swallowing, bad breath, irritation and maceration of perioral area, contamination of clothing and bed linen.
Profuse salivation increases caregiver burden as well.
Psychologically, profuse salivation leads to lower self-esteem and social isolation.
Pulmonary aspiration is the most serious complication of sialorrhea.  Injections of botulinum toxins in the large salivary glands and the m. cricopharyngeus are the most effective method of treatment.
