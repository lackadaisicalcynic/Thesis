[Traumatic brain injury: neurologic and psychiatric aspects].
Traumatic brain injury is among the leading social-medical problems that causes preventable deaths, health deterioration and disability in young individuals.  It is manifested by neurologic and psychiatric disorders, firstly by neurocognitive impairment.
Therapeutic interventions in traumatic brain injury include correction of cerebral disorders in the acute phase of trauma, treatment of neurocognitive impairment and symptomatic treatment of mental disorders.  The efficacy of treatment of neurocognitive deficits associated with brain injury is still unsatisfactory, which determines the need to find new medicines and therapeutic approaches.
