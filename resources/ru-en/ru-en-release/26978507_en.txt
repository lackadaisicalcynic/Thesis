[Meige's syndrome or segmental craniocervical dystonia: terminology, history and contemporary view].  The term "Meige's syndrome" or "Breughel's syndrome" is used by specialists for the description of blepharospasm with the involuntary movements in the lower part of the face and/or masseter muscle.
These eponyms "Meige's syndrome" and "Breughel's syndrome" make some mess in the terminology.
The term "segmental craniocervical dystonia" joins different blepharospam-plus phenotypes and reflects contemporary perceptions about its genetic and pathophysiological community.
Botulinotherapy is in fact the only way of symptomathic treatment of craniocervical dystonias.
