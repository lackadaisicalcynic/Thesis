[The efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation in acute ischemic stroke].  OBJECTIVE
To study an effect of the course treatment with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on cognitive functions, movement deficit, daily activity and cerebral hemodynamics in the acute ischemic stroke.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ninety-two patients, including 32 patients treated with TMS (the main group), 30 patients who received placebo (comparison group 1) and 30 patients who received low intensity magnetic stimulation and basic complex therapy during 10 days once a day (the comparison group 2), were examined.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A significant improvement of cognitive processes, restoration of motor functions, increase in daily activities, normalization of the cerebral hemodynamics were observed.  Based on these
the inclusion of TMS in the complex rehabilitation system of post-stroke patients is recommended.
