[The relationship of vitamin D level with markers of cardiorenal syndrome in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.]  The aim of the study was to examine the relationship of vitamin D levels with markers of cardiorenal syndrome in patients with COPD depending on the severity of bronchial obstruction.198 patients with COPD were divided into 2 groups depending on the severity of bronchial obstruction.
A deficiency of vitamin D was significantly more prevalent in COPD patients with GFRcys <60 ml/min/1,73 m2 compared to patients with preserved renal function.
A medium positive correlation of vitamin D levels with the severity of bronchial obstruction (r=0,419, p=0,001), medium negative correlation of vitamin D levels with exacerbation frequency (r=0,421, p=0,01) and CRP (r=0,301, p=0,02) were observed.  Significant negative correlation of vitamin D levels with the magnitude of albuminuria (r=0,345, p=0,02) was also discovered.
Significant lower relative frequency of hyperphosphatemia in patients with COPD 3, 4 severity (63,16 vs 78,69%, χ2=6,627, p<0,05), there was a positive correlation between the phosphorus level of the blood serum level of 25(ОН)D (r=+0,475, p=0,025).The level of vitamin D in some clinical situations can be considered as a promising biomarker of current cardiorenal continuum in patients with COPD, and its correction, as a possible way of slowing the progression of cardiovascular complications in such patients.
