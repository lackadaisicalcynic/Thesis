[Indicators of comorbidity in chronic broncho-obstructive pathology].  We studied the problem of comorbidity in hospitalized patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchial asthma (control group).
When conducting correlation and regression analysis also showed the existence of a close direct relationship between the comorbidity index and age in patients with chronic broncho-obstructive pathology.
Summary comorbidity index, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease significantly more than in 2 times differ from those of the comparison group.
There was revealed the increase of the comorbidity index with an increase in the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as the weighting of the forecast mortality within 3 years in COPD compared with bronchial asthma.
