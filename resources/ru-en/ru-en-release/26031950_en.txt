[Prevention of reflux-esophagitis after gastrectomy].  It is presented the results of gastrectomy in 431 patients with varying reconstructive-reparative stage.
The main group consisted of 146 patients who underwent developed technique with food reservoir performing after gastrectomy.  Control group included 285 patients after conventional digestive tract reconstruction.
It was concluded that 30.4% of patients have entero-esophageal reflux, in 21.7% and 8.7% of patients endoscopic and morphological signs of reflux-esophagitis were observed respectively.  Suggested technique creates gas bubble providing obturator mechanism and decreasing the frequency of entero-esophageal reflux to 26.3% and reflux-esophagitis to 5.3%.
It proves advantage of suggested method of gastroplasty for prevention of reflux-esophagitis in comparison with traditional digestive tract reconstruction after gastrectomy.
