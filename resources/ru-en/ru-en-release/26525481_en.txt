[A case of the successful function-preserving treatment of hyoid bone chondrosarcoma].  The authors report a case of the successful function-preserving treatment of a rare neck tumour, chondrosarcoma originating from the hyoid bone.
The proposed combined treatment allowed to preserve the respiratory, voice-generating and protective functions of the larynx.
The dynamic follow up failed to reveal the development of relapse or metastases during 1 year after surgery.
