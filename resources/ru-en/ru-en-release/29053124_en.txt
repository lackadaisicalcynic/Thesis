[The efficacy of cerebrolysin in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders].
AIM  To evaluate clinical and neurophysiological changes in children with different variants of autism spectrum disorders during treatment with cerebrolysin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty-three children with autism spectrum disorders, aged 4-6 years, were included in the study.
To assess the degree of autism, the quantitative scale of assessing the severity of child autism CARS ('Childhood Autism Rating Scale') was used.
A comparative analysis of the clinical picture of disease and data of the electroencephalographic examination in endogenous and exogenous (organic) variant of autism was made.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
In children with exogenous (organic) autism, the lower scores of autistic symptom on the CARS and a greater degree of functional immaturity of the cerebral cortex, according to electroencephalographic results, were found compared to children with endogenous autism.
After treatment with cerebrolysin, 27 children (62.8%) showed signs of improvement.  An improvement was noted in 13 children in with endogenous autism (56.5%) and in 14 children with organic autism (70.0%).
CARS scores showed a more pronounced decrease in this indicator in a subgroup of children with organic autism.
