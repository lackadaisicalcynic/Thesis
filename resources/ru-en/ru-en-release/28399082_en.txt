[The choice of the finger dermatoglyphic patterns for the dermatoglyphic studies depending on the functional activity of the hands].
The objective of the present study was to choose the finger dermatoglyphic patterns most closely related to the functional right- and left-handedness.  The dependence of significance of the said patterns on the functional right- and left-handedness was estimated based on the results of the determination of the absolute number of various types and subtypes of finger dermatoglyphics on the right and left hands as well as their percentage ratio.
The results obtained in the study were used to develop the classification of the finger dermatoglyphic patterns based on the analysis of the complicated influence of the functional right- and left-handedness on the prevalence of one or another pattern on the right or left hand.  It was shown that the totality of the intricate finger dermatoglyphic patterns can not be used for the purpose of the dermatoglyphic studies due to their structural diversity.
