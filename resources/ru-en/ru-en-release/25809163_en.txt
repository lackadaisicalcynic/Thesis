[Effectiveness of one-stage microdiscectomy and radiofrequency denervation of intervertebral joints compared to microdiscectomy in patients with spinal disc herniation].
The article analyzes of the early and long-term outcomes in 113 patients who underwent surgical treatment for lumbosacral disc herniations.  The first group of patients (n=32) underwent microdiscectomy in a combination with radiofrequency destruction (RFD) of the facet nerves.
The control group patients (n=81) underwent microdiscectomy.  This study demonstrates the advantage of combining RFD with open surgery.
In this case, regression of both nerve root and back pain is achieved, which greatly accelerates rehabilitation of patients, restoration of their work ability, and therefore their return to normal life.
