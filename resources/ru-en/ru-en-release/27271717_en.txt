[Efficiency of local cement reinforcing antibacterial implants in surgical treatment of long bones chronic osteomyelitis].  AIM  To present the results of treatment of long bones chronic osteomyelitis using local cement reinforcing antibacterial implant.  MATERIAL AND METHODS  The implant is made intraoperatively using polymethylmethacrylate.  It was used in main group (n=30), while conventional treatment was applied in comparison group (n=30).  RESULTS
Better early and remote outcomes were shown in main group including more effective and earlier suppression of infectious process, more than 2-fold decrease of recurrent infection incidence, minimization of risk of pathological fracture due to internal reinforcement, early recovery of extremity's function, creation of favorable conditions for bone structures restoration, substitution of post-resection bone defect and following organotypic reorganization of bone tissue.
