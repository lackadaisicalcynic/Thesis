AIM  To study morphological features of extraocular muscles in patients with endocrine myopathy taking into account the duration of the disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 16 patients with thyroid eye disease were included in the study.  After a routine ophthalmic examination, they all underwent extraocular muscle surgery and orbital decompression.
The biopsy material obtained at surgery was studied histopathologically.  RESULTS
Particular morphological changes have been found in muscles of endocrine myopathy patients.  Their relationship to disease duration has been also established.
CONCLUSION
Considering endocrine-related morphological changes in extraocular muscles, the favorable period for surgical correction has been defined.
