[Bilateral stenoses of carotids.  The surgical treatment in acute period of ischemic stroke in patients of different age groups].
The study included 138 patients who had 193 reconstructive operations on carotid arteries (CA) in the acute period of ischemic stroke.  The 1st group included 22 patients with bilateral stenosis, age under 60 years; the 2nd group - 33 patients with a bilateral stenosis at the age more than 60 years; the 3rd group consisted of 83 patients with bilateral stenosis of the ipsilateral CA were operated in an acute period of ischemic stroke, but with contraindications and/or refused the surgery on the contralateral CA.
Brain computer tomography, ultrasound duplex scanning of the CA with the assessment degree of stenosis and structure of plaques, also MSCT-AG of the head and neck vessels were performed for all patients.
Cerebral oximeter was used for assessing adequate cerebral perfusion during cross-clamping of the CA.
Indications for the installation of a temporary intraluminal shunt during cross-clamping of the CA performed according to the method.
