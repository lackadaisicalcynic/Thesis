[The relationship between schizophrenia and epilepsy: the history and current state of the problem].
The review deals with the background and current state of the relationship between schizophrenia and epilepsy.  The author presents results of recent epidemiological, neuropsychological, neurophysiological and genetic studies, indicating that these diseases may be different clinical variants of a common etiologic process (neurodevelopmental brain abnormalities), while epilepsy with chronic psychotic symptoms can be considered as an experimental model of schizophrenia pathogenesis.
