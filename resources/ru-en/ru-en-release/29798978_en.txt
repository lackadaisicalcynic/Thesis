[The relationship of pathological ankle-brachial index and cognitive decline in patients after ischemic stroke].
AIM  To identify associations between cognitive impairment and values of ankle-brachial index (ABI) in patients after ischemic stroke at discharge from the hospital and over one-year follow-up.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 375 patients with normal (n=192) and elevated (n=153) ABI who underwent ischemic stroke (IS).
Neurological examination was performed using NIHSS, the Rankin scale, Barthel index, Rivermead Mobility Index at discharge from the hospital and over one-year follow-up.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Patients with elevated ABI had marked cognitive impairment and more severe neurological deficit compared to patients with normal ABI.
Evaluation of ABI can help in predicting the development of post-stroke cognitive impairment in patients with IS.
