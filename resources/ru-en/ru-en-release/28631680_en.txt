[The influence of retinoids on the regeneration of an open osteal wound].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the influence of retinoid-based pharmaceutical products on the process of regeneration of the tissues surrounding an open osteal wound under the experimental conditions.
The experiments were carried out using 20 'Sovetskaya shinshilla' rabbits (12 males and 8 females).
The animals with the modelled open osteal wound underwent daily treatment by the placement of the dressings impregnated with a mixture of dioxo-methyltetrahydropyrimidine and chloramphenicol ointments supplemented by 0.05% retinoic acid (1:1:1).
The rabbits of the control group were treated using the dressings impregnated only with a mixture of dioxo-methyltetrahydropyrimidine and chloramphenicol ointments containing no retinoic acid.
The study has demonstrated that the application of the retinoid-based medications for the treatment of the open osteal wound resulted in the well apparent positive dynamics of the wound process in comparison with that in the control animals.
It is concluded that the data obtained give evidence that retinoid-based preparations can be used as an adjuvant treatment for the acceleration and promotion of the wound healing process in the trepanation cavity following sanation surgery on the middle ear.
