[Preventive therapy with mexidol in toxic damage to the heart].  The purpose of this study was to efficacy of mexidol in the prevention of toxic damage to the heart in acute pancreatitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The paper presents the results of experimental studies conducted on 30 adult mongrel adult dogs, which simulated acute focal pancreatic necrosis.  We studied the influence of mexidol in the complex therapy for changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of the lipid tissue structures of the heart, the intensity of processes of lipid peroxidation, antioxidant capacity, phospholipase A2 activity and morphofunctional state of the heart muscle in experimental acute focal pancreatic necrosis.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The preventive use of antioxidant drug mexidol in complex treatment of acute focal pancreatic necrosis, which limits the development of endogenous intoxication, increased intensity of lipid peroxidation and restores antioxidant capacity, reduces leading to phospholipase activity in tissue structures of the heart, corrigiruet lipid metabolism and morphofunctional state of the heart, and, consequently, toxic damage to the heart during endotoxic.
