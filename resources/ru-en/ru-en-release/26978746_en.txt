[The state of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses in the children presenting with congenital cleft of upper lip and palate].
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the state of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses in the children presenting with congenital cleft of upper lip and palate (CLP).
A total of 23 children at the age from 9 to 16 years who had undergone the surgical treatment of the above malformations during the first year of life were examined.  The comprehensive study including routine ENT examination, endoscopic examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, and computed tomography has demonstrated that 50% of the patients with congenital cleft of upper lift and palate suffered the deflection of the nasal septum associated with hyperplasia of inferior turbinal bones.
The children with congenital cleft of upper lip and palate were characterized by enhanced pneumatization of the anterior end of the middle turbinate despite the absence of well apparent differences between their paranasal sinuses and those of the healthy children, with the degree of pneumatization being consistent with the patient's age in both groups.
