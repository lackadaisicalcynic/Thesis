[Ophthalmic manifestations of Huntington's disease].  Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene.
The whole nervous system, including visual analyzer, is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.  Various ocular sings can be found in both preclinical and clinical stages of HD.
Specific retinal damage, namely, abnormal proteins formation, photoreceptor degeneration and retinal remodeling, has been studied in animal models.
Functional changes in occipital lobe activity and its atrophy as well as degeneration of visual pathways can already be present in the early stages of the disease.
Oculomotor symptoms of HD include disturbed visual fixation, slower tracking eye movements and saccades, and suppressed vestibulo-ocular reflex.
Visual perceptual disorders, such as visuospatial difficulties, problems of stimulus identification and motion perception, along with decreased contrast sensitivity, have also been described.
The possibility of using certain ophthalmic parameters as biomarkers of HD is being discussed.
