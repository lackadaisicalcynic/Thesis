[Short and medium-term variability of blood pressure in elderly patients with arterial hypertension and predicting the risk of renal dysfunction].  The aim of the work was to specifically identify short and medium variability of blood pressure (BP) in elderly patients with arterial hypertension and to evaluate the prognostic value of fluctuation of BP for the development of renal dysfunction.
64 patients with hypertension were surveyed: a core group of 33 patients with start-AG over the age of 60 years, the control group - 31 patients with uncomplicated hypertension and onset before the age of 60 years.
Variability was evaluated by day, night and diurnal SBP and DBP according to the results of daily monitoring of blood pressure, as well as intra-individual (short-term) and visit-to-visit blood pressure variability (seven consecutive days) (medium-term). The relationship between the parameters of variability of BP and the characteristics of chronic kidney disease was studied.
The elderly hypertension patients demonstrated a higher short-term and medium-term variability of BP.
Increasing medium variability of systolic BP in advanced aged patients is associated with the development of chronic kidney disease.
When the medium-term variability of systolic BP exceeds the level of 9,7 mm Hg, the risk of developing chronic kidney disease increases with a diagnostic sensitivity of 77,1 % and diagnostic specificity of 80,8 %.
