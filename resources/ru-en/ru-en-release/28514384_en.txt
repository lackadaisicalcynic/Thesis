[Innovative endoscopic technologies in multi-field medical facility].  The modern clinical practice is characterized by intensive introduction of innovative technologies for improving treatment and diagnostic procedures, minimizing their impact on the patient, complications rate and economic reasons.
One of the priorities in this area is both diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy.  The degree of practical use of innovative endoscopic technologies depends on not only the quality of care, but also their economic reasons.
Endoscopic treatment has become the method of choice for gastrointestional bleeding, extraction of foreign bodies, obstructive jaundice, polyps of the gastrointestinal tract, achalasia, esophageal strictures, etc.
So, the current state of scientific and technical advances have made minimally invasive surgical intervention one of the main direction of development of surgery.
The further improvement will be considered integration of minimally invasive and information technologies.  The widespread introduction of minimally invasive surgical techniques in clinical practice indicates their undoubted efficiency and availability, especially in the multidisciplinary hospitals that provide various types of specialized high-technological medical care.
This allows to embody the principle of multidisciplinary and personalized approach in the treatment of patients.
The main result of such practices is to reduce the duration of inpatient treatment, a significant reduction in the degree of invasive impact and risk of surgical interventions, diagnostic interventions and operations in a 'one-day hospital', with a total increase of efficiency of surgical treatment, and with high quality of life of patients.
