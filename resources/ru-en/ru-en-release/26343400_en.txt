[Scientific anatomical rationalefor lower teeth local anesthesia].  The article presents clinical recommendation for the choice of local anesthesia techniques in dental treatment of lower teeth based both on original research and literature review.
Several localanesthesiatechniques are described for various teeth group, as well as intraosseousdiffusionoflocal anesthetic at various sites of mandible bone and possible anatomical reasons for local anesthesia failures.
Theresultsofauthor's anatomical and clinical studies confirm that branches of buccal and lingual nerve can provide lower teeth innervation.
Several local anesthesia techniques which may be useful for overcoming the mandibular block failure are proposed.
