[State of immune and cytokine status in acute ulcerative gastroduodenal bleeding].
The paper analyzes the results of a survey of 37 patients with acute ulcerative gastroduodenal hemorrhage.
During endoscopy found that 7 patients the cause of bleeding was gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer in 27 and 3 concomitant ulcer.
Hemostasis was evaluated by J. Forrest and the severity of blood loss was assessed by the A.A. Shalimov: with blood loss was mild in 11 patients, the average degree--12 and with severe--14.
In all patients on admission in the peripheral blood were studied state of cellular, humoral and cytokine profile: CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8 + and CD19+, FI, FF, CEC, IgA, M, G, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10.
In general patients with on admission revealed significant changes in the immune and cytokine status.
In cellular immunity occurs immunosuppression.
Disturbances in humoral immunity manifests itself in increased levels of lymphocytes in blood loss and hardships of all multi-directional changes in the concentration of immunoglobulins depending on the amount of blood loss.
When there is an imbalance in cytokine status, the depth of which depends on the degree of blood loss.
