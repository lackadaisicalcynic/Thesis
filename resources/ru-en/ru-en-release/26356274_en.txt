AIM  To analyze a variant of a combination of psychopathological (subdepressive) state with inflammatory diseases of non-specific infectious origin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The paper was based on the study of 45 patients, aged from 12 to 19 years, examined using psychopathological and follow-up methods.  A detailed somatic examination was performed as well.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Authors described a phenomenon of somatopsychic synergism as a variant of a combination of somatic pathology (adenoviral and coccus infections) with subclinical affective syndromes of cyclothymic and schizophrenic origin.
This phenomenon is opposed to somatopsychic antagonism which is qualified as a specific form of masked subdepressive states predominantly of asthenic/dynamic structure.
