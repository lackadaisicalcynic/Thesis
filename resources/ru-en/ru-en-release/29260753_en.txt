[Clinical and epidemiological features of visceral leishmaniasis in the Republic of Crimea].  The paper analyzes official statistical data, as well as visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases who have visited the Clinical Center, I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, and the results of parasitological studies of the materials submitted to the Reference Center for Monitoring of Leishmaniasis, E.I. Martsinovsky Institute of Medical Parasitology, Tropical and Vector-Borne Diseases.
Account is taken of the observations made by the Central Research Institute of Epidemiology, Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare, and of the literature data available in Russian and foreign (Ukraine) scientific journals and monographs.
During the period of 1932 to 2015, a total of 14 VL cases acquired in the Crimea were notified, of which there were 4 cases of VL concurrent with HIV infection.
The majority of infections occurred in the eastern part of the peninsula.
Given that many areas of Crimea have the status of recreation and annually receive millions of vacationists, it is necessary to conduct a more in-depth study of all aspects of this infection.
