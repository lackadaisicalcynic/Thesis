[Diaphragmatic hernia in elective thoracic surgery].  AIM
To clarify the indications for reconstructive surgery in patients with diaphragmatic hernia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Retrospective trial has included 36 patients with diaphragmatic hernia for the period 1963-2017.
There were 23 (63.9%) women and 13 (36.1%) men.
The majority of patients (83%) underwent surgery at able-bodied age (18-60 years).
27 (75%) patients had hernia of weak diaphragmatic zones, 9 (25%) - posttraumatic hernia.
Diaphragm repair was performed with primary suture.  In 2 cases of posttraumatic hernia mesh endoprosthesis was used.
RESULTS
All patients were discharged.
Postoperative complications arose in 4 (11.1%) patients, including 2 cases of mesh endoprosthesis deployment.
Long-term outcome was followed-up in 15 patients from 6 months to 17 years.
Recurrent hernia was absent in all cases.
CONCLUSION
Primary suture is acceptable for diaphragmatic hernia repair.
Alloplastic repair is indicated for large defect, when primary suture is impossible or risk of its failure is high.
