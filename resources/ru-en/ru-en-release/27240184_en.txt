[The association of the DRD3 gene with Parkinson's disease].  OBJECTIVE  To investigate the association between dopamine receptor DRD3 gene tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and forty-three patients with PD and 96 healthy individuals from the Russian population were examined.
Ten tag SNPs (rs963468, rs2134655, rs9817063, rs324035, rs11721264, rs1800828, rs3773678, rs167770, rs167771, rs7633291) within DRD3 have been genotyped.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Associations between 4 polymorphisms (rs11721264, rs3773678, rs167771, rs324035) and PD have been found.  Our study confirms the involvement of polymorphic features of dopamine receptors genes in the pathophysiology in PD.
