[On the classification of the failure to render medical assistance to the patient].
The authors propose the classification of the failure to render medical assistance to the patient.  At present, much attention is given to the analysis of drawbacks in the provision of medical care to the victims of various human activities.
A variety of classifications of these disadvantageous practices have been proposed.  However, they either only casually deal the problem of failure to render medical assistance to the patient or totally disregard it.
The necessity to develop the new classification of the failure to render medical assistance to the patient arises from the formulation of article 124 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation that requires to evaluate the severity of harm to the health of the patient resulting from the inaction of the person(s) obliged to provide the necessary medical aid.
