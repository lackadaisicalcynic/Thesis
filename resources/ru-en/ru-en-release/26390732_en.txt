[The specific features of diagnosis of mixed-phenotype acute leukemia: A combination of B-cell antigen expressions according to the results of flow cytometry and morphological markers of myeloid differentiation in blast cells: A clinical case].
This rare type of acute leukemia, blast cells of which express myeloid and/or lymphoid markers, is mainly diagnosed using flow cytometric findings.  The paper describes a clinical case of mixed-phenotype acute leukemia, in which B-cell lymphoid antigen expressions were revealed by a flow cytometric technique, while bone marrow morphological specimens showed the signs of myeloid differentiation specific to blast cells.
It is concluded that there is a need for a comprehensive examination of patients with new-onset acute leukemia and for an aggregate analysis of flow cytometric results with morphological and cytochemical findings.
