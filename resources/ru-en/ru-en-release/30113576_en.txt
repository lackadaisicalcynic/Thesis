[The method for the simultaneous registration of several frequency-specific short latency auditory brain-stem responses].  The present article was designed to describe the newly proposed method for the simultaneous registration of several frequency-specific short latency auditory evoked potentials based on the use of the sequences of the maximum length.
The mutual masking between he sequences of different frequency bands was investigated.
The possibility for the simultaneous registration of five responses to the stimuli with the central frequency of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz has ben demonstrated.
