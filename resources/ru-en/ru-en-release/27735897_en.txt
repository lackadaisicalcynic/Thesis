[Correction of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in cardiosurgery using computer-based stimulation programs].  AIM
To evaluate the efficacy of computer-based stimulation programs in the correction of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients with ischemic heart disease in remote period after coronary artery bypass surgery.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 74 patients.
All patients underwent a drug therapy and the rehabilitation course using computer-based stimulation programs (1 time per day for 20 minutes during10 days).
Coronary artery bypass surgery was performed for all patients.
Patients were examined before operation, after 6 and 12 months.
RESULTS  The significant improvement of higher cortical functions assessed with the FAB scale, the Schulte test, associated thinking test, ten-word retrieval test at the first attempt, the Clock drawing test) was revealed in the group using computer-based stimulation programs in comparison with the control group.
CONCLUSION  It is found that rehabilitation course using computer-based stimulation programs in patients with ischemic heart disease after coronary artery bypass surgery is the effective method of cognitive function correction.
