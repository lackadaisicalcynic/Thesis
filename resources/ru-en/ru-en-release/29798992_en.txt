[Compression anastomoses with nikelid-titanium rings in peritonitis].  AIM
To introduce into clinical practice compression anastomosis with nikelid-titanium rings (NTR) with shape memory in advanced peritonitis patients who need for intestinal resections.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Seventy-six procedures of interintestinal anastomoses with NTR (Günter-Ziganshin implant) have been analyzed for the period 2011-2017.  Interventions were carried out for widespread peritonitis.
In all cases a unified technique of anastomosis was used by applying an implant in the form of a 'clerical clip'.  There were following procedures: gastroenterostomy resection for its failure - 5; small intestine resection followed by interntestinal anastomosis - 36; ileotransverso- or colocolostomy - 35.
RESULTS
Mean time of enteroenterostomy was 2.6±0.98 min. If elective re-laparomy was supposed, laparostomy was formed followed by sanation within 48 hours.
In 55% of patients 3-5-fold elective sanations were performed.
Adequacy of compression anastomoses was assessed clinically according to the nature of drainage output and visually during redo surgery.
There were 11 (14.5%) deaths: 9 (12%) patients had APACHE-II score over 20.
Macro- and microscopic analysis of intestinal specimens and interintestinal anastomoses with nikelid-titanium rings showed complete impermeability and no visual defects.  Microscopically neutrophilic leukocyte infiltration and increased number of fibroblasts were observed as the evidence of regenerative processes activation.
Implant rejection time was 7.8±1.4 days.
CONCLUSION
The use of compression anastomoses in case of advanced peritonitis reduces the risk of anastomosis failure to 3% and decreases time of surgery that reduces intraoperative aggression and improves outcomes in patients with prognostically unfavorable outcomes.
