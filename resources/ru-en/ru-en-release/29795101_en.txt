[Age related molecular-genetic preconditions for dental caries in pregnant women].  The aim of the study was to evaluate the allelic polymorphisms kallikrein-4 (KLK-4) gene at the mutant points: G2664153A and G2142A in pregnant women under and over 30 of age.
In pregnant women with KLK-4 gene polymorphisms A/A and G/A genotypes the rate of tooth decay growth increases in spite of applying the ternary calcium-phosphate-fluoride-containing gel.  This genotype is also associates with unfavorable alteration of such oral fluid indicators as pH, concentrations of inorganic phosphorus, the active concentrations of calcium and potassium, as well as the ratio of total calcium and phosphorus concentrations, the active concentrations of electrolytes, and demineralizing activity of oral fluid.
