AIM  to comparatively evaluate the hypotensive effect of minimally invasive (type 1) and basic (type 2) subscleral removing of the external wall of Schlemm's canal with subsequent laser trabeculopuncture in patients with open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The main group included 60 patients (64 eyes) treated with the minimally invasive technique.
The control group included 105 patients (105 eyes), who underwent the type 2 surgery.
RESULTS
After sinusotomy, intraocular pressure (IOP) decreased by 25% of its preoperative values in most patients (in 90.6% of patients from the main group and 81.9% of the controls, p<0.05).
After laser trabeculopuncture, IOP further decreased down to 15.6±0.4 mmHg in the main group and 17.4±0.3 mmHg in the control group (p<0.05).
Twelve months after the combined treatment, the hypotensive effect was still present in 81.2% of patients from the main group and 90.5% of the controls.  None of the patients required additional hypotensive therapy.
CONCLUSION
In POAG patients, the effect of minimally invasive subscleral removal of the external wall of Schlemm's canal (microfistulazing procedure) followed by laser trabeculopuncture is no weaker than that of basic technique.
