[A modern approach to the diagnosis of nasal liquorrhea].  Nasal liquorrhea is cerebrospinal fluid leakage from cerebrospinal fluid spaces of the cerebral cavity into the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses due to congenital or acquired abnormalities of the skull base bones and meninges of various etiologies.
The severity of liquorrhea varies from hidden manifestations to profuse leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the nasal cavity.  The diagnosis of overt nasal liquorrhea is not problematic, but the diagnosis of latent liquorrhea is a challenge.
In this case, the disease leads to potentially fatal complications, such as meningitis (the risk amounts to 10-37%), pneumocephaly, pneumonia, etc. These peculiarites give rise to two main tasks: early diagnosis confirming liquorrhea and accurate identification of the CSF fistula location when planning further surgical management.
PURPOSE
The study purpose was to review and comparatively analyze all modern methods of diagnosing nasal liquorrhea as well as to substantiate the most effective and promising approaches and algorithms.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included papers in English and Russian found in the Pubmed database and related to the diagnosis of basal liquorrhea of different etiology and localization.  RESULTS
This review demonstrates that diagnostic tests vary widely in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, invasiveness, and cost.  Given all the criteria, detection of beta-2 transferrin or beta-trace protein is the best method for confirming nasal liquorrhea, and high-resolution computed tomography is the best technique for localization of the abnormality.
CONCLUSION
Based on the review, we suggest a diagnostic algorithm for nasal liquorrhea.
However, the evidence presented in this review is unfortunately not very reliable, which indicates the existing need for more accurate studies.
