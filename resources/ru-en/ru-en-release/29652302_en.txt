[Results of a multicenter study on the efficacy of cortexin in treatment of cognitive dysfunction in children].
AIM  To study the efficacy and tolerability of cortexin in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 635 patients, aged 3-7 years.  Patients were divided into 4 clinical groups: group 1 (269 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)), group 2 (215 children with speech delay), group 3 (82 patients with the consequences of a perinatal lesion of the central nervous system), group 4 (69 patients with asthenic/neurotic syndrome).
Attention, visual memory and thinking were assessed before and after treatment.
Standard treatment of cortexin, including 10 intramuscular injections, was used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The reliable effect of cortexin on cognitive impairment was shown.
The best response to treatment was observed in patients with ADHD, aged 3-4 years, in particular on the tests measuring thinking.
The tolerability of cortexin was good.
It has been concluded that cortexin is an effective drug for treatment of children with ADHD, speech delay and consequences of a perinatal lesion of the central nervous system.
