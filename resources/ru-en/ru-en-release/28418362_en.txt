[Individual learning curves for microsurgical myocardial revascularization].  AIM
To create individual learning curves for microsurgical myocardial revascularization.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  It was analyzed duration of the individual stages of the first 100 CABG procedures which were performed using microsurgical technique and surgical microscope.
Graphs reflecting correlation between duration of the individual surgical stages and their number were framed.
RESULTS
Improvement in distal anastomosis time, aortic cross-clamping time, cardiopulmonary bypass time and duration of surgery was observed with increased surgeon's experience.
CONCLUSION
Individual learning curves objectively characterize the learning process of microsurgical myocardial revascularization, allow to estimate the time need for improvement of cardiac surgeons' qualification and demonstrate dates for achieving average surgical quality during learning the technique.
