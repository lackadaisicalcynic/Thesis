[Videolaparoscopy in diagnosis and treatment of diseases simulating acute appendicitis].  AIM
To analyze videolaparoscopic diagnosis and treatment of abdominal pathology simulating acute appendicitis (AA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  For the period 2008-2015 at Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Care 2784 patients with suspected AA underwent clinical, laboratory and ultrasonic examination.
Depending on survey results patients were divided into 2 groups.
Group I included 1352 (48.6%) patients with AA, group II - 1432 (51.4%) patients with suspected AA.
All of them underwent videolaparoscopy.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Videolaparoscopy confirmed AA in 1308 (96.7%) patients of group I and 856 (59,8%) patients of group II.
In the 1st group 36 (2.7%) patients had pathology simulating AA and 8 (0.6%) patients had not organic changes; in the 2nd group these values were 462 (32.3%) and 114 (7.9%) respectively.
Absence of organic changes was explained by functional bowel disorders.
In 95 (3.4%) out of 498 (17.9%) patients of both groups with simulating diseases videolaparoscopy was made and in 49 (1.8%) cases indications for laparotomy were established.
In 354 (12.7%) patients with simulating diseases and 122 (4.4%) patients without organic changes operations were not carried out.
CONCLUSION
Videolaparoscopy in patients scheduled for appendectomy or with unclear clinical picture allows to diagnose various forms of AA, simulating diseases and to perform necessary surgery.
