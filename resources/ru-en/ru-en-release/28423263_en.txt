[EXPERIENCE WITH THE USE OF EPTIFIBATIDE IN ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME DURING CORONARY INTERVENTION IN PATIENTS OLDER AGE GROUP].
Acute coronary syndrome is the leading cause of death in patients older age group.
Primary PCI is nearly uncontested revascularization method because of its efficacy in reperfusion achievement and less hemorrhagic complications compared to systemic thrombolytic therapy.  Nevertheless, the age of the patients is a significant bleeding risk factor, sophisticating the choice and dosing antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy during coronary angioplasty and stenting.
Blocker 2b/3a receptor eptifibatide are used to avoids the development of ischemic complications and improves myocardial perfusion, but accompanied with bleeding risk during common infusion (12-18 hours).  Combined intracoronary and intravenous infusion eptifibatide during only coronary intervention enhance procedure safety.
