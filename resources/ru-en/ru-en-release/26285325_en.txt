[The role of the respiratory and relaxation training in the treatment of the patients after the surgical treatment of non-specific pulmonary diseases].  The present study included 62 patients who had undergone the surgical intervention for the treatment of non-specific pulmonary diseases.
All the patients were subjected to the psychological and spirometric examination.  The study has demonstrated the relationship between the characteristics of the external respiration function on the one hand and the ability to handle stress, the levels of anxiety, tension, emotional instability and hypochondriacal mood on the other hand.
It was shown that the respiratory and relaxation training improves the effectiveness of the treatment of the patients presenting with such symptoms due to the correction of their psychological status and optimization of the external respiration function.
The highest effectiveness of the respiratory and relaxation training was documented in the patients suffering moderate neurotic disorders.
