[A case report of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease].  The familial form of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (ffCJD) refers to a group of rare and severe neurodegenerative diseases associated with pathologic prion protein accumulation.
The cause of disease is genetically determined.
The disease has a continuously progressive course leading to death in 100% of cases.  The symptoms of dementia dominate in the clinical picture.
The authors describe a clinical case of subacute dementia in a 32-year-old patient.
The disease had a progressive course.  A preliminary diagnosis of ffCJD was established after neurological, psychiatric, genetic examinations and dynamic observation.
The diagnosis met the following criteria of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC: progressive dementia, extrapyramidal disorders, absence of special EEG complexes, disease duration less than 2-3 years, confirmed genetic mutation in the prion protein gene, bilateral hyper intensive signals in the caudate nuclei region, the thalami on T2-weighted images (a 'honeycomb' symptom), atrophy of the cerebral cortex and cortex cerebelli on diffusion-weighted brain MRI (DWI).
The patients died 3 years after the onset of the disease.
The pathological signs of neuron spongiform degeneration as important characteristics of the disease were found at autopsy.
