AIM  To improve surgical treatment of patients with cholelithiasis and obesity by using of different technologies of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 88 (16.4%) patients with overweight and obesity among 538 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 33 (6.1%) cases, cholecystectomy through single laparoscopic access - in 12 (2.3%), cholecystectomy via single laparoscopic access with trocar support - in 43 (8.0%) patients with body mass index 25-52.3 kg/m2.
The article describes the technical features of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
RESULTS
Complications were absent in 83 (94.3%) of 88 cases after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
The lowest pain severity in early postoperative period was noted in case of single laparoscopic access (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION
Conventional and single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is advisable in patients with calculous cholecystitis, overweight and obesity.
