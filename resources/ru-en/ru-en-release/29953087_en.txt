[Dome-shaped macula: features of differential diagnostics with clinical examples].  The phenomenon of dome-shaped macula (DSM) constitutes protrusion of membranes of the posterior pole of the eye toward the vitreous body due to local thickening of sclera layers.
The phenomenon was detected using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).
In uncomplicated forms of DSM, all layers of the retina are contiguous, but the setting of DSM can involve a number of pathological conditions causing decrease in vision.
One of the most often described concurrent conditions in DSM is serous retinal detachment (SRD).
Such complicated forms of DSM are often masked as a non-pigmented neoplasm of the choroid, in particular hemangioma (HC).
PURPOSE  To demonstrate the possibilities of differential diagnostics of DSM with HC using modern instrumental diagnostic methods.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved two clinical cases of patients with DSM and HC, who underwent comprehensive ophthalmological examination including EDI-OCT and OCT angiography, fluorescent angiography (FA), indocyanine-green angiography (ICG) and magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits (MRI).
RESULTS
The most simple and highly informative method for differential diagnostic of DSM with HC is currently EDI-OCT.  In difficult differential diagnostic cases, it is recommended to use FA and MRI.
Additionally, for identification of the cause of SRD in DSM, OCT-angiography and ICG-angiography can be used.
Thus, diagnostics of DSM is difficult today primarily because of the low awareness of ophthalmologists about the presence of such macula pathology.
Detection of this anatomical feature by means of ophthalmoscopy alone can be difficult and requires special skills and experience.
The use of EDI-OCT, as well as FA and MRI in difficult differential diagnostic cases, and correct interpretation of the obtained data can help avoid diagnostic errors.
