[The 'axial' method of teeth preparation for fixed partial and telescopic dentures].  The article describes the method preparation of teeth which would be united by single construction of prosthesis.
The proposed method has 2 features from the currently known methods.  Firstly, axial preparation lines are applied on each abutment teeth by using needle narrow diamond bur.
Lines could be performed on 3 walls of abutment teeth (vestibular, occlusal, lingval) and should be parallel each other.  Secondly, the mirror for intraoral dental photography is used during the preparation by this method.
The large surface of this mirror allows to see several teeth at the same time.  The mirror is placed in the mouth at different angles which helps to accurately visualize the convergence all walls of abutment teeth.
The advantage of this method is ability to use a microscope or binoculars for magnification during preparation.
