AIM  To study the possibility of antibacterial therapy for acute appendicitis as an alternative to surgical treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period 1985-2010 diagnostic laparoscopy was performed in 5548 patients with suspected acute appendicitis.
Acute phlegmonous or gangrenous appendicitis was observed in 2275 (41.0%) patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy.
Other acute diseases occurred in 2458 (44.3%) patients.
Acute catarrhal appendicitis or secondary inflammation of the appendix were diagnosed in 815 (14.7%) patients; they did not get appendectomy.  In-hospital antibacterial therapy has been administered for 1-2 days followed by discharge for outpatient treatment.
One patient with acute destructive appendicitis who refused surgery was treated with antibiotics.
RESULTS
Antibacterial therapy in 815 patients with acute catarrhal appendicitis allowed to avoid surgical treatment.
Complications (appendicular infiltration, abscess), repeated hospitalizations within 1 month were absent.
Antibacterial treatment provided recovery in 1 patient with destructive appendicitis who refused surgical treatment.
CONCLUSION
Patients with acute catarrhal appendicitis diagnosed with laparoscopy do not need for appendectomy and can be cured by antibacterial therapy.
