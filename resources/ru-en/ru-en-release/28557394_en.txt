[Age-related changes of peripheral nerve system and muscles of the limbs in healthy persons].  Our aim was to present and analyze age-related changes of peripheral nerves and muscles of limbs on a huge population of healthy persons of different ages.
Persons aged from 2 months to 87 years were studied by conduction studies (EMG) during the period 2009-2016 years in Scientific Research Institute of Children's Infection.  Data of those 1 121confirmed healthy was included in our study.
Conduction along n.  Medianus, n.
Musculocutaneus, n.  Axillaris, n.
Peroneus et n.  Femoralis was registered, with latency and amplitude of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) being analyzed.
There were significant differences on latencies and amplitudes of CMAPs between different age groups.
Significant lengthening of CMAP latency was registered in older age groups.  We marked CMAP amplitude increase from the early childhood until adolescence and later it dropped in persons aged 55 years old and older.
These changes may reflect, concerning latency, the lengthening of the peripheral nerves in the age 0-25 years, and later on age-related slowing of conduction starting from 55 years.  Amplitude of CMAP may rise with the growing of muscles and drop in later life with age-related muscle atrophy and fibrous changes.
