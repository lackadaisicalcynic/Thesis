[Peculiarities of secretion of cytokines and chemokines by human blood monocytes in atherosclerosis].  The study included apparently healthy people, conventionally healthy people predisposed to atherosclerosis, and as well as people with preclinical atherosclerosis (50 subjects in each group).
Monocytes were isolated from whole blood and transferred to culture followed by studying pro- and anti-inflammatory activation of monocytes in response to stimulation by interferon-gamma and interleukin-4, respectively.
As a marker of pro-inflammatory activation was the level of secretion of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the culture medium measured by means of immunoenzymatic assay.
Chemokine CCL18 served as a marker of anti-inflammatory activation.
We also examined secretion of a series of other chemokines and cytokines: MCO-1, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, GM-CFS, and others.
Pronounced individual differences of cytokines and chemokines secretion were revealed in all groups.
We carried out assessment the degree of altering secretion of cytokines and chemokines by stimulated monocytes compared with unstimulated culture.
This approach may serve as an effective tool for assessment an individual reaction of congenital immunity.
