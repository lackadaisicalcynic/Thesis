[Spectrophotometric method for objective focal enamel demineralization diagnostics].  The article presents the results of spectrophotometric tooth enamel scanning.
Research was conducted in vitro on extracted teeth.
Numeric color parameters measurements were made by VITA EasyShade spectrophotometer after the 37% phosphoric acid enamel conditioning, that was made for an artificial tooth enamel demineralization reconstruction.  Then transverse section of this enamel part was evaluated by scanning electronic microscopy.
The scale of enamel demineralization depth in mm/microns and its' lightness parameter compliance was created.
