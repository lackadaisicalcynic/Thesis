The Global Drug Facility as an intervention in the market for tuberculosis drugs.
OBJECTIVE  To investigate funding for the Global Drug Facility since 2001 and to analyse the facility's influence on the price of high-quality tuberculosis drugs.
METHODS
Data on the price of tuberculosis drugs were obtained from the Global Drug Facility for 2001 to 2012 and, for the private sector in 15 countries, from IMS Health for 2002 to 2012.
Data on funding of the facility were also collected.
FINDINGS
Quality-assured tuberculosis drugs supplied by the Global Drug Facility were generally priced lower than drugs purchased in the private sector.  In 2012, just three manufacturers accounted for 29.9 million United Stated dollars (US$) of US$ 44.5 million by value of first-line drugs supplied.
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria provided 73% (US$ 32.5 million of US$ 44.5 million) and 89% (US$ 57.8 million of US $65.2 million) of funds for first- and second-line drugs, respectively.
Between 2010 and 2012, the facility's market share of second-line tuberculosis drugs increased from 26.1% to 42.9%, while prices decreased by as much as 24% (from US$ 1231 to US$ 939).
Conversely, the facility's market share of first-line drugs fell from 37.2% to 19.2% during this time, while prices increased from US$ 9.53 to US$ 10.2.
CONCLUSION
The price of tuberculosis drugs supplied through the facility was generally less than that on the private market.
However, to realize its full potential and meet the needs of more tuberculosis patients, the facility requires more diverse and stable public funding and greater flexibility to participate in the private market.
