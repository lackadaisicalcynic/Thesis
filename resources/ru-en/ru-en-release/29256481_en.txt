[The efficient method for the forensic medical investigation of the thoracic wound channels for the reconstruction of the victim's body position at the moment of injury].  The objective of the present study was the development of the expert action algorithm for the purpose of forensic medical expertise of a corpse with punctured, stab and slash, and gunshot wounds with the purpose of reconstruction of the victim's body position at the moment of injury.
The following methods were proposed based on the results of the study: the method for the access to the internal organs of the corpse allowing to preserve the configuration of the thoracic wound channels during the full-scale autopsy for its subsequent evaluation and the method for the reconstruction of the initial shape of the wound channels in the body and the extremities and thereby to facilitate the forensic medical expertise examination of the corpse.  In addition, the real-world examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to the planning, organization, and performance of the expert actions for the purpose of the reconstruction of the victim's body position at the moment of injury.
