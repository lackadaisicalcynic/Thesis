[Dynamics of health and aging rate of patients of different age and sex in the treatment of moderate multiple pathologies].
The article presents results of investigation of the dynamics of health status of patients of different age and sex, with several non-serious diseases, in the course of their treatment in the hospital, as well as the determination of their biological age before and after the course of treatment.  The clear differences in the number of diseases, their nature, duration of the treatment and its effectiveness depending on age and sex were revealed.
However, at the age of older than 60 years these differences gradually disappearing.  Multiple, although non-serious, pathology has a negative impact on the indicators of the biological age of men in the calendar age of 20-39 years and women in the calendar age of 20-39 and older than 60 years, but the rejuvenating effect of the treatment is extremely low.
In a number of cases, in the process of treatment of multiple pathologies the indicators of initially reduced biological age get even higher and adapt to the indicators of the calendar age.  The authors explain this from the position of the disturbed by the treatment adaptation of the organism to easy disease, as well as the opportunity of reviewing the biological age significantly reduced in relation to the calendar age as a pathological phenomenon similar to significantly increased biological age.
