[The depressive disorders during the early rehabilitation period following preceding ischemic stroke: the possibilities for the application of the enhanced external counterpulsation method].  The authors present arguments in favour of the necessity to reveal and treat the co-morbid conditions with special reference to depressive disorders in the patients during the early rehabilitation period following preceding ischemic stroke.
They demonstrate the importance of the application of non-medicamentous therapy in combination with the standard medicamental treatment.
Special emphasis is placed on the analysis of the data obtained during evaluation of the effectiveness of combined therapy with the use of the enhanced external counterpulsation method in the early post-stroke period.
It is concluded that the early diagnostics and timely correction of anxio-depressive conditions promotes the efficiency of rehabilitative measures and improves the quality of life of the patients with such disorders.
