[Extradural spinal cord hemangioblastoma (a case report and literature review)].  Hemangioblastoma is a rare CNS vascular tumor that develops sporadically and can also be associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease.
Hemangioblastomas account for 2-6% of all spinal cord tumors and are ranked third in the structure of intramedullary space-occupying lesions of the spinal cord.
For the first time in our practice, we observed a dumbbell paravertebral hemangioblastoma.
The international literature reports only 3 cases of the tumor with this growth type.
