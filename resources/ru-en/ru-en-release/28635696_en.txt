[Combined surgical treatment of cavernous internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm].  We describe a clinical case of surgical treatment of a cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) pseudoaneurysm that developed due to damage to the artery during transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.
Clinically, the aneurysm presented with episodes of profuse epistaxis that required tight nasal packing.
Given the presence of an open circle of Willis, the patient underwent staged surgery that included the creation of a high-flow extra-intracranial anastomosis, subsequent endovascular ICA occlusion at the pseudoaneurysm level using balloon-assisted coiling, and endoscopic debridement of the nasal cavity.
The combined surgical treatment of this rare complication successfully excluded the pseudoaneurysm from the bloodstream, which led to complete regression of nasal bleeding.
