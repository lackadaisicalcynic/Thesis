[The classifying criteria for the evaluation of the severity of the harm to health in the case of development of psychic health problems associated with HIV infection].  The objective of the present study was to develop the classifying criteria for the evaluation of the severity of the harm inflicted to human health that resulted in the development of mental disorders in response to subsequent HIV infection.
The analysis of the available information about a rise in the prevalence of HIV infection and the high frequency of associated psychic disorders among the infected subjects gave evidence of the importance of this problem and the necessity to improve the existing statutory and legislative basis underlying the regulation of activities in this field.
The scientifically substantiated criteria for the expert assessment of the severity of the harm to human health are proposed taking into consideration the clinical manifestations of psychic disorders.
