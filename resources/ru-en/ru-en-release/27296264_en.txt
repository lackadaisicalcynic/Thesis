[Examination of skin autofluorescence for the determination of glycation end-products in patients on chronic hemodialysis].
AIM
To assess the results of determination of glycation end-products (GEPs) by skin autofluorescence (AF) in patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A device made in Russia was used to estimate skin AF intensity in 40 apparently healthy individuals and in 76 patients treated with chronic HD.
While analyzing the findings, comparisons were made in both groups; a relationship between skin AF intensity and clinical and laboratory parameters was also investigated in patients on HD.
RESULTS  The intensity of AF in the patients treated with chronic HD proved to be significantly higher than that in the control group.
There was a direct correlation of the intensity of AF with age in both groups and that with the duration of dialysis treatment in patients on HD.
In patients with coronary heart disease, the intensity of AF was significantly higher than in those without this condition.  The intensity of AF directly correlated with the Charlson comorbidity index in the patients on HD.
There were no correlations of skin AF intensity with main generally detected laboratory blood indicators, body mass index, and the nature of drug therapy in the patients on HD.  CONCLUSION
Tissue GEP levels may serve as a cumulative index of metabolic stress in HD patients.  The determination of GEP by measuring the intensity of skin AF may be used to assess prognosis in patients treated with chronic HD.
