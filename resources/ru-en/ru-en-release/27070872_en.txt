AIM  To study the results of surgical and combined treatment of non-small cell lung cancer stage III using preoperative chemotherapy and intraoperative radiotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 152 patients with non-small cell lung cancer stage III. Overall and recurrence-free 5-year survival were 20.4% and 14.3% respectively.
These values were significantly higher in case of combined treatment consisting of radical surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy (29.2% and 18.7% respectively, p<0.05).  RESULTS
The best results were obtained in case of preoperative chemotherapy with paclitaxel/carboplatin, radical surgery and intraoperative radiotherapy on background of radiosensitization with cisplatin.  Overall and recurrence-free 5-year survival were 47.9% and 41.7% respectively (p<0.05).
Incidence of postoperative complications and mortality rate did not significantly differ between surgical and combined treatment (p>0.05).
