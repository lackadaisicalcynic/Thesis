[Seton drainage in sphincter-sparing treatment of rectal fistulas].  Sphincter-sparing procedures for rectal fistulas are becoming more popular among coloproctologists.
However, the outcomes are not optimal that forces surgeons to seek new approaches in order to improve results.
Seton drainage prior to radical stage is one of these methods.  The effect of seton drainage on the outcomes is reviewed in the article.
Elibrary, Pubmed and Google Scholar databases were analyzed.  We have assessed 14 out of 151 trials for the period 1984 - 2017.
There were no significant advantages of seton drainage compared with single-stage approach (Ï‡2 = 3.84, p> 0.05, RR = 0.95, CI 95% 0.84 - 1.08).  The same situation is observed for mucomuscular flap bringing down to close internal fistula.
Fistula healing was more common after seton drainage deployment within 4 - 8 weeks.  Bringing down of the flap to anal canal should be preferred after drainage due to less incidence of recurrences.
Further trials are necessary to determine advisability of seton drainage and optimal surgical approach.
