[Cytokines in surgery for pulmonary tuberculosis].  AIM
To evaluate the effect of various methods of thoracoplasty on local production of cytokines in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The main group consisted of patients after traditional thoracoplasty.
Thoracoplasty was compared with endoprosthesis of polypropylene mesh 'Surgipro - SPMM-149'.  TNF-Î± and IL-10 cytokines in exudate from surgical area were measured by using of solid-phase enzyme immunoassay (OOO 'Vector-Best', Russia).
RESULTS
It was revealed that local production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is more pronounced after thoracoplasty with polypropylene mesh 'Surgipro - SPMM-149'.
Local cytokine balance changes towards inflammation were more pronounced after thoracoplasty with mesh implant and did not depend on the degree of drug sensitivity.
