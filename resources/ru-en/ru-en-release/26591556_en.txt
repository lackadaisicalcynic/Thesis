[Pleiotropic effects of atorvastatin in rheumatoid arthritis patients with no history of cardiovascular diseases].
AIM  To evaluate the effect of atorvastatin (liprimar) on the laboratory values of inflammation and blood lipid composition in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with no history of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).
Subjects and methods.
Fifty women with grade II RA activity according to DAS28 and radiologic (erosive) Stages I-III were examined; the patients were not former or current smokers; all were seropositive; their mean age was 50.2±9.9 years.  All the patients with RA were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 took no atorvastatin and continued to receive standard previously prescribed therapy; Group 2 used atorvastatin in a dose of 20 mg.
Lipidogram readings and the levels of Apo-A and Apo-B, neopterin, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, sP-selectin, sE-selectin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, and matrix metalloproteinases 3 and 9 were assessed.  RESULTS
The patients with RA show obvious blood lipid composition impairments.  Incorporation of atorvastatin (liprimar) into combination therapy for RA not only causes a considerable reduction in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apo-B levels, but also positively affects the inflammatory activity of the disease, by lowering the level of proinflammatory cytokines and increasing that of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
CONCLUSION
The above changes may underlie the prevention of CVD complications in patients with RA.
