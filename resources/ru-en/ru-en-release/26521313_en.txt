[The possibilities for the use of unusual personality traits in the examination of the skeletonized corpses with the long prescription of burying].  The objective of the present study was to develop the method for the detection and identification of the traces of the previous diseases on the skeletonized and mummified corpses with the purpose of discovery of the new specific traits making possible the personality identification and substantiation of the search of their localization at the burial places depending on the prescription of burying.
It was shown that the identification of the corpses under conditions of their complete skeletonization should be based not only on the general (sex, age, height) but also the specific (congenital malformations, post-traumatic and pathological changes of the bones) traits.
The biological structures making possible the personality identification are described, such as the mineralized (petrified) fibrous capsules of the hepatic echinoccocus vesicles, the primary lung tuberculosis complex, and postoperative scar ossificates of the abdominal white tine.
Some data on the lifetime of bone remains in the ground and the duration of their possible skeletonization are presented together with the description of the method for the use of this information with a view to the personality identification of the unknown corpse.
