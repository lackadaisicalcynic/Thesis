[The substantiation for simultaneous rhinoplasty and correction of the intranasal structures in the patients presenting with the combination of pathology of the nasal cavity and disfigurement of the shape of the nose].
The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effectiveness of rhinoplasty performed in the combination with the correction of the intranasal structures.  The study included the comparison of intra- and post-operative characteristics of rhinoplasty carried out with and without correction of the intranasal structures in 374 patients presenting with the combination of pathology of the nasal cavity and disfigurement of the shape of the nose.
It was shown that the simultaneous surgical interventions are not accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of intra- and post-operative complications in comparison with rhinoplastic surgery alone; nor do they require additional time expenditures.  At the same time, the absence or the inadequate performance of septoplasty and/or the correction of the inferior turbinated bone during rhinoplasty in the patients presenting with the combination of pathology of the nasal cavity and disfigurement of the shape of the nose is fraught with the poor aesthetic outcome of the treatment and persistent disturbances of the respiratory function.
