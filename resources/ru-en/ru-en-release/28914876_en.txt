[An aneurysm of the medial posterior choroidal artery: a case report and a literature review].  INTRODUCTION
Aneurysms of the medial posterior choroidal artery are very rare.  To date, only 5 cases have been reported.
The article presents a case of successful surgical treatment of an aneurysm of the medial posterior choroidal artery and a literature review.  CLINICAL CASE
A 57-year-old male was admitted to the Center 1 month after a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage.  CT angiography revealed an aneurysm of the right posterior medial choroidal artery in the perimesencephalic cistern and resolved hemorrhage.
TREATMENT
The paramedian supracerebellar transtentorial approach to the lateral surface of the midbrain was used.
The posterior cerebral artery was identified in the perimesencephalic cistern, and the medial posterior choroidal artery aneurysm was isolated and successfully clipped, with the parent artery being preserved.
Postoperative CT and MRI scans revealed a small asymptomatic ischemic lesion in the tectal region on the right.
The patient was discharged without any neurological symptoms 10 days after surgery.
CONCLUSION
Medial posterior choroidal artery aneurysms can be clipped using the paramedian supracerebellar transtentorial approach.
