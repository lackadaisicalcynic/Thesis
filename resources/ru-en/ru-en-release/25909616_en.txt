[Microbiological aspects of zirconia orthopedic structures].  The article gives a detailed analysis of oral cavity microbiological aspects of 23 patients before and after prosthetic treatment with zirconia structures.
Microbiocenoses of oral cavity in patients with defects of the dentition can be described as disbiotic.
It was found that the incidence of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria was increased and frequency of occurrence of pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, was decreased under the influence of temporary plastic prosthesis as an intermediate step prosthetics.  After applying prosthetic zirconia an increase of the normal biotopes number was seen, as well as reduce in the number of Staphylococcus aureus and the yeast fungus Candida to less than 4 lg CFU/ml.
Such amounts do not cause inflammation in the oral cavity.
