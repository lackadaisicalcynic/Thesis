[Regeneration of dental pulp tissue using pulpal autologous mesenchymal stem cells and platelet-rich plasma].  Regeneration of pulp and dentin could be important in operative dentistry as a method to save teeth.
Currently cell population from dental pulp of deciduous and permanent teeth of humans and laboratory animals are isolated and characterized.
The paper presents a study on pulp regeneration using autologous mesenchymal stromal cells from pulp of molars in combination with fibrin clot, transplanted in pulp chamber of miniature pigs after pulp removal.  The results proved that transplantation of autologous multipotent stromal cells of dental pulp in combination with autologous platelet-rich plasma in pulp chamber of miniature pigs after pulp removal leads to pulp restoration and reparative dentinogenesis with dentinal bridge formation on the 30th day.
However, the completion of regeneration also results in a decrease in the pulp chamber volume due to the neodentin bedding.  Tissue regeneration of dental pulp by direct pulp capping in the absence of inflammatory processes is a promising direction of the use of cellular technologies.
