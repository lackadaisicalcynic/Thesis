[The role of respiratory viruses in etiology of rhinosinisitis in the children].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the role of respiratory viruses in etiology of acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) in the children and adolescents.
We analysed the results of a microbiologial study of 50 aspirates from the paranasl sinuses.
It was shown that acute rhinosinusitis had bacterial and viral-bacterial etiology in 8% and 24% of the cases respectively.
In 42% of the cases the pathogen could not be identified by any of the methods used in the study.
