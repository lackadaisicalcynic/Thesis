[Endoscopic treatment of intestinal malrotation in newborns and infants].
AIM  To compare treatment of intestinal malrotation in newborns and infants using laparoscopy and laparotomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period from January 2004 to December 2013 34 Ladd's procedures were performed.
Children were divided into 2 groups by 17 patients: laparoscopic (group I) and open treatment (group II).
RESULTS
Both groups had similar demographic and other preoperative parameters.
There were significant differences in duration of operation between both groups (61 vs. 70 minutes).
Nutrition was initiated earlier after mini-invasive treatment (1.5 days vs. 3 days) and the time need for full enteral nutrition was also less (4.2 days vs. 6.9 days).
Hospital-stay was shorter in group I (7.7 vs. 10.2 days).
Number of early postoperative complications was similar in groups.
Incidence of remote complications was higher in laparotomy group but the differences were not significant.
CONCLUSION
Our results showed that endoscopic correction of congenital anomalies of intestinal rotation provides better postoperative results than open surgery and can be widely used in young children.
