[Role of telocytes in the heart in health and diseases].  This review summarizes the data available in the literature on the development, structure, and function of telocytes (TCs) and their role in the heart in health and diseases.
At the present time, TCs have been found in many organs of mammals and humans.  TC is a small oval cell that contains a nucleus surrounded by small amounts of cytoplasm, with extremely long and thin processes named telopodias.
TCs have unique ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features; double positive labeling for CD34/PDGFR-Î² and CD34/vimentin is suitable for their identification.
The role of TCs in the heart at different study stages is the subject of debate.
There are currently available data on a decline in the number of cardiac TCs in patients with various heart diseases.
Relying on a number of investigations showing that TCs are present in the subepicardial stem cell niches, the authors consider a hypothesis for the key role of cardiac TCs in the regeneration and reparation of the heart.
