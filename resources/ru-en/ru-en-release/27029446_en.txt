[Optimization of hypolipidemic therapy in patients with ischemic stroke and diabetes mellitus].  OBJECTIVES
Evaluation of effectiveness of Mexidol in optimization of hypolipidemic therapy in ischemic stroke and diabetes mellitus patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Authors analyzed the indicators of lipid status: total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins, triglycerides and concentration of platelet factor-4, Î²-tromboglobulin, von Willebrand factor in 68 patients with acute ischemic stroke and diabetes mellitus.
Authors investigate the dynamics of these parameters (1(st), 21(st), 3-d and 6(th) month after onset stroke) depending on timing and dose of Mexidol.
RESULTS
Long time therapy of Mexidol may optimize of hypolipidemic therapy in ischemic stroke and diabetes mellitus patients.
