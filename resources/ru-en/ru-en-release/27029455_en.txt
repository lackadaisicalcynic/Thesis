[The possibility of using immunological parameters for the evaluation of the clinical state of patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia].  OBJECTIVE
To compare clinical and immunological parameters in children with schizophrenia and to analyze the possibility of using them in the assessment of the pathological process activity.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 62 patients, 39 boys and 23 girls, aged from 4 to 17 years, with childhood-onset schizophrenia.
Mental state of the patients was assessed using a psychopathological method and with PANSS and CGI scales.
The activity of leukocyte elastase (LE) and alpha(1)-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) was measured by spectrophotometric method.
ELISA was used to determine the level of autoantibodies to neuroantigenes to S-100B and basic myelin protein.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The activation of innate immunity assessed by the activity of LE and α1-PI and adaptive immunity (levels of autoantibodies to neuroantigenes to S-100B and basic myelin protein) was identified.
Significant correlations of the level of immune system activation with the severity of patient's state on СGI-S (r=0.64, p=0.000001) as well as scores on the PANSS negative symptom subscale (r=0.34, p=0.0077) were found.
The results suggest the possibility of using these immunological parameters for the objectification of clinical state of children with schizophrenia.
