[Complex treatment of generalized gingivitis with mineral therapy].  A comprehensive examination and treatment of 49 students aged 20-25 years diagnosed chronic generalized catarrhal gingivitis (CGCG) were held.
Depending on the methods of treatment were created into two groups of observation.
The main group comprised 24 patients who along with dental sanitation and treatment of gingivitis took the course of salt treatment for 17 days, as opposed to control group.
Hygienic researches and mineralthcrapy were held in a special room (23.6 m2). equipped with sylvite blocks with a total reaction surface 5 m2, salt filters with air ducts filled with wooden plates with mineral fragments.
The study of the effectiveness of a comprehensive treatment of young patients with CGCG allowsto gel an information of the positive impact of salt therapyon the clinical condition of marginal periodontal tissues and indeces of oral cavity local immunity.
The main curative factorsforming the internal environment of silvinite structures are multicomponent highly dispersed salt aerosol with a defined particle size and aeroionization.  Natural salts complex consisting of chlorides of potassium, sodium and magnesium has an anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulating effects.
