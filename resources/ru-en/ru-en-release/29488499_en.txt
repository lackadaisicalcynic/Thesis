[The clinical and functional condition of the larynx in the patients of the elder age group presenting with chronic oedematous polypoidal laryngitis].  This article was designed to report the results of the evaluation of the clinical and functional condition of the larynx in the patients of the elder age group presenting with chronic oedematous polypoidal laryngitis before and after their surgical treatment.
A total of 60 patients at the age from 60 to 72 years were available for the examination; all of them had a concomitant somatic or ENT pathology.  The clinical and functional conditions of the larynx in the patients of the elder age group were studied, with special reference to those suffering from chronic oedematous polypoidal laryngitis before the surgical intervention, that determined the overall clinical picture of the disease characterized in the first place by the predominance of the severe polypoid process with the combination of the organic and functional laryngeal pathology.
The specific clinical and functional features of the larynx were identified after the surgical treatment that exerted the appreciable influence on the postoperative course of the disease and the duration of dysphonia.  The peculiarities of postoperative laryngitis are described.
Its catarrhal form was diagnosed in 42% of the patients.  The strong inflammatory reaction with exudation and formation of fibrin films was documented in 58% of the patients while 83% of them exhibited formation of the functional component of dysphonia that required the application of the additional therapeutic measures for the complete restoration of the vocal function taking into consideration the age-related alteration of the larynx together with the long-term postoperative observation of the patients.
