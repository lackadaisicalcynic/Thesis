[Comparative study of long term result of auto- and allografts for keratinized gingiva restoration in vestibuloplasty area on the lower jaw].
The purpose of the study was to assess the changes in the width and quality of keratinized tissue created in the area of vestibuloplasty on the lower jaw.  Preliminary results of the study showed that autotransplantation method allows creating proper buffer zone with the desired mucosa thickness and is particularly justified in cases of "washing board" effect.
However, the method is technically more demanding and is more expensive and painfull for patients.
The use of alternative materials of artificial origin, such as "Mucograft" and "Tachocomb" simplifies the execution of operation, thereby reducing operational risk, but often does not lead to the formation of a fully keratinized gingiva.
