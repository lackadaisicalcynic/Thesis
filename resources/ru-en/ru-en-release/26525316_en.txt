[The replacement of defects in the frontal walls of the paranasal sinuses by the allotransplants].  The aim of the present work were the development and clinical testing of the method for the closure of defects in the anterior wallsof the frontal and maxillary sinuses with the use of the allotransplants.
We have carried out the experimental studies with the transposition of the cartilaginous allograft into the bone defect by means of the press-fit technique.
Within six months after the operation, the transplantation resulted in the formation of a regenerate composed of the lamellar bone tissue.
We have also undertaken the clinical testing of the method forthe closure of defects in the anterior wallsof the frontal and maxillary sinuses using the cartilaginous allograft.
In all the cases, the favourable clinical outcome has been achieved as evidenced by the integrity of the restored anterior wall of the sinus.
