[The comparative analysis of the effectiveness of various forms of the surgical treatment of the patients presenting with chronic odontogenic maxillary sinusitis].  UNLABELLED
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of various forms of the surgical treatment of the patients presenting with chronic odontogenic maxillary sinusitis (COMS) with special reference to its long-term  RESULTS
The secondary objective was to assess the quality of life of such patients during the postoperative period.  The study included 107 patients divided into two groups.
The patients of group 1 (n=32) underwent radical operation on the maxillary sinuses (MS) as described by Caldwell and Luc.
The patients of group 2 (n=75) were treated with the use of endoscopic surgery on maxillary sinuses.  The results of the study suggest that endoscopic surgery on maxillary sinuses can be employed for the minimally invasive revision of the maxillary sinuses; it thereby ensures a smoother course of the postoperative period and improves the quality of life of the treated patients.
