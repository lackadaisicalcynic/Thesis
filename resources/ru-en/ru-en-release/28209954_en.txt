[Combined echinococcosis management in children].  AIM  To analyze the results of diagnosis and treatment of combined echinococcosis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 51 children.
40 (78.4%) of them had combined lesion of liver and other organs, 29 - combined echinococcosis of liver and lungs.
Echinococcosis of both lungs was observed in 14 children including lesion of liver in 6 cases.
Combined echinococcosis of three organs was observed in 5 patients.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Combined echinococcosis in children was associated with uneven growth of parasitic cysts in various tissues.  Small cysts were revealed in 15 (37.5%) out of 40 observations of combined lesion of liver and other organs.
7 patients underwent medical therapy for small cysts after previous surgery for medium and large cysts.
Rapid growth of remained cysts occurred within 1-3 months between surgical stages.  It may be often associated with complications related to remained cyst especially in case of both lungs echinococcosis.
There were 6 (11.8%) postoperative complications in 51 patients with combined echinococcosis.
Recurrence occurred in 2 (3.9%) children.
Deaths were absent.
CONCLUSION
Conservative therapy for small cysts provides 2-fold decrease of operations number and prevents recurrence of the disease.
Reduced period between surgical stages up to 11Â±2 days prevents complications in case of both lungs echinococcosis.
