[Anemia and dysregulation of iron metabolism in multiple sclerosis].  Anemia is one of the common diseases comorbid with multiple sclerosis (MS).
This article reviews the prevalence and types of anemia in MS patients.  It has been shown that anemia is often accompanied by a decrease in serum iron level.
The authors present the data on iron metabolism in patients with MS and MRI findings concerning deposits of iron in the gray matter of the brain.
The causal relationship between abnormalities in iron metabolism and MS remains unclear; this study allows to approach the understanding of the MS pathogenesis and to increase the efficacy of therapy for this disease.
