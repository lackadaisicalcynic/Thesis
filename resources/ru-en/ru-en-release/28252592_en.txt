[The application of the modern high-energy laser technologies for the surgical treatment of the patients presenting with otosclerosis].  The objective of the present study was to determine the optimal parameters of radiation of the CO2 laser during the surgical intervention for the treatment of the patients presenting with otosclerosis.
The experimental part of the study was carried out with the use of the isolated temporal bones.  Under the clinical conditions, the patients with the tympanic and mixed forms of otosclerosis underwent stapedoplasty with the use of the CO2 laser.
It was shown that the use of the CO2 laser at different stages of stapedoplasty considerably reduces the risk of development of the post-operative complications.
It is concluded that the proposed stapedoplastic technique makes it possible to decrease the duration of post-surgical rehabilitation of the patients suffering from otosclerosis.
