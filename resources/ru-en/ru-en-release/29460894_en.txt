[The clinical and morphological characteristics of C1q glomerulopathy].  C1q glomerulopathy is a rare variety of chronic glomerulonephritis manifested as C1q deposition revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy.
The pathogenesis and etiology of the disease have not been studied.
The paper deals with the results of clinical, morphological, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic examinations in 13 patients with C1q glomerulopathy.
Light microscopy more commonly revealed membranous nephropathy, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, and nephrosclerosis.
Immunofluorescence microscopy detected a C1q fraction in association with other deposits, more frequently IgM and IgG ones.  A correlation was found between the clinical presentation and morphological form of chronic glomerulonephritis.
