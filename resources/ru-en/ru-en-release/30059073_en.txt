[Role of intercellular slit-like contacts (connexins) in the pathogenesis of erythroderma].
Erythroderma is a skin lesion characterized by redness, swelling, infiltration, and desquamation of greater than 90% of the skin.  The etiology of erythroderma is not completely clear and the lesion can be manifestations of various chronic dermatoses, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, and toxicodermia, and be represented by erythrodermic mycosis fungoides.
The pathogenesis of erythroderma especially at the genetic level remains little studied.  Thus, one disease (erythroderma) can be a manifestation of different dermatoses and have similar clinical and histological signs.
This paper gives a review of modern literature on the study of erythroderma in terms of morphology and genetic aspects.
