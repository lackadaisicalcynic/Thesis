[The differential diagnosis of recurrent episodes of vertigo].  UNLABELLED
Recurrent episodes of vertigo are one of the most frequent reasons of referrals for medical help.
In the Russian medicine, the development of vertigo is traditionally associated with a cerebral vascular pathology.  It is suggested that correctly planned clinical neurovestibular study may identify the signs of a balance disorder of peripheral and central genesis.
OBJECTIVE
To increase the effectiveness of the differential diagnosis of peripheral and central vertigo in patients with recurrent episodes of balance disorders using the protocol of neurovestibular examination ALGORITM.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 120 outpatients with preliminary diagnoses of cerebral ischemia and autonomic vascular dystonia.
RESULTS
Signs of lesion of peripheral and central regions of the vestibular system were found in 43.5 and 17.5% patients, respectively.  Benign positional vertigo was the most frequent cause of vertigo while chronic cerebral ischemia was identified in 16.5% of the patients.
CONCLUSION  Neurovestibularexamnation using the protocol ALGORITM is important for assessment of the level of vestibular system lesion.
Iitis necessary to use it in complex examination of patients with complaints of vertigo.
