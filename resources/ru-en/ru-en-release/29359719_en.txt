[Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome: clinical/laboratory characteristics].
AIM
Based on the current conceptions on the genesis of hyperkinetic syndromes in children and adolescents, to single out a group of patients with suggestive PANS, compare clinical and laboratory results and determine clinical/laboratory characteristics of this syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty-nine patients with tics were studied using neurological examination, questionnaires and international scales for assessment of tics, obsessive-compulsive disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Laboratory tests included general blood tests, antistreptolysin O test, determination of rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, circulating immune complexes, nasopharyngeal wash for β-hemolytic streptococcus, antineuronal antibodies and immunoglobulins A, M, G, E, CD4, CD8-lymphocytes.  The same tests were performed in the control group.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Clinical symptoms were different by the severity and phenomenology of tic hyperkineses in patients with PANS compared to the patients with tics without immune disorders.
Most of the patients were diagnosed with Tourette syndrome.
ADHD was the most common diagnosis in the PANS group.  Its frequency was 2.5 higher in the male patients.
A chronic focus of infection did no predict the development of PANS.  Based on the laboratory results, one can assume that β-hemolytic streptococcus A infection, lower JgM levels and an elevated CD8+ lymphocytes predict the development of autoimmune mental and neurological disorders in the group of PANS patients.
