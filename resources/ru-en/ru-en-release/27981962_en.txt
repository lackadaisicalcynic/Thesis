[The identification of the AB0 blood type system by means of the single nucleotide polymorphisms analysis].
The authors describe a domestically produced test-system for the determination of the AB0 blood type by means of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis.  The results of the trials indicate that the proposed test-system can be employed for the investigation of DNA specimens of individual origin obtained from any objects of expertise including micro-objects containing human nuclear DNA.
