[Sanation of petrous bone cholesteatoma in the otosurgical practice].  The present article reports the clinical cases of the surgical intervention on 20 patients presenting with petrous bone cholesteatoma.
We have identified several clinical variants of petrous bone cholesteatoma based on the results of multispiral computed tomography (MSCT) of the temporal bones and categorized them into the following types in accordance with the classification proposed by Moffat-Smith an M. Sanna for this pathological condition: supralabyrinthine (n=8), supralabyrinthine-apical (n=2), infralabyrinthine (n=3), infralabyrinthine-apical (n=5), massive (n=1), and massive - apical (n=1).
The surgical sanation of petrous bone cholesteatoma was performed in all the 20 patients in the absence of the pronounced bone destruction in the walls of the temporal bone pyramid and of the subdural expansion of cholesteatoma.
In all the cases, the trepanation cavity remained open till its complete epidermization.
The follow up period was around 3 years in duration on the average.
The post-surgical analysis of the clinical conditions of each of the 20 patients was performed with special reference to the surgical technique applied for the removal of petrous bone cholesteatoma and the final outcome of the radical treatment.
