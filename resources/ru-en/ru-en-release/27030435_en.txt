[Technique for surgical repositioning of in-the-bag dislocated intraocular lenses].  AIM
to develop and test a new technique for surgical repositioning of in-the-bag dislocated intraocular lenses (IOLs).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Surgical outcomes of 21 patients with in-the-bag IOL dislocation were analyzed (follow-up period 1-12 years).
RESULTS
The proposed method of IOL-capsular bag complex fixation with two double sutures provides a reliable anatomic and functional result.
CONCLUSION
The new technique enables surgical repositioning of in-the-bag dislocated IOLs following trauma in patients who have not had an intracapsular ring implanted before.
