[Clinical and neurophysiological heterogeneity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder].
AIM  To determine clinical/neurophysiological characteristics of different forms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the efficacy of treatment with cerebrolysin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty children, aged 9 to 12 years, with ADHD were examined using clinical and electroencephalographic methods.
Idiopathic and residual-organic forms were compared.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The study shows significantly higher levels of impulsivity and hyperactivity in children with residual-organic form of the disease.  There were significant differences in the amplitude component of engaging in action (P3 Go) and the amplitude of the action suppression component (P3 NOGO) in patients with different forms of ADHD.
The high clinical efficacy (improvement in 70.0% of patients with idiopathic form of ADHD and 86.7% of patients with residual-organic form of the disease) was found.
