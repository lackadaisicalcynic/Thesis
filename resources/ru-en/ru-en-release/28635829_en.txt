[Ocular tuberculosis].
Ocular tuberculosis (OTB) is a specific infectious (bacterial) disease dealt with by ophthalmologists and phthisiatricians.  This is a serious illness with chronic, persistent course and extremely doubtful prognosis.
Chemotherapy, even if effective, can still be followed by a decrease in visual acuity.  Clinical recovery is often unstable.
Ocular tuberculosis is largely associated with permanent disability and, as a result, a decline in quality of life of these patients.  Statistical reporting does not always reflect the true prevalence of the disease as it sometimes develops in patients with pre-existing specific pulmonary involvement.
This article discusses all pathogenetic mechanisms of OTB that have been described so far.
Attention is paid to modern diagnostic methods, including spectral optical coherence tomography.
Positive results of endonasal electrophoresis for the treatment of OTB are described.
