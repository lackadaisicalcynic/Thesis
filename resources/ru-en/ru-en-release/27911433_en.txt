[Medical terminology.
Blepharorhaphy].  Ophthalmic literature currently lacks definiteness in classifying surgeries aimed at eyelid closure.
In Western countries the term tarsorrhaphy is most commonly used, while in Russia another term - blepharorhaphy - is widely accepted.  The latter seems more appropriate as the sutures are passed through all palpebral layers, not just the cartilage.
It has also been suggested that temporary blepharorhaphy, which implies that we use only sutures to bring the eyelids together, and therefore, the procedure cannot be permanent, should be called simple blepharorhaphy.
As to a procedure (temporary or permanent), of which the goal is ankyloblepharon, it is recommended to be called ankylosing blepharorhaphy, instead of permanent.  CONCLUSION
Blepharorhaphy is a more appropriate name for eyelid closure surgery than tarsorrhaphy.
Blepharorhaphy can be simple or ankylosing and only the latter can be either temporary or permanent.
The authors suggest reconsidering classification of this type of surgical procedures.
