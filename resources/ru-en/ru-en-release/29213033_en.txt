[Epigenetic modifications of chromatin in epilepsy: a potential mechanism of pharmacoresistance?]  Pharmacoresistance in epilepsy is an important problem from both clinical and fundamental perspectives.
The existent hypotheses of pharmacoresistance are based on long term plastic rebuilding of the epileptic brain.
One of potential mechanisms mediating such protracted changes are alterations of gene expression induced by epigenetic modifications of chromatin in brain cells of epileptic patients.
Recently, changes in DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications were reported in brain tissues of patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy.  Unfortunately, these data remain fragmentary and contradictory, therefore the results of animal models can partially fill this gap.
The authors present a short review of the data concerning a potential role of epigenetic modifications in epilepsy.
