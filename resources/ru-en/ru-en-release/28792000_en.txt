[Lower extremity varicose veins in childhood and at a young age: Mechanism of development and specific features].  In Russia more than 125,000 patients with various venous diseases, lower extremity varicose veins (LEVV) being predominant, were annually operated on.
In recent years, there has been a trend toward younger patients with signs of LEVV.  Screening studies have revealed the signs of the disease in 10-15% of high-school children.
The high prevalence of LEVV as a whole and its younger onset in recent decades cause more attention to an investigation of the relationship between the development of varicose veins, in childhood and adolescence in particular, and genomic changes.
Patients with varicose veins have been noted to have a genetically reduced capacity for contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the vein walls, their remodeling due to the increased synthesis of matrix Gla protein, overproduction of TGF-Î²1, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, hyperhomocysteinemia, and mutations in the genes encoding the synthesis of thrombomodulin.
Varicose vein transformation is considered to be a minor phenomenon of undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia (UCTD) leading to failure of their walls due to abnormalities in the fibrous structures and extracellular matrix.
Confirmation of the role of UCTD in the development of varicose veins will be able to provide an individual approach to treating patients and to choosing adequate postoperative therapy aimed at preventing a disease recurrence.
