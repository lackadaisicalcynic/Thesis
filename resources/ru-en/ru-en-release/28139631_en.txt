[Adaptogenic and neuroprotective effects of lithium ascorbate].
OBJECTIVE  Investigation of the neuroprotective properties of lithium ascorbate on the stress models in vivo and in vitro.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Neurocytological and behavioral studies on nerve cell culture and animal stress models.
RESULTS
Significant neuroprotective effect of lithium ascorbate in neuronal cultures exposed to glutamate toxicity and adaptogenic effect of this drug in stress model in rats were shown.
CONCLUSION
The results suggest lithium ascorbate has a high neuroprotective potential in stress models in vivo and in vitro.
