[Ophthalmic manifestations of facial nerve palsy].  Facial nerve palsy is a common pathology that develops due to various diseases, traumas and medical interventions.
The most common peripheral type of facial paralysis leads to acute unilateral involvement of facial muscles along with the development of paralytic lagophthalmos.
The absence of adequate and timely medical treatment in patients with paralytic lagophthalmos can lead to severe corneal complications such as cornea perforation causing loss of eye and consequently restricted professional ability, work capacity and significant decrease of patient's life quality.
Patients with paralytic lagophthalmos require timely, complex, planned treatment involving various correction methods aimed at protection of the cornea, as well as anatomical and functional recovery of the eyelids.  Chemodenervation of the upper eyelid muscles is a pathogenetically substantiated method that can help restore the protective function of the upper eyelid and prevent corneal complications; it can be recommended for early stages of the disease.
