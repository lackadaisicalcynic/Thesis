[Combined YAG-laser capsulotomy in pseudophakic patients with anterior capsular contraction syndrome].
Progressive metaplastic fibrosis of the anterior capsulorhexis opening is a frequent complication of the postoperative period.
There is a widely practiced method of anterior capsular contraction syndrome (ACCS) correction through radial anterior laser capsulotomy.
Despite many advantages, it can be complicated by unpredictable anterior capsule tearing and intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation into the vitreous Body, which justifies the search for new technical solutions.  AIM
to develop a safe technique of combined laser anterior capsulotomy (LAC) in patients with ACCS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included 19 patients (20 eyes) with ACCS.
The suggested LAC technique involved two differently directed YAG-laser cuts that could be regarded as a combination of radial anterior capsulotomy and anterior peripheral linear capsulotomy.  With the cuts located perpendicularly to each other, the distal end of each radial cut was connected to the middle of each longitudinal cut.
RESULTS  The suggested technique allows an increase in the anterior capsulorhexis diameter up to more than twice the pre-laser size.
The difference between the average pre- and post-laser capsulorhexis diameters was statistically significant (Ñ€<0.0001).
Neither case developed an unpredictable anterior capsule tear.
CONCLUSION  The safety of the new technique is ensured by preliminary longitudinal cuts that create a barrier against unpredictable radial tears in the capsular bag during radial capsulotomy.
