[Dosed walking efficacy in the complex correction of cognitive impairment in elderly patients].  The dosed walking efficacy with including the cognitive training as the component of complex therapy of mild and moderate dementia was examined in elderly patients with the probable Alzheimer's disease and mixed dementia.
It was stated that dosed walking with cognitive training interventions improved cognitive performance in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease to a greater extent as compared to a single medical therapy and patients with mixed dementia probably due to severe structural changes of the brain.  Female patients showed more advantageous health outcome.
