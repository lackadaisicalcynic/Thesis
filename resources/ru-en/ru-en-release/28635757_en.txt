[A role of the gastrointestinal tract microbiota in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease].
Microbiota is a community of microorganisms, viruses, protozoa, colonizing the gut.  There are tight phylogenetic relationships between the gut microbiota and the human body, the disturbance of which may lead to the CNS dysfunction as well as to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.
This review focuses on general and specific aspects of the influence of gut microbiota on the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).
Current theories and models of the relationship between microbiota and brain structures in PD are presented with a specific focus on neurochemical and immunological aspects of the problem.
