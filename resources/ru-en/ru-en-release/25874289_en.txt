[Scoliotic spine deformity in children and adolescents associated with the craniovertebral junction pathology].
This literature review is devoted to the clinical and pathogenic aspects of the relationship between Chiari type I malformation (CMT) and scoliosis.  The view of the clinical presentation development in CMT associated with scoliosis is considered on the basis of both the CSF dynamics disturbances and vascular pathology of the craniovertebral junction.
The role of the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane is evaluated.
Case reports of the risk factors for scoliosis progression in patients with CMT are presented.
