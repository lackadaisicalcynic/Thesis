[Botulinum toxin in treatment of lower limb spasticity in patients with brain damage].
AIM  To develop and test a method of examination of patients with lower limb spasticity, to describe lower limb spasticity patterns in patients with brain damage and to assess the efficacy of abobotulinumtoxin A (dysport) in the rehabilitation of patients with stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Spasticity rating scales (MAS and Tardieu), the Barthel index, the Rankin scale , the Rivermead Mobility Index, the Hauser Ambulation Index, a comfortable walking test were used.
Treatment satisfaction was assessed with the Visual analogue scale.  Abobotulinumtoxin A (dysport) was used for treatment of lower limb spasticity.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Two most common patterns (dynamic and static) were identified in patients with post-stroke spasticity and the method of testing spasticity was developed.
The prevalence of spasticity in individual muscles of the lower extremity was estimated as well.  An analysis of the efficacy of dysport and a sensitive analysis of the scales used in the study were carried out.
