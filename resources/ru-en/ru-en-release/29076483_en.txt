[Prognostic criteria of efficacy of programmed laparoscopic sanitation of the abdominal cavity in peritonitis].  AIM
To define prognostic criteria of efficacy of programmed laparoscopic sanitation of the abdominal cavity in peritonitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  There were 32 patients after programmed laparoscopic sanitation of abdominal cavity for peritonitis due to different acute surgical diseases.
Subsequently 12 of them required relaparotomy due to poor effectiveness of laparoscopic sanitation.  Comprehensive clinical examination and laboratory assessment of some indexes of homeostasis and oxidative status were conducted.
RESULTS  Prognostic clinical and laboratory criteria of efficacy of laparoscopic abdominal sanitation were suggested after analysis of intraoperative data during primary surgery and laboratory values in the 1st postoperative day.
CONCLUSION
The offered prognostic criteria allow to define further management of peritonitis patients after primary laparotomy.
