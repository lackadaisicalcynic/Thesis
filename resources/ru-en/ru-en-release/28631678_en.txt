The patients were divided into two groups, one comprised of 286 (86.5%) patients who underwent the newly developed rehabilitative treatment and the group of comparison composed of 88 (23.5%) patients who received a different treatment during the postoperative period.  The analysis has demonstrated the significant reduction in the velocity of the surface acoustic waves in the skin of the external nose of the patients of the main study group within 1 and 6 months after the surgical intervention.
The change was especially well apparent at the sites with the relatively thicker skin underlain by the subcutaneous adipose tissue.  This result can be regarded as giving evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed physiotherapeutic treatment that allowed to achieve the rapid decrease of postoperative oedema and prevent the subsequent excessive cicatrization.
