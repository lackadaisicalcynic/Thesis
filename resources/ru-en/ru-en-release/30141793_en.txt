[Epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders in children].  The problem of epilepsy comorbidity with autism spectrum disorders in children is discussed.
The incidence data of autism spectrum disorders in epilepsy, epileptiform discharges on the EEG in autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy in autism spectrum disorders are reviewed.
The following types of epilepsy and autism co-occurrence are discussed: both conditions are independent, have different causes and may co-occur by chance; epilepsy and autism are associated, both being independent consequences of the same genetic disorder or early cerebral damage; autism is caused by the epileptic process which interferes with the function of specific brain networks involved in the development of communication and social behavior; autism is a result of the withdrawal reaction in the epileptic child.
The known genetic causes of epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders comorbidity are provided.
The practical issues are discussed, in particular the rational indication of antiepileptic drugs to the children suffering autism spectrum disorders.
