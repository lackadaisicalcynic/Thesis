Clinical-microbiological research of action ozone therapy and light-emetting diode radiation of red range (630 nanometers) on microflora of the hole extracted toothatalveolitis and limited osteomyelitis of jaws.  As a result of cliniko-microbiological research the data testifying to substantial improvement of efficiency of antimicrobictherape at inclusion in a complex of medical actions at alveolitis and the limited osteomyelitis of a jow ozone therapy in a combination with a light-emettinf diode irradiation of the hole extracted teeth red ( 630 nanometers) are obtained by light.
