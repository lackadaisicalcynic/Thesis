AIM  To define the risk factors of complications which are followed by re-operations in patients with cardiac and pericardial wounds and to prevent these complications.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Retrospective and prospective analysis of 1072 victims with cardiac and pericardial injuries for 35 years was performed.
Overall mortality was 17.2%.
98 patients died during surgery.
Postoperative bleeding was observed in 38 (3.9%) cases.
RESULTS
In 28 cases re-operations were performed for bleeding-related complications.
Indications for re-thoracotomy were one-time drainage from pleural cavity over 500 ml or bleeding rate over 100 ml per hour for 4 hours.
Prevention of postoperative bleeding in case of cardiac and pericardial wounds was developed on basis of analysis of these observations.
CONCLUSION
Risk factors of complications requiring re-operation are cardiomyopathy of different etiology, technical and tactical errors during primary intervention and hypocoagulation with massive blood loss.
Prevention of these complications includes careful heart wound closure, comprehensive intraoperative control, correction of hemostatic system.
