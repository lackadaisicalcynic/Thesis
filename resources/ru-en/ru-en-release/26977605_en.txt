AIM  To analyze the results of laparo- and thoracoscopy in patients with thoracic and abdominal trauma in conditions of emergency hospital.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period 2006-2013 we performed 56 laparoscopic and 15 thoracoscopic interventions in 67 patients with trauma.  There were 80.6% of men and 19.4% of women aged 35Â±1.7 years.
Abdominal, thoracic and thoraco-abdominal injuries were observed in 51 (76.1%), 14 (20.9%) and 2 (3%) patients.
Abdominal or thoracic trauma alone was diagnosed in 41 (61.2%) cases and combined injury - in 26 (38.8%) patients.
37 (66%) interventions were performed laparoscopically.  Conversion to laparotomy was observed in 19 (34%) cases.
Mean volume of hemoperitoneum was 458 ml (range 100-1100 ml).
In 11 (73.3%) patients thoracoscopic surgery was performed and conversion of access was applied in 4 (26.7%) cases.
RESULTS
No injuries of internal organs were observed in 19.6% and 13.3% of patients using laparo- and thoracoscopy respectively.  So inadvisable open surgery was prevented although formal indications for laparo- and thoracotomy were present.
In 25% and 20% of abdominal and thoracic damages respectively we avoided relatively unjustified laparo- or thoracotomy because of injuries were cured endoscopically.
No one missed injury was observed.
Postoperative complications were diagnosed in 5.6% of cases.
Mortality rate was 15.6% in case of severe combined trauma.
Mean hospital stay was 23.2 days (range 3-105).
CONCLUSION
Endoscopic techniques are perspective in treatment of thoracic and abdominal trauma.
It allows to avoid inadvisable laparo- and thoracotomy in some cases and to improve results of treatment.
