[Ultrastructural changes of lymphocytes in patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine].
OBJECTIVE
to study the effect of olanzapine on the ultrastructure of different populations of lymphocytes and lymphoblasts in patients with schizophrenia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors performed a morphometric study using electron microscopy of lymphocytes in 56 patients with schizophrenia treated for 8 weeks with olanzapine and 49 patients treated for 28 weeks with olanzapine before and after treatment.  Authors estimated the frequency and ultrastructural parameters of small, large, large activated lymphocytes and lymphoblasts.
RESULTS
The frequency of small lymphocytes in patients treated with olanzapine increased and that of large lymphocytes decreased in treated patients as compared to the patients before treatment.
The volume fraction of lysosomes increased significantly in small, large and large activated lymphocytes after treatment as compared to the patients before treatment.
CONCLUSION
The increased lysosome content in different lymphocyte subpopulations might contribute to the mechanism of olanzapine efficacy.
