[Dissociation of structural and functional parameters of the retina and optic nerve in a patient with Alzheimer's disease (clinical case)].
Visual impairment is often one of the earliest sings of Alzheimer's disease.
This article reports a clinical case of a female patient diagnosed with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.  As revealed by a comprehensive examination, her visual fields and visual evoked potentials were markedly changed, while morphometric parameters of the retina and optic nerve appeared normal.
Such a significant dissociation of structural and functional parameters may indicate a more proximal involvement of visual pathways in Alzheimer's disease.
