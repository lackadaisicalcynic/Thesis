[Adhesion molecule JAM-A, its function and mechanism of epigenetic regulation].
The article represents evidence about structures, properties and functions of adhesion molecule JAM-A/1 belonging to JAM subfamily.
This protein plays an important role in epithelial tight junction formation and immune function.  Current article focuses on the role of JAM-A protein in pathogenesis associated to ageing: atherosclerosis, apoplexy, thrombosis, hypertension, ophthalmological pathology.
We propose short peptides Lys-Glu, Lys-Glu-Asp, and Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly could influence on F11R gene expression that leads to recovery of JAM-A synthesis in cells.
