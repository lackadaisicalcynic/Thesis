[The possibility of using combination therapy in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia].  AIM
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of mexiB 6 and vinpotropil 10/800 in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 30 outpatients with chronic cerebral ischemia, 1-2 stages.  The average age was 55,2±10,04 years.
All patients underwent clinical/neurological examination.
To assess the efficacy of therapy, the Visual-Analog Scale, the Test of feeling, activity and mood, the Montreal Cognitive Evaluation Scale, the Asthenia Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used.
All patients were treated with mexicB 6 (1 tablet 3 times a day for 1 month), then vinpotropil 10/800 (1 tablet 3 times a day) was used in addition to mexiB 6.
The total duration of follow-up was 2 months.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Treatment with mexiB 6 led to a significant regression of patients' complaints starting from the second week of therapy, the improvement in well-being was noted in all patients.
Inclusion of vinpotropil in the therapy resulted in the additional symptom regression in 19 (63,3%) patients.
At the end of combined therapy, there was a significant improvement on all the scales that indicated improvements in cognitive functions, asthenic and anxiety-depressive disorders.
An increase in Mg in the blood (0,91±0,05 mmol/l), which did not change after 2 months of therapy (0,94±0,05 mmol/l) was observed.
Undesirable phenomena during treatment were not recorded.
MexiB 6 and vinpotropil were well-tolerated in both monotherapy and combined use.
The proposed therapy scheme is effective and safe.
