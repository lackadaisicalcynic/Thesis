[Dental 3d level simulators in the study of local anesthesia].  The purpose of the study was to develop a training protocol for local anesthesia in dental students.
The study involved 90 2d year dental school students divided into 3 groups according to procedure training method: on skeletal preparations; by «Typodont» simulator and by combination of methods.
Manipulation effectiveness criteria in skeletal preparations was penetrating the mandibular foramina by isolation of the corresponding region by latex scarf.  In «Typodont» the effective injection was determined by light and sound signals.
The results showed the necessity for combined approach as it gives an opportunity to identify mandible foramina by projecting on soft tissue marks with further skills developing on the simulator.
When using the combined approach only 4 students successfully completed their task by initial injection while at the second attempt only 4 were not successful.
