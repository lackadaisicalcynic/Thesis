[A complex sanatorium-resort rehabilitation of patients with cerebral palsy with spastic diplegia].
AIM  To study an influence of combined methods of rehabilitation for recovery of motor functions in patients with cerebral palsy with spastic diplegia (CPSD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Seventy-six patients with CPSD, aged from 14 to 19 years (mean age 18.7Â±4.63 years), were under observation.
A comprehensive clinical and instrumental examination was conducted.
Patients of the main group received a course of underwater spinal traction with the introduction of the drug cellex along with Spa treatment.
Patients of the comparison group received only Spa treatment.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Signs of involvement of segmental structures of the nervous system in the pathological process and their role in the formation of motion pathology are established.
It is shown that the inclusion of underwater traction according to the original technique and simultaneous introduction of cellex in the complex of rehabilitation measures allows to achieve a pronounced positive dynamics in the form of expansion of motor capabilities of patients with cerebral palsy.
There was a significant decrease in spastic muscle tone, restoration of the volume of movements in the joints, improved walking.
Positive clinical dynamics was correlated with EMG data.
