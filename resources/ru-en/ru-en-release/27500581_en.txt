[The systemic approach to the rehabilitation of the patients presenting with laryngeal cancer after the resection of the organ and laryngectomy with tracheoesophageal by-pass and endoprosthetics].  The objective of the present study was to enhance the effectiveness of rehabilitation of the patients presenting with laryngeal cancer after the resection of the organ and laryngotomy with tracheoesophageal by-pass and endoprosthetics.
Our experience in this field is based on the treatment of 102 patients.  They were distributed by the nosological forms as follows: primary laryngeal cancer in 97 patients including T1NoMo - 8 (8.2%), T2NoMo - 63 (65%), T3NoMo - 18 (17.6%), T2N1Mo - 1 (0.9%), T4NoMo - 3 (2.9%), and T4N1M0 - 4 (3.9%), root of the tongue cancer spreading over the vestibular part of the larynx in one patient, laryngeal sarcoma in one patient, relapse of cancer following the full-dose radiotherapy and organ-sparing surgery in 3 patients.
Laryngeal resection was performed in 83 patients; 19 patients underwent laryngectomy with tracheoesophageal by-pass and endoprosthetics using a domestically manufactured voice prosthesis.
The systemic approach to the rehabilitation of the patients and the use of the proposed treatment algorithm made it possible to restore the function of the larynx by means of organ-sparing surgery in 79 (95.1%) of the 83 patients.
The vocal function in the patients following laryngectomy with tracheoesophageal by-pass and endoprosthetics was restored in 18 (94.7%) of the 19 patients.
