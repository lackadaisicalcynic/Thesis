[Hakim-Adams syndrome].  Hakim-Adams syndrome is little known, although quite common disease.
The etiology is not fully clear.
Pathogenetic mechanisms included the blockage of cerebrospinal fluid outflow along the upper lateral surface of the brain, development of hydrocephalus with the expansion of the brain ventricles while maintaining normotensive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Main manifestations are ataxia, apraxia, symptoms of dementia and urinary disturbances, up to incontinence.  Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, exploratory lumbar and neuroimaging.
Main treatment is ventriculoperitoneal (stomach) shunt placement for fluid drainage.  Timely surgical intervention gives good results and improves quality of life of patients.
