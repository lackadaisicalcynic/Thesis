[Increased oral fluid remineraling function by endogenous and exogenous saturation methods of its mineral complexes].  RELEVANCE
One of the most common problems in modern caries prevention is the development of techniques to increase tooth resistance to the effects of cariogenic factors.
Therefore, research is needed to study the chemical composition of tissues like teeth and body fluids surrounding the tooth to prevent demineralization process.  The purpose of determining the effectiveness of work- and correlation relationship between endo saturation exogenous methods oral liquid mineral complexes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In 95 patients analyzed the chemical composition and structure of the oral fluid by IR spectroscopy.
For the collection of IR spectra used Verteh-70 spectrometer ('Bruker', Germany) and the prefix of frustrated total internal reflection PLATINUM ATR diamond prism.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A correlation between the use of endogenous and exogenous methods of caries prevention, in favor of the former, as well as changes in the mineral-organic and phosphate-carbon ratio in the dry residues of oral fluid.
