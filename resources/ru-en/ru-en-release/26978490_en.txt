[Alarming signs and symptoms in the early diagnostics of late onset Pompe disease: super omnia clinica].
Pompe disease (PD) is a rare autosomal recessive muscle lysosomal glycogenosis caused by a deficiency of acid-α-glucosidase.  There are two main forms of the disease: aggressive infantile PD started within the first year of life with a severe enzyme deficiency and multiorgan involvement, and late onset PD (LOPD) with progressive signs and symptoms including predominant proximal, axial muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency started at any time from 1 till 75 years and older.
Usually due to physician's unawareness, most adults with PD are diagnosed with great delay.  The typical features and early nonspecific signs in four patients, aged between 35 and 72 years, with confirmed LOPD are delineated and discussed in correspondence with the age of first signs, age development of muscle weakness, distribution and age of final diagnosis.
The disorders for differential diagnosis and spectrum of conditions that expanded the possibility of PB are listed.
The fluorometrically analyzed level of acid α-glucosidase from dried blood spots is considered to be the first choice diagnostic method for clinically suspected cases of LOPD.
