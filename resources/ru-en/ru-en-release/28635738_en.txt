[Embryological aspects of clinical presentations of congenital lens and vitreous anomalies].
This report gives a general overview of embryological features of the human eye.  Key literature sources published during the last century on evaluation of congenital changes in the vitreous body and identification of signs of its 'underdevelopment' in certain types of congenital cataracts have been studied.
The said changes were analyzed in terms of general pathology of the human body as well as local morphological manifestations.  According to the authors, such an approach justifies the need for comparison of clinical manifestations of congenital lens and vitreous changes with possible embryonic defects.
