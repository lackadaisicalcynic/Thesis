[The use of cytoflavin in reperfusion in ischemic stroke].  OBJECTIVE
to study the efficacy of cytoflavin in thrombolytic treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke (IS).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-five patients in the acute stage of IS were examined.  The National Institutes of Health Stroke scale (NIHSS), the Rankin scale and the Barthel index of activities of daily living were used.
Depending on the scheme of treatment, patients were divided into 2 groups: the first (basic) group included 29 patients who received cytoflavin immediately after thrombolytic therapy.  The control group (26 patients) received basic vascular and neuroprotective treatment.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The marked reduction in the severity of neurological symptoms to the 10th day of treatment and higher probability of a successful outcome were noted in the basic group compared to the controls.
There was an improvement of functional activities according to the Rankin scale and of activities of daily living assessed by the Barthel index, with scores "moderate dependence" in the basic group and "severe dependence" in the control group.
The inclusion of cytoflavin in the treatment scheme of patients with acute IS increased the efficacy of treatment.
