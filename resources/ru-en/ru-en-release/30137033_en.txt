[Principles of surgical treatment for patients with asymptomatic aneurysms and cerebral aneurysms in the cold period after spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages].  Surgical treatment of patients with cerebral aneurysms still remains one of the most important issues of cerebrovascular neurosurgery, which is associated with both complexity of treatment and risks posed by the disease.
The purpose of this publication is to discuss the recommendations and algorithms adopted at the Neurosurgical Institute for choosing surgical treatment of patients with single and multiple intracranial aneurysms based on the clinical course of disease and anatomical morphological classifications of aneurysms.  The study was based on a large clinical material: we analyzed treatment outcomes in 1,621 patients (2009-2017); of these, 966 (59.5%) patients were operated on using microsurgical techniques, and 655 (40.4%) patients underwent endovascular surgery.
Surgical treatment of patients with cerebral aneurysms has been performed in close cooperation between two vascular (microsurgical and endovasal) departments, using the latest technical innovations.
