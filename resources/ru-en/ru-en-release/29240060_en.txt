[Conservative treatment of chronic diseases of lower limb veins: major risks of poor patient compliance].  Presented herein are the results of the Russian part of the International Research Programme 'VEIN ACT' aimed at studying approaches to conservative treatment of chronic vein diseases in the Russian Federation, assessing its efficacy and safety, as well as monitoring the patient compliance.
Also discussed are the regimen and results of conservative therapy, depending on patients' gender, age and body mass index, as well as the level of adherence to various methods of treatment in the cohorts concerned.
High efficacy of conservative therapy in all patients was confirmed.
However, the regimen of drug therapy needs to be adjusted depending on the disease severity, especially in patients of a more advanced age and those with obesity.
The lowest patient compliance was observed in relation to compression treatment.
The existing situation may be improved by be means of appropriate recommendations and a possible decrease of the level and degree of compression.
This should of course be done carefully and attentively, with obligatorily taking into consideration the patients' age and body mass index.
