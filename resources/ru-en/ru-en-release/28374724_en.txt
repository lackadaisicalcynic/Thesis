[The planning and evaluation of the effectiveness of rehabilitation of the patients presenting with osteoarthritis: application of the core set of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health].  This article was designed to report the results of analysis of the comprehensive rehabilitation programs for the patients presenting with osteoarthritis.
The analysis was based on the Core Set of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF Core Set).  The authors carried out the evaluation of the effectiveness of rehabilitation for two groups of the patients suffering from osteoarthritis who had previously undergone the combined treatment based at different healthcare facilities (an in-patient clinic, a spa and health resort).
It was shown that the application of the ICF Core Set for the management of osteoarthritis may be helpful for the development of a comprehensive rehabilitation program, the distribution of various tasks between the professionals in the most optimal way, and the correct evaluation of the effectiveness of their accomplishment.
The rehabilitation program elaborated based on the ICF Core Set made it possible to enhance the effectiveness of the cycle of the rehabilitation measures.
