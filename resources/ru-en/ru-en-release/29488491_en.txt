[The peculiar features of vestibular function disorders associated with Meniere's disease].  AIM
The objective of the present study was to reveal the special aspects of vestibular dysfunction in the patients presenting with unilateral Meniere's disease (MD) during the attack-free intervals.
METHODS  The study included 23 patients suffering from unilateral MD; all of them were examined with the use of tonal threshold audiometry, videonystagmography, the caloric test and video head-impulse test (vHIT).
RESULTS  The study has demonstrated that the patients with MD are characterized, during the attack-free intervals, by the absence of latent spontaneous nystagmus in conjunction with the positive results of the head shaking test.
Moreover, asymmetry of the results of the caloric test together with the normal results of the video head-impulse test is shown to be the characteristic feature of the patients with unilateral MD.
The analysis of the degree of sensorineural hearing loss, the caloric test data, and coefficient of labyrinth asymmetry (CLAS) gave evidence of the tendency toward the elevation of the hearing threshold with increasing CLAS.
