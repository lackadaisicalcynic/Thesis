[The relationship of lifespan with characteristics of life cycle and stress resistance in 12 species of Drosophila].  In the present study, we investigated the relationship of lifespan with different characteristics of the life history (length of the developmental period, imago body weight, fecundity) and stress resistance (response to oxidative stress, hyperthermia, starvation, and ionizing radiation) in flies of 12 species of the Drosophila genus.
It was shown, that D. virilis has the highest maximum lifespan, but the lifespan of D. kikkawai was lowest.  The investigated features have a positive (length of the developmental period, imago body weight, stress resistance) or negative (fecundity) correlation with species lifespan.
Apparently, the observed differences are caused by adaptations of the species to different environmental conditions of their natural habitat, and lifespan is a key indicator of integrative fitness, reflecting the viability and various characteristics of life history and stress resistance.
