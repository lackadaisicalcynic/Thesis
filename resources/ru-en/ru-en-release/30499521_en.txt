[Compensating the Descemet's membrane defect (a clinical case study)].  The article describes a clinical case of Descemet's membrane detachment that occurred during cataract phacoemulsification with implantation of intraocular lens.
Significant corneal edema developed in the early post-op period.
Considering the ability of endothelium to close its own defects even with large injury area, the patient was followed-up for 2 years.  Corneal edema was treated during 4 months and concluded with instillations of osmotic and anti-inflammatory drugs.
At 1.5-2 months of therapy, the edema was gradually decreasing, and by the 4th month of the follow-up the cornea was practically transparent.
Density of endothelial cells in central cornea, where the Descemet's membrane was absent, comprised 1000 cells/mm2.  Further observation revealed cornea staying transparent for 2 years after the surgery.
Complete optical recovery of patients with Descemet's membrane defect in this case study is supported by similar clinical cases briefly described in the article, and evidence that structural functional recovery of the corneal endothelial layer is possible even when it has large defects (more than 2.5 mm in diameter).
