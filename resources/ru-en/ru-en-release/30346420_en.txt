[Possibilities of resonant near-field ultra-high-frequency tomography in the diagnosis of oral mucosa conditions during gingival recessions surgery].
The clinical study involved 150 people who were divided into 5 main groups.  Patients were examined using resonance near-field ultra-high-frequency sounding, which makes it possible to record the electrodynamic state of the oral mucosa.
The obtained data made it possible to define the concept of the 'norm' of the dielectric characteristics of the oral mucosa of different localization, and also made it possible to conduct a survey of patients with gum recessions, assess the microcirculatory bed and the likelihood of developing ischemic disorders during the treatment stages.
