[The problems associated with the treatment of stenosing laryngotracheitis in the children (the results of the 35 year-long experience)].  Stenosing laryngotracheitis (SLT) affecting the children is considered to be an emergency pediatric condition associated with ENT pathology.
Its treatment presents a serious challenge for otolaryngologists, pediatricians, specialists in communicable diseases, allergologists, etc. We have undertaken a retrospective analysis of the available data with a view to summarizing the tendencies in the evolution of SLT morbidity.  The results of the 35 year-long experience with the use of the currently available therapeutic strategies for the treatment of the children suffering from stenosing laryngotracheitis are presented.
Special emphasis is laid on the advantages of the combined treatment of the patients presenting with this condition based at a specialized infectious department with the participation of an otorhinolaryngologist.
