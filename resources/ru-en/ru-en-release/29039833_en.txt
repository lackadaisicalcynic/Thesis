[Genetic determinants of hypertension in two national cohorts of Mountain Shoria].  AIM
To estimate the prevalence of the genotypes of the candidate genes ACE (I/D, rs4646994), ADRB1 (Ser49Gly, A/G, rs1801252) ADRA2B (I/D), MTHFR (C677T, Ala222Val, rs1801133), and eNOS (4b/4a) and their association with hypertension in two ethnic groups of Mountain Shoria.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A clinical and epidemiological study was conducted in a population compactly living in the hard-to-reach areas of Mountain Shoria (the settlements of Orton, Ust-Kabyrza, and Sheregesh of the Kemerovo Region).
A continuous method was used to survey 1178 residents from the above settlements; the sample consisted of adults (aged 18 years and older), 565 people were genotyped.
RESULTS
The prevalence of hypertension among the population of Mountain Shoria was 42.3%.
The incidence of this disease among the Shorians was lower (39.9%) than that among the representatives of non-indigenous people (46.1%).
The ethnically justified peculiarities of the association of ADRA2B and ACE I/D polymorphisms with hypertension were established.
There were fewer patients with hypertension among ACE ID and ADRA2B DD genotype carriers in the cohort of the Shorians than in that of the non-indigenous population: 40.6% versus 58.6% and 38.3% versus 64%, respectively.
Conversely, there were more hypertensive patients among the carriers of the homozygous ACE DD genotype in the native ethnic group (60%) than in the non-indigenous one (37.1%).
CONCLUSION
Adverse prognostic ACE DD, ADRB1 AA, MTHFR TT, and eNOS 4a/4a genotypes were more frequently observed in the non-indigenous ethnic groups; the ADRA2B DD genotype was more common in the native population.
Hypertension was associated with the ACE DD, ÐœTHFR CT, and ADRB1 AA genotypes in the native ethnic group and with the ACE ID genotype in the non-indigenous population.
