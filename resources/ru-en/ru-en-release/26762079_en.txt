AIM  To prove the surgical safety and functional efficiency of jejunogastroplasty with duodenal passage preservation as an alternative method of gastrointestinal tract reconstruction after gastrectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was analyzed the results of treatment of 60 patients who underwent gastrectomy for stomach cancer for the period from September 2009 to May 2013.
Two congeneric groups by 30 patients who underwent Roux-en-Y reconstruction (control group) and jejunogastroplasty (comparison group) were prospectively compared.
RESULTS
Immediate results did not significantly differ in the both groups.  Blood loss was 528±61.0 and 507±71.2 ml, incidence of complications--20.0 and 6.7%, frequency of esophagostomy failure--3.3% and 0, postoperative mortality rate--3.3% and 0, duration of postoperative hospital-stay--12.4±1.3 and 10.9±1.2 days respectively (p<0.05).
In remote postoperative period the number of patients with stable body mass index or its positive changes was 52.9 and 81.8% in control and main groups, with dumping syndrome--47.1 and 9.1%, with diarrhea--35.3 and 4.5% respectively (p<0.05).
Index of good state of health in main group was 68.2%, in control group--17.6% (p<0.05).
In authors' opinion safety and physiological efficiency of jejunogastroplasty allow you considering its priority for primary reconstruction after gastrectomy and alternativeness to Roux-en-Y technique.
