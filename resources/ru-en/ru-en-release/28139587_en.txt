[The use of self-adapting system files (SAF) for controlling microbial biofilms of root canals in the treatment of apical periodontitis].  The aim of this study was to conduct a clinical and laboratory study and evaluate the effectiveness of endodontic root canal treatment using a self-adapting files system (SAF) in the complex treatment of patients with chronic apical periodontitis.
3% sodium hypochlorite solution was used as irrigation agent in all groups which included 20 patients treated with conventional manual tools, 21 patients receiving treatment with ultrasonic activation of irrigant and 26 patients treated with SAF system.
Root canal biofilm structure was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Quantum 3D microscope (USA).
Clinical efficiency of the root canal treatment was assessed by complications frequency a year after treatment.  SEM revealed the presence of high levels of microbial contamination of dentine tubules in the apical portion of the tooth.
In standard method group the percentage of re-treatment and surgery was higher than in the studied groups.
Use of SAF irrigation system was associated with a decrease in the number of identified pathogens.
However, the study revealed high resistance of Enterococcus spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Candida albicans to all types of endodontic treatment, so the improvement of methods of root canal microbial biofilms removing need to be continued.
