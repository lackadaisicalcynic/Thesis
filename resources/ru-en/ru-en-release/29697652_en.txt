[The distribution of interleukins and cytokines in the mucous membranes of the nose and the nasopharynx in the patients presenting with the post-nasal drip syndrome].
The objective of the present study was to elucidate the distribution of interleukins and cytokines in the mucous membranes of the nose and the nasopharynx in the patients presenting with the post-nasal drip syndrome.
The study included 20 patients with this pathological condition and 20 volunteers who comprised the control group.
The samples of the mucous membranes of the nose and the nasopharynx were examined with the use of the immunohistochemical methods to identify the protein gene product 9.5, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, the tumour necrosis factor-alpha, nuclear factor-kB, and beta-defensin.
It was shown that the post-nasal drip syndrome is characterized by the enhanced content of the protein gene product 9.5, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, the tumour necrosis factor-alpha, nuclear factor-kB, and beta-defensin in the mucous membranes of the nose and the nasopharynx.
