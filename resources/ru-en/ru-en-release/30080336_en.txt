[Structure and cytoarchitectonic of the lymphoid tissue of the Appendix of man in elderly and senile ages.]
In recent years in many countries with increasing duration of human life, there is an aging population.  In this regard, studies of lymphoid tissue that provides immune processes in the human body, are of particular relevance.
It was studied lymphoid tissue of the Appendix person aged 54-81 and 26-35 years with histological and statistical methods.
In the older age groups there was a reduction and restructuring of lymphoid tissue with partial modified lymphoid nodules.
Most nodules have no light centers to continue the process of blast transformation.
In the central zones of the nodules with light center observed mitoses.
There is an active migration of the lymphocytes in the lymphatic channel.
The condition of the lymphoid tissue of the appendix depends on the individual characteristics of the human body.
In some cases, people of advanced age are noted for its complete reduction and closure of the lumen of the organ.
