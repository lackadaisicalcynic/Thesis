[The efficacy of botulinotherapy in the correction of the pain syndrome and quality of life of patients with cervical dystonia].
AIM  To evaluate the severity of pain, emotional status and humoral serotonin in patients with cervical dystonia (CD) before and after the botulinotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A simple, open, comparative study of clinical characteristics of hyperkinesis, pain and emotional status, quality of life and contents of serum and blood platelet serotonin in 48 patients (32 women and 16 men) with CD, in age from 37 to 53 years, before and one month after the botulinotherapy with disport in dose of 500--1000 U was carried out.
A control group included 15 healthy people.
RESULTS
All patients (100%) complained of involuntary movements and pain in the neck.
The overall score on a scale of dystonic movements in the group of patients was 16,7±7,7 points, on TWSTRS - 46,48±6,2 points, on the Visual Analogue Scale, the average level of pain was 6,4±1,08 points.
The degree of depression according to the Hamilton scale was significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to the control group.
The level of trait and state anxiety measured with the Spielberger-Khanin scale was significantly higher (p<0.005) in patients with CD than in the controls.
The correlation analysis revealed a direct dependence of the intensity of pain subscale TWSTRS with the degree of anxiety on the Hamilton scale and the amount of final points of dystonic movements.
The level of serotonin in the serum was significantly lower in patients compared to the controls.
After botulinotherapy, pain scores, anxiety and depression have significantly decreased and the level of blood platelet serotonin has increased.
CONCLUSION
Botulinotherapy with dysport in CD patients reduces the degree of pain, depression, improves quality of life and stimulates the serotoninergic system.
