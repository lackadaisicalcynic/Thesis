[Use of mesenchymal stem cells in the combination therapy of ulcerative colitis].
AIM
To compare results of treatment in patients with moderate and severe ulcerative colitis (UC), receiving standart anti-inflammatory therapy (second group) and its combination with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) (first group).  RESULTS
Complex therapy of UC acute flare-up, including MSC did not influence on reccurence frequency, remission duration and mean value of clinical and endoscopic activity indices during 1 year of follow-up: in 1 group UC flare-up occurred in 2 (16.7%) patients, in 2 group--in 3 patients (30%).  RR was 0.3 (95% CI 0/08--1.36; p=0.2; x2=1.47).
After 2 years of follow-up risk of UC exacerbation in 1 group was 3 times lower than in the 2 group (p=0.03).
Mean duration of remission in the 1 group was 22 months, in the 2 group--17 months (p=0.049).
After 3 years of follow-up remission duration in the 1 and 2 groups were 22 and 22 months, respectively (p=0.66).
Activity Index according to Rachmilevich in the 1 group was 4.75+/-1.13 points, in the 2--8.1+/-1.1 points (p=0.001).
CONCLUSION
MSC application increases efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with acute exacerbation of UC.
