[Treatment of postoperative vasospasm after insular tumor removal by intra-arterial administration of verapamil (analysis of two clinical cases and a literature review)].
PURPOSE
We describe our experience of using intra-arterial administration of Verapamil to resolve vasospasm in two patients who underwent surgery for insular glial tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Severe vasospasm (an increased systolic LBFV in the M1 MCA, more than 250 cm/s, and a Lindegaard index of 4.1) was observed in 2 (3.2%) of 62 patients in the early postoperative period after removal of intracerebral insular tumors.  In both cases, vasospasm was confirmed by angiography, was clinically significant, and manifested by the development of pyramidal hemisyndrome.
RESULTS
Intra-arterial administration of Verapamil led to relief of angiospasm, which was confirmed by angiographic data, and complete regression of neurological symptoms.
CONCLUSION  Vasospasm symptoms in patients after removal of insular tumors largely resemble those after aneurysm hemorrhage.
An increase in the LBFV in the MCA and related neurological symptoms develop lately and persists for up to 2 weeks after surgery.
LBFV values are similar to those in patients after SAH and reach 250-300 cm/s.  Among the causes of focal symptoms developed after removal of insular tumors, injury to the inner capsule structures, injury to arteries of the MCA territory (especially perforators), and angiospasm should be differentiated.
