[The role of clinical laboratory diagnostics in dental caries prognosis in children].
The aim of the study was to identify informative, in terms of predicting caries process, laboratory parameters of homeostasis of the oral cavity in children of different age groups.
A total of 1158 children of preschool and school age with caries were screened to determine laboratory parameters of homeostasis of the oral cavity by examining of the oral fluid.
Caries in children was characterized by certain age specific physico-chemical parameters shift in the oral fluid.
Complex set of the most informative laboratory indices reflecting the resistance and susceptibility to dental caries in children of different age groups was revealed.
The obtained data allowed creating mathematical models for prenosological prediction of caries in preschool and school age, which formed the basis of "Stop caries" software.
