[The addition of memantine to galantamine increases treatment efficacy in patients with moderate dementia with Lewy bodies].
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the most frequent cause of dementia in the elderly.  Both open and few placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of monotherapy with cholinesterase inhibitors (CI) and memantine in the treatment of these patients.
However the efficacy and safety of combined therapy with CI and memantine are poorly studied.
AIM
To assess the efficacy of modern antidementia drugs (memantine and galantamine).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-eight patients with DLB were studied.
Monotherapy with galantamine in the dose of 16 mg/day was used during the first 6 months in according with current therapeutic recommendations.
Then 19 patients who responded to treatment received in addition memantine in the dose of 20 mg/day.
Patients' state was assessed using a battery of scales and tests.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The combination of memantine and galantamine significantly improved attention, memory, speech functions and behavior.
Therefore, the early treatment with the combination of CI and memantine may be effective in treatment of DLB.
