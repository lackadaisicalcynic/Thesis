[Modern approaches to treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease].
Psychotic disorders in Parkinson's disease (PDPD) are common and significantly influence the quality of life and disability level.
The pathogenesis of PDPD is complex and not yet fully understood.
Taking into consideration the features of the Parkinson's disease (usually older patients with a risk of cognitive decline), and the pharmacodynamics of the antiparkinsonian and traditional antipsychotic drugs, the management of PDPD is a challenging issue of clinical neurology and psychiatry.  In this systematic review, scientific publications for the period 2014-2016 were analyzed within two bibliographic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed and eLIBRARY.RU.
Additionally, the guidelines of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society, American Academy of Neurology and European Academy of Neurology were included in the analysis.
Clozapine is recommended to use in the treatment of PDPD, quetiapine is possible to use, pimavanserin will probably become a remedy of choice.  Nonpharmacological approaches have positive effects on the general condition of the patients with PDPD, however the efficacy of such approaches to treat psychosis is unclear.
