[Impact of shock-wave therapy on the clinical and functional status of patients with coronary heart disease].
AIM  To study of the impact of shock-wave therapy (SWT) on the functional status of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Thirty-four CHD patients (including 33 men) with left ventricular (LV) asynergic segments, as evidenced by echocardiography (EchoCG), were examined.
Their mean age was 60.1±1.76 years.
All the patients received a SWT cycle according to the standard scheme.
The patient examination protocol involved EchoCG, dobutamine EchoCG, treadmill exercise EchoCG, and tissue Doppler EchoCG, which were performed at baseline, immediately and one month after the end of a SWT cycle.
RESULTS
Following a SWT cycle, all the patients were noted to have a significant decrease in mean angina pectoris and heart failure functional classes and in the frequency of daily intake of nitrates.
EchoCG showed that at baseline the LV ejection fraction (EF) was 51.1±1.02%; end- diastolic volume index, 71.5±3.6 ml/m2; end-systolic volume index, 34.4±2.2 ml/m2.
According to exercise EchoCG, the tolerance threshold was 6.4±0.1 Меts (Bruce protocol); the total exercise time of 5.05±0.23 min was achieved in an average of 75.2±1.32%.
Immediately and one month after a SWT cycle, there was an increment in EF from 51.1±1.02 to 55±0.8 and 57±1.7%, respectively; a substantial increase in the tolerance threshold to 8.17±0.24 and 9.45±0.34 Меts, as compared to the baseline values.
The exercise time increased up to 6.41±0.17 and 7.7±0.29 min immediately and one month after SWT, respectively.
The increment in EF in response to exercise was 8.54±2.12, 14±1.5, and 16±1.2% at baseline, immediately and one month after SWT, respectively.
Moreover, myocardial relaxation and diastolic function improved.
CONCLUSION
Shock-wave therapy in patients with CHD is accompanied by their improved functional status, which is manifested by increased tolerance threshold and exercise duration, a rise in rest and exercise LV EF, better relaxation of LV, and its diminished stiffness.
