[Hereditary pheochromocytoma-associated syndromes.  Part 2].  Pheochromocytoma (PCC)/paraganglioma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor of the paraganglion.
The hereditary variants of PCC have been previously considered to occur in 10% of cases.
The latest researches have clearly demonstrated that the hereditary cause of chromaffin tumors is revealed in a much larger number of patients.
There have been the most investigated NF, RET, VHL, SDHD, SDHC, and SDHB gene mutations.
New EGLN1/PHD2, KIF1В, SDH5/SDHAF2, IDH1, TMEM127, SDHA, MAX, and HIF2А gene mutations have been recently discovered.
This review describes the most common PCC-associated syndromes in detail and considers the specific features of new mutations.
