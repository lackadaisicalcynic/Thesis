[Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis with renal involvement: A historic aspect of the problem].  The paper presents the steps for studying cryoglobulinemia from essential to cryoglobulinemic vasculitis associated with hepatitis C virus.  It shows advances in the study of the etiology of cryoglobulinemia, diagnosis, specific features of renal injury, and current approaches to treating HCV infection-related cryoglobulinemic vasculitis with renal involvement, by using 3 clinical cases (with a difference of a few decades during a follow-up).
