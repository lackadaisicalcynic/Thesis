[A role of neuroprotective therapy in the rehabilitation of children with sensorineural hearing loss, IV degrees, after cochlear implanta-tion].  OBJECTIVE
To study clinical/psychological characteristics in children with sensorineural hearing loss, IV degrees, before and after the cochlear implantation (CI) and to assess the dynamics of speech development during the rehabilitation using the neuroprotective drug cerebrolysin.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 93 patients, aged from 5 to 8 years.
The main group (n=46) received cerebrolysin, the control group was not treated with this drug.  A diagnostic study included patient's history, neurological and neuropsychological examinations, auditory perception and sound reproduction.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  According to the Meaningful Use of Speech Scale, 23% of children of the main group demonstrated the best results due to the better speech communication strategies.
No significant between-group differences were found in the level of auditory perception 6 months after CI.
The level of articulation was higher in the main group.  Cognitive functioning was improved in children treated with cerebrolysin.
