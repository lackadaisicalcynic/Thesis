[Ischaemic postconditioning of the heart.
Analysis of experimental findings].  The data of publications regarding the influence of experimental atherosclerosis on the infarct-limiting effect of ischaemic postconditioning (IPost) are controversial.
The presented information is suggestive that ageing removes or attenuates the infarct-limiting effect of postconditioning but does not influence the antiarrhythmic effect of IPost.  The majority of experimental data report that streptozotocin-induced diabetes removes the infarct-limiting effect of IPost.
The data concerning type 2 diabetes mellitus are controversial: some authors state that such diabetes completely levels the cardioprotecting effect of IPost; others tell that it only attenuates but does not remove the infarct-limiting effect of IPost.
Postconditioning in rats with elevated arterial pressure prevents the appearance of reperfusion cardiac contractility dysfunction and exerts an infarct-limiting effect.
Cardiac hypertrophy, postinfarction remodelling and dilatation cardiomyopathy do not influence the infarct-limiting and inotropic effect of postconditioning.
According to the majority of publications, IPost enhances the inotropic and cardioprotecting effect of cardioplegia.  The data of literature sources regarding the effect of gender on efficacy of IPost are limited.
