[Microflora of laryngeal mucosa in the healthy subjects and the patients presenting with non-specific post-intubation laryngeal granuloma].  This comparative study was designed to determine the qualitative and quantitative composition of microflora of laryngeal mucosa in the healthy subjects and the patients presenting with non-specific post-intubation laryngeal granuloma.  The secondary objective was to measure the sensitivity of the isolated microorganisms to antibiotic therapy.
The quantitative characteristic and the species composition of the microbial associations in laryngeal mucosa were investigated in 40 healthy subjects and 72 patients presenting with non-specific post-intubation laryngeal granuloma.
The mean age of the participants of the study varied from 31 to 69 years.
The total microbial population density in the healthy subjects was 2.672±614 CFU/ml compared with 21.514±2.382 CFU/ml in the patients.
The healthy subjects were found to carry streptococci in 87.5% of the cases, staphylococci and neisseria in 60.0% and 42.5% of the cases respectively.
As many as 77.8%, 83.3%, and 90.3% of the patients with non-specific post-intubation laryngeal granuloma were carriers of these microorganism respectively.
The dominant microorganisms in the mucous membrane of the larynx in these patients were N. flavescence (17.6%), S. aureus (9.01%), S. pneumonia (7.3%), and S. pyogenes (6.0%).The staphylococci isolated from the mucous membrane of the larynx of the patients presenting with non-specific post-intubation laryngeal granuloma exhibited the highest sensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics (cefuroxime, cefprome or ceftriaxone) and fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) antibiotics (100, 100, 91.7 and 96.7% respectively).
