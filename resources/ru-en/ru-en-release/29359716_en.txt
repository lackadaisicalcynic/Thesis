[Epileptic syndromes in childhood associated with secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures].
AIM  To study a group of patients with secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (SGTCS) in view of nosology, medical history, clinical, electroencephalographic and neuroimaging features.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 471 patients, 244 (51.8%) men and 227 (48.2%) women.
RESULTS
SGTCS were observed in many epileptic syndromes.
The most frequent were symptomatic focal epilepsy (33.8%), cryptogenic focal epilepsy (23.8%), rolandic epilepsy (12.6%), FEBL-BEDC syndrome (12.3%).
Other forms of epilepsy were less frequent.
The onset of epilepsy ranged over a wide age range from the first month of life to 18 years.
The average age of onset was 5.7Â±4.96 years.
SGTCS as the only type of paroxysms were observed in 28.3% of cases.
Two or more types of seizures were observed in 71.7% of patients, three or more types in 39.3%.
Epileptiform activity on EEG during long VEM was detected in 91.3% of patients with SGTCS.
In 37.2% of patients, benign epileptiform discharges of childhood were recorded.
Treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEP) led to complete remission in 57.1% of cases of epilepsy associated with SGTCS.
A reduction of the frequency of seizures by 50% or more was found in 33.6% of patients treated with AEP.
No effect was observed in 9.3% of patients.
CONCLUSION
Significant differences in the prognosis and therapeutic approaches to specific epileptic syndromes associated with SGTCS necessitate the use of the entire spectrum of diagnostic measures, which should include careful history taking, clinical examination, video-EEG monitoring with the inclusion of sleep dynamics, MRI / CT brain, genetic testing.
