[The influence of growing seizure readiness on the autonomic regulation of the heart].
AIM  To study the functional state of the heart in a progressive increase of seizure readiness (SR) due to pentylenetetrazole kindling.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was carried out on male rats of the Wistar line.
Simultaneous telemetric monitoring of electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram on-line was used.  Individual SR of animals in 7- and 27 day pentylenetetrazole kindling was determined.
RESULTS
The decrease in the index of LF/HF after 7 days of kindling reflects a compensatory reaction of the autonomic nervous system.
However, the increase in SI indicates that the result obtained at the price of considerable stress regulation mechanisms.
The increase in QTc, Tpeak Tend and reduced SDNN and TP suggest that compensatory mechanisms cannot prevent the high risk of life-threatening arrhythmias.
High SR after 27 days of kindling is accompanied by a shift of autonomic balance towards the growth of tone of the sympathetic system which may lead to decompensation and prenosological state.  CONCLUSION
The characteristics of autonomic regulation of the heart in progressive SR are important for fundamental and clinical cardioneurology.
