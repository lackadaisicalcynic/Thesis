[Complex treatment results in a congenital glaucoma patient (case report)].  Early diagnosis of congenital glaucoma allows surgery to be performed at the stage of reversible glaucomatous alterations of the optic disc and retina.
In primary congenital glaucoma, the main reason for visual acuity reduction following surgical stabilization of the intraocular pressure are corneal changes.  These include an increased corneal diameter, Haab's striae, areas of thickening and a greater posterior elevation.
The resultant irregular astigmatism leads to amblyopia and a marked decrease in visual acuity.
Active pleoptic treatment started from a very early age in children operated on for compensated congenital glaucoma provides them an opportunity to achieve high visual acuity and full rehabilitation.
