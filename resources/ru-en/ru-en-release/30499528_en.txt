[Intraoperative prevention of dacryocystitis relapse].  The article reviews the literature devoted to modern intraoperative methods of preventing cicatricial process at the site of dacryostoma after endonasal endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy.
Despite the constant improvement of the surgery technique, complications in the postoperative period still occur.  They include the formation of granulation tissue at the sites of dacryostoma, synechiae in the nasal cavity, or narrowing of the dacryostoma, which ultimately leads to a relapse of the disease.
The main prevention methods are construction of flaps from the medial wall of the lacrimal sac, from mucosa of the nasal cavity, and intubation of the dacryostoma with the lacrimal implant.
They are used separately and in various combinations.
