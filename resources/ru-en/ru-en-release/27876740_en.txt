[The application of the biologically compatible cyanacrylate-based glue for ossiculoplasty in the patients presenting with chronic otitis media].  The objective of the study was to improve the functional outcomes of the treatment in the patients presenting with chronic otitis media by means of the combined application of platelet-enriched plasma and the biologically compatible cyanacrylate-based glue for the fixation of the reconstructed auditory ossicular chain.
The functional results of the surgery were evaluated within 1, 3, and12 months after the intervention making use of tonal threshold audiometry.
It was shown that the use of the platelet-enriched plasma with its subsequent fixation by the biologically compatible cyanacrylate-based glue enhances stability of the implanted prosthetic elements, reduces the risk of their displacement during the postoperative period due to the formation of the cicatrical tissue between the structural components of the middle ear.  This approach improves the functional result of the described treatment and decreases the frequency of relapses associated with poor stability of the reconstructed sound-conducting system.
