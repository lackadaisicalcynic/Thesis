[Antegrade endobiliary interventions in undilated bile ducts].  AIM
To show advisability of antegrade transhepatic approach to bile ducts for benign and malignant biliary diseases if endoscopic technique is impossible or ineffective.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
38 patients underwent external biliary drainage followed by endobiliary interventions for the period 2009-2016.  RESULTS
In all patients treatment was effective and included following manipulations: antegrade balloon dilatation of stricture of biliodigestive anastomosis, papillodilatation, antegrade dislocation of calculuses from common bile duct to duodenum.  There were 2 cases of complications after antegrade interventions.
1 woman died from severe pancreatic necrosis.
CONCLUSION
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiostomy on undilated bile ducts is effective for temporary biliary drainage in closure of external duodenal or biliary fistula, treatment of intra-abdominal bilema.
The method is indicated in elective endobiliary interventions for choledocholithiasis management, elimination of stricture of biliodigestive anastomosis of major duodenal papilla if endoscopic or conventional approaches are impossible or ineffective.
