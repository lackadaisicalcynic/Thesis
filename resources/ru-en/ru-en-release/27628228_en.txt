Esophagogastrectomy with simultaneous intestinal repair.
AIM
to present treatment of patients with gastroesophageal cancer.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
41 cases of esophagogastrectomy with simultaneous intestinal repair were analyzed.
There were 37 operations for malignancies and 4 operations for benign diseases.
Indications for surgery were defined.
Abdominocervical access was predominantly used.  In 6 patients esophageal repair was finished by high intrapleural anastomosis due to insufficient length of the graft for cervical anastomosis.
Surgical technique of esophagogastrectomy was described in detail at all stages.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Better functional results were achieved in isoperistaltic esophagocoloplasty when graft's aboral end was anastomosed with Roux-segment of jejunum or with vertical bend of duodenum in end-to-side fashion.
Mortality rate was 12.2%.
CONCLUSION
We consider that isoperistaltic repair on left colonic vessels has better functional results.
