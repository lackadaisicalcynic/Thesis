[Pancreatoduodenectomy: learning curve within single multi-field center].  AIM
To analyze learning curve by using of immediate results of pancreatoduodenectomy at multi-field oncology institute.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period 2010-2016 at Abdominal Oncology Department of Herzen Moscow Oncology Research Institute 120 pancreatoduodenal resections were consistently performed.  All patients were divided into two groups: the first 60 procedures (group A) and subsequent 60 operations (group B).
Herewith, first 60 operations were performed within the first 4.5 years of study period, the next 60 operations - within remaining 2.5 years.
RESULTS
Learning curves showed significantly variable intraoperative blood loss (1100 ml and 725 ml), surgery time (589 min and 513 min) and postoperative hospital-stay (15 days and 13 days) in group A followed by gradual improvement of these values in group B. Incidence of negative resection margin (R0) was also significantly improved in the last 60 operations (70 and 92%, respectively).
CONCLUSION
Despite pancreatoduodenectomy is one of the most difficult surgical interventions in abdominal surgery learning curve will differ from one surgeon to another.
