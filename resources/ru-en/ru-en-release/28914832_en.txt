AIM  To consider surgical tactics and to study the immediate results of primary enteroenterostomy in surgical treatment of malignant colonic obstruction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Radical surgery was performed in 170 (63.9%) out of 266 patients with malignant obstructive colonic obstruction.
Colonic resection followed by anastomosis was performed in 68 patients.
Conventional hemicolectomy (9 patients) and various original techniques of Y-shaped ileotransversanastomoses (27 patients) were used for right-sided tumor process.
In case of left-sided tumor we used intraoperative colonic irrigation with enterosorption (20 operations), Y-shaped anastomoses (9 operations) and subtotal colectomy (3 operations).
RESULTS
There was significantly increased mortality in patients with sub- and decompensated stages of malignant colonic obstruction.
Postoperative mortality after radical surgery was 10.6%, after palliative interventions - 21.9%.
There was similar postoperative mortality after various types of radical interventions with/without enteroenterostomy (8.8% and 11.8%, respectively).
CONCLUSION
In favorable clinical situation radical surgery with tumor removal at the first emergency stage should be preferred for malignant colonic obstruction.  At the specialized hospital segmental colonic resection with primary anastomosis is possible after comprehensive assessment of surgical risk, intraoperative colonic irrigation is obligatory for left-sided tumor.
This approach increases surgical effectiveness and provides early rehabilitation.
