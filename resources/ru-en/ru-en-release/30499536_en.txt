The study included 60 patients with previously operated stage I and II POAG who has 'b-c' intraocular pressure (IOP) on maximum hypotensive therapy.  Fistulizing subscleral removal of the outer wall of Schlemm's canal (a.k.a. subscleral sinusotomy) was the first stage of treatment plan.
The second stage took place 14 days later in the form of laser trabeculoplasty.
In order to reduce the risk of IOP spikes, all patients were prescribed specific hypotensive therapy 5 days prior to the procedure.  The 1st group included 30 patients (30 eyes) who were asked to use Brimonidine-Purite (0.15%).
The 2nd group included 30 patients (30 eyes) who used either nonselective β-blockers, or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.  IOP was measured on days 1, 5, 9, and 12 after stage 1, as well as after laser trabeculoplasty.
RESULTS  After the combined laser-surgical treatment, the IOP reliably decreased in both groups.
Choroidal effusion was observed in 7 cases in the 1st group and in 15 cases in the 2nd group.  Change in IOP was less prominent in patients who had received instillations of α2-adrenomimetic (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION  Patients who received Brimonidine-Purite 0.15% before laser trabeculoplasty had lower IOP drop than those on pre-surgical therapy with nonselective β-blockers or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
