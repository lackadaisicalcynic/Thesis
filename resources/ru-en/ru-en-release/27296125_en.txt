[The effect of gender on the results of related kidney transplantation].
AIM
To define the effect of donor and recipient gender on the results of kidney transplantation from living related donor.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Group of 271 patients who underwent kidney transplantation from living related donor was analyzed.  There were 115 women and 156 men.
Age varied from 1 to 63 years (mean 21.30±12.32).  There were 127 children aged 1-18 years (mean 11.28±4.63) and 144 adults aged 19-63 years (mean 29.81±11.24).
Donors included 162 women and 109 men.
Overall survival was calculated using Kaplan-Mayer.  Mortality and incidence of transplants failure were determined using Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS
All patients were divided into 2 groups depending on recipients' gender and then into 4 subgroups depending on gender of donors and recipients.
Comparative statistical analysis showed that transplants survival was higher in women vs. men (T=2.7, p=0.007).  Survival of patients was similar in both groups.
Moreover it was the best in subgroup of recipients-women with kidneys from donors-men.
Difference was statistically significant (T=2.16, p=0.03).  There was no significant difference in all other cases.
CONCLUSION
The results of kidney transplantation are better in recipients-women than in men.
