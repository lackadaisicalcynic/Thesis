[The type of age-related cataract as available marker of socially significant diseases of the organism].
The aim of the research was to investigate the general somatic status and to investigate the influence of dominating part of vegetative nervous system, following the different types of senile cataract formation in human.  Thus, the domination Ð° sympathetic nervous system and correlated systemic dystrophic changes of the tissues in patients with cortical cataract have been found for the first time.
Moreover, patients with nuclear cataract had the domination of parasympathetic nervous system and another character of dystrophic changes.  Therefore, the type of a forming age-related cataract can be offered as an available clinical marker of character of neurodystrophic process occurring in an organism.
