[Complex treatment of recurrent herpetic stomatitis with dysbiosis].  Research objective was to study the effectiveness of complex treatment of recurrent herpetic stomatitis with dysbiosis.
The study included 147 patients aged from 18 to 45 years with recurrent herpetic stomatitis (RGS) and disbyosis divided in 3 groups.  Group 1 received conventional antiviral and symptomatic treatment of RGS, in group 2 complex immunoglobulins (IgA (15-25%), IgM (15-25%) and Ig (50-70%)) were added to conventional therapy, group 3 received immunoglobulins only.
Clinical and immunological efficiency was estimated by values of oral local immunity (SlgA, lysozyme), humoral immunity (IgE and IgG) and cellular immunity (RBTL with FGA, defined T-lymphocytes).
Significant (p<0.05) increase of lisozyme and SlgA, RBTL with FGA, number of T-lymphocytes and IgG concentration was observed in group 2.  The obtained data allow improving quality of treatment of recurrent herpetic stomatitis with related dysbiosis.
