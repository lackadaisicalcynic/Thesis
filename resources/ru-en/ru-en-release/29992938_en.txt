[Cephalometric evaluation of the effect of dynamax and monoblock appliances on vertical facial height in patients with distal malocclusion].  The most common abnormality in orthodontics is distal malocclusion.
The patient will benefit more if is treated during active growth phase.  Various types of functional appliances are used in order to control maxillary and mandibular growth.
In this article we compared vertical changes in mandibular position as a result of 3 different distal malocclusion treatment methods.
To this end, groups consisting of, 17 patients treated with dynamax appliance, 17 patients treated with Monoblock appliance, 16 patients treated with a Monoblock-Headgear combination were created.
Research has shown that, treatment with removable functional appliances results in parallel downward positioning of mandible; treatment with semiremovable appliances results in backward and downward rotation of mandible and that the extraoral appliances are useless to control the lower facial height.
