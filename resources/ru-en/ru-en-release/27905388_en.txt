[Prognostic biochemical markers of thrombolytic therapy in ischemic stroke].
AIM
To assess prognostic value of endothelial dysfunction, endogenous intoxication and oxidative stress in the acute period of ischemic stroke (II) at the stage of making a decision on using thrombolytic therapy (TLT) as well during the follow-up in order to personalize treatment.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 57 patients stratified into control group 1 (n=29) and TLT group (n=28).  Contents of C-reactive protein (Nsrb), matrixmetalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) erythrocyte lipid peroxidation products were measured in the blood of patients.
Clinical outcomes were evaluated with the modified Rankin scale and the Rivermead Mobility Index.
RESULTS
Increased levels of Nsrb and MMP-9 were the biomarkers of poor TLT outcome.
CONCLUSION
TLT has a positive effect on the basic patterns of IS pathogenesis and biochemical predictors allow to rationalize the treatment.
