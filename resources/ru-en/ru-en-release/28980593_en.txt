[CFD-simulation of the air flows in the maxillary sinus].  This article summarizes the results of computer simulation of the air flows in the nasal cavity and the maxillary sinus by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method.
The objective of the study was to apply the method of computational aerodynamics to simulate the air flows in the nasal cavity and the maxillary sinus under the normal conditions and after the surgical interventions on the middle nasal meatus.
The normal air space of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses was simulated and the computer modeling of the main options for the surgical approach to the maxillary sinus through the middle nasal meatus was performed including balloon sinuplasty, functional endoscopic sinus surgery, and uncinate process mobilization.
The study has demonstrated the increase of the air flow velocity in the maxillary sinus after computer-assisted balloon sinuplasty.  The computer simulation of functional endoscopic sinus surgery including the removal of the uncinated process revealed the mass exchange between the maxillary sinus and the nasal cavity.
