[Seven principles in the treatment of vestibular vertigo and results of the study of VIRTUOSO].
This article reports the results of the international post-marketing observational program VIRTUOSO aimed at the evaluation of the efficacy of betahistine dihydrochloride at the dose of 48 mg/day for 1-2 months in patients with paroxysmal vertigo of various origins.
The clinical response was rated as good, very good or excellent in 74.1% of the patients (p<0.001).  Monthly vertigo attack frequency with betahistine decreased in average from 8.0 to 3.0 (p<0.001).
Vertigo attack frequency further decreased during the 2-month follow-up after the end of betahistine treatment.  No serious adverse effects of betahistine have been reported.
