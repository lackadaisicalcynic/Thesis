[Hypothalamic regulation of retinal function].  UNLABELLED
Studying compensatory capacity of the brain is a pressing issue.  To resolve it, diversified experiments should be conducted providing an idea of the underlying mechanisms and possibilities of functional restoration.
AIM
To determine the effect of unilateral electrocoagulation of supraoptic (SO) and suprachiasmatic (SCH) hypothalamic nuclei on the appearance of the electroretinogram (ERG).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We conducted chronic experiments on awake rabbits with a total duration of 30 days.  RESULTS
The study revealed considerable changes in the total ERG amplitude (reduction) as well as the amplitudes of a- and b-waves.
Thus, for the first 15-30 minutes after coagulation the b-wave showed an increase, while the a-wave appeared completely suppressed.  Longer postcoagulation periods were associated with gradual, though incomplete, amplitude regain of the latter.
CONCLUSION
The obtained data suggest that the process of ERG recovery involves compensatory mechanisms of the SO and SCH nuclei that enable partial recovery of the neurotransmitter activity of the retina.
