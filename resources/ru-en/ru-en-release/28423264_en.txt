The article used the methods of assessment of knee function, structure and functional activity in elderly patients with osteoarthritis to represent in terms of the ICF structure and subsequent evaluation of the rehabilitation patient profile and effectiveness of medical rehabilitation of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.
It is shown that the inclusion in the program of rehabilitation of older patients with osteoarthritis of the knee EHF-IR therapy provides a more pronounced clinical effect.
An analysis of the profile of the rehabilitation of patients shows positive dynamics of all three components of the assessment of the rehabilitated patients (function, structure, activity).
The data confirm the possibility of using the ICF in its use as a criterion for the scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of rehabilitation of patients with osteoarthritis.
