[Comorbidity of cardiovascular diseases and cancers: Problems in the diagnosis of cardiotoxic effects of chemo- and radiation therapy].  Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancers are the leaders in their prevalence and the major causes of death in economically developed countries, determining their high sociomedical significance in society.
Improvement of methods for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancers has contributed to increases in relapse-free survival and life expectancy in these patients.
At the same time, the new problems have emerged particularly in the development of various cardiovascular events/diseases when treating cancer, which may predict worse prognosis in patients and be an independent cause of death.
To search for new markers of cardiotoxicity at early stages and to develop effective methods for the prevention and personalized treatment of cancer and CVD are the problems that can be solved only by joint efforts of cardiologists and oncologists.
