[An efficacy of carotid arteries repair for tortuosity combined with stenosis].
AIM
To assess an efficacy of carotid arteries reconstruction in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis combined with tortuosity.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
All patients were divided into groups depending on type of surgery: group I - open carotid endarterectomy (CEA) followed by obligatory repair with synthetic patch (31 (36%) patients); group II - eversion CEA with ICA resection, redressation and reimplantation into own ostium (35 (40.7%) patients); group III - ICA replacement (20 (23.3%) patients).
Synthetic prosthesis and autovein were used in 13 (65%) and 7 (35%) patients respectively.
The study included patients with ICA stenosis â‰¥60% (any type of plaque) and any degree of cerebrovascular insufficiency or ICA stenosis <60% (plaque type I-III) with CVI grade II-IV combined with S- or C-tortuosity, bend or loop with blood flow velocity over 110 cm/s and its turbulence.
Only 6 (7.0%) out of 86 patients had no clinical signs of CVI/previous stroke.
Asymptomatic/symptomatic patients ratio was following in all groups: group I - 12 (38.7%)/19 (61.3%); group II - 29 (82.9%)/6 (17.1%); group III - 10 (50%)/10 (50%).
RESULTS
Within 6-month follow-up 22 (70.9%) out of 31 patients were asymptomatic in group I, 30 (85.7%) (p=0.9475) out of 35 - in group II, 9 (45%) (p=0.9511) out of 20 patients - in group III and 1 (5%) patient developed thrombosis of the reconstruction zone followed by ischemic stroke.
After 12 months following patients were asymptomatic: 22 (70.9%) in group I, 30 (85.7%) (p=0.9475) in group II and 9 (45%) patients (p=0.9511) in group III. After 1 year 4 (33.3%) out of 12 patients with CVI grade IV had partial regression of focal neurological symptoms.
CONCLUSION
Surgery for ICA tortuosity combined with stenosis confirmed its efficacy and safety for both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.
Significantly better results were observed in eversion CEA compared with conventional procedure and ICA replacement.
