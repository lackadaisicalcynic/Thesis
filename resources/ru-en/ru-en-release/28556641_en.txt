[Age-related changes Kernogan`s index of venous vessels hollow and parenchymatous organs at stages of a postnatal ontogenesis].
Kernogan`s index determination of hollow and parenchymatous organs' venous vessels was conducted on 80 men corpses of the three age groups.
Average age of the investigated men corpses of the mature period is 27,8±4,2 years, elderly - 67,8±3,7 years, senile - 81,9±4,5 years.  The age variability transformation of venous vessels bandwidth of lungs, kidneys, heart, stomach and ileum were obligate.
It was revealed that the Kernogan`s index of venous vessels changes can be equally detected at different age periods.
While, with the obsolence, there is a gradual indicator's decline, which is mostly discerned in parenchymatous organs, while for the hollow organs transformations are less essentic.
