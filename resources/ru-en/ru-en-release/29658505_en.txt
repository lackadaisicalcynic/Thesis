[The possibilities of neurostimulation (sympathetic correction) in the treatment of amnestic (Korsakoff's) psychosis].  AIM
To evaluate the efficacy of non-invasive multichannel electrical stimulation (sympathetic correction) in patients with alcohol amnesic (Korsakoff's) psychosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Thirty-seven men, aged 33-48 years, with Korsakoff's (amnestic) psychosis were studied.
The duration of disease varied from 12 to 24 month.  The device of electrical stimulation of neck nerve structures was used for neuroelectrostimulation.
Treatment included 15 sessions within 3 weeks.
During this period, patients did not receive pharmacological therapy.
The Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to determine changes in cognitive state of patients.
Electroencephalography with qEEG analysis and spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were carried out as well.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Positive effects of treatment were observed in all patients that suggested the high therapeutic potential of the neuroelectrostimulation method.
