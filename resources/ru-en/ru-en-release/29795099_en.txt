[The role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in ameloblastoma formation].  The aim of the study was to assess the role of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the formation and clinical course of various histological variants of ameloblastoma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  76 cases of ameloblastoma were investigated, the average age of the patients was 46 years.
There were 49 (64.5%) cases of recurrence of the disease.
Tissue antigens were determined using monoclonal rabbit antibodies to Ki-67 and β-catenin.  RESULTS
it was found correlation between the proliferative activity of ameloblastoma cells and the intranuclear localization of β-catenin, indicating the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin-signaling pathway.  It was shown that the nuclear localization of β-catenin is positively correlated with the recurrence.
CONCLUSION
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in a formation and progression of ameloblastoma.
