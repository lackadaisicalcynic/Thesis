[Mixed infections and inflammatory ophthalmic diseases: clinical and laboratory observations].  In recent years, all medical specialists, including ophthalmologists, have been facing the problem of mixed infections.
Recurrent inflammation in the anterior and posterior eye segments is often a result of infection by more than one variety of pathogens.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Over the period 2013-2016, 34 patients (14 men and 20 women) with different inflammatory processes in the eye who appeared DNA-positive for mycoplasmas (Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum) and/or chlamydiae (Chlamydia trachomatis) (PCR testing of tear fluid and/or urine) were followed up.
All patients were examined for intensive production of herpesvirus, adenovirus, and enterovirus DNA in biological fluids.  After being consulted by related specialists, all the patients started local and systemic (antibacterial and antiviral) therapy.
In the end of the latter, laboratory tests were repeated.
RESULTS  Among all the clinical forms, anterior segment inflammation (i.e. of conjunctiva, cornea, and the anterior vascular tract) prevailed - 76%.
In most patients, mycoplasmas and/or chlamydiae formed associations with herpesviruses (n=19; 56%).  Bacterial DNA alone (mycoplasma and/or chlamydia) was detected in 12 cases (35%).
In 4 cases, mycoplasma and/or chlamydia DNA was detected in tear fluid, in 19 patients - in urine, and in 10 patients - in both secreta.
Local and systemic causal treatment enabled resolution of the complaints and symptoms and yielded negative results of follow-up laboratory tests.  CONCLUSION
More than a half of the patients demonstrated concomitant viral-bacterial infection (22 cases).  The presence of bacterial/viral DNA in biological secreta, as revealed by PCR, reflects the systemic nature of the infection process and, thus, necessitates engagement of related specialists (dermatologists, urologists, gynecologists).
