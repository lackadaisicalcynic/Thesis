[Subclavian-carotid replacement in chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency management].  AIM
To present own experience of subclavian-carotid replacement for chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency management.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
For 12 years 7 subclavian-carotid reconstructions were performed that was 1.2% of all carotid repairs during this period.  Great saphenous vein was always used as a graft.
Carotid endarterectomy from proximal internal carotid artery was additionally performed if it was necessary.
Patients had severe advanced lesion of supra-aortic vessels including bilateral carotid lesion and significant stenosis of ipsilateral proximal common carotid artery.
The vast majority of them had cerebrovascular insufficiency grade 3-4.
RESULTS
All patients underwent surgery without significant complications despite initially severe state due to advanced lesion of brachiocephalic arteries.
Long-term postoperative patency of the grafts was satisfactory within the period from 12 years to 1.5 months.
There were no neurological impairment and stroke.  CONCLUSION
Subclavian-carotid grafting is an effective alternative for carotid endarterectomy in patients with advanced atherosclerotic lesion of common and internal carotid arteries.
