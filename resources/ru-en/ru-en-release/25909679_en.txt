[The experience with the reconstruction of the superoposterior wall of the external auditory meatus during stapedoplasty].  The objective of the present study was to improve the effectiveness of stapedoplasty by developing the method for the prevention of the formation of retraction pockets in the tympanic membrane and cicatrical fixation of auditory ossicles.
A total of 60 patients presenting with grade I-II otosclerosis and conductive or mixed-type hearing impairment were surgically treated during the period from 2008 to 2014.
Twenty four of these patients had undergone stapedoplasty in the preceding period in different clinics that either failed to improve their conditions or resulted in their deterioration.
A new method was proposed for the reconstruction of the superoposterior wall of the auditory canal during stapedoplasty that consists of the replacement of the removed fragment by the last 150-200 mcm ultrathin allocartilaginous plate.
This plate prevented the subsequent retraction of the superoposterior portions of the tympanic membrane and its fusion with either the long process of the anvil bone or the prosthetic ring.
The method of this operation is described.
The analysis of long-term results of the treatment confirmed the high effectiveness of the proposed approach.
