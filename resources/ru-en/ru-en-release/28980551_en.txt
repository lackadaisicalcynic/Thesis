[The peculiar features of the distribution of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl- (1-hydroxycyclopentyl) (phenyl) acetate in the organism of warm-blooded animals after its intravenous administration].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the dynamics of the distribution of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl-(1-hydroxycyclopentyl)(phenyl) acetate in the organism of warm-blooded animals (rats) after its intravenous administration to the animals.
The identification and the quantitative determination of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl-(1-hydroxycyclopentyl)(phenyl) acetate present in the organs and blood of the warm-blooded animals were carried out with the use of chromatography in a thin layer of silica gel, chromogenic reaction for the synthesis of the acinitro salt, UV spectrophotometry, and gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GCh-MS).  The quantitation was performed on days 5, 20, 150, and 360 minutes after the intravenous administration of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl-(1-hydroxycyclopentyl)(phenyl) acetate to the rats.
The maximum amounts of cyclopentolate were found in the spleen, brain, lungs, and heart of the experimental animals.
