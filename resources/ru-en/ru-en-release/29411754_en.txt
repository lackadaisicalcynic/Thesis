[The new 2017 European society of cardiology (ESC) guidelines: important changes for introduction into clinical practice].
The paper gives an overview of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines updated in 2017.  The revised and amended guidelines for areas, such as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT), treatment of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and management of patients with valvular heart disease and peripheral artery disease, were presented in late summer of this year.
The authors of this paper present an independent analysis and discussion of new data on the key issues of diagnosis and treatment in patients in the above areas.
The recommendations on DAT pay special attention to the timing of the therapy and to the choice of its drugs.
The updated data on the treatment of patients with STEMI accurately determine the time to percutaneous coronary interventions, approaches to revascularization; the updates touch upon fibrinolytic therapy and new approaches to lipid-lowering therapy too.
Recommendations for the management of patients with peripheral artery atherosclerosis propose for the first time a section devoted to the choice of antiplatelet therapy (an antiaggregant and/or an anticoagulant) depending on the clinical situation.
