[Efficiency of combined methods of hemorroid treatment using hal-rar and laser destruction].  AIM
To develop the combined method of treatment of hemorrhoids with arterial ligation under Doppler control and laser destruction of internal and external hemorrhoids.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included 100 patients with chronic hemorrhoids stage II and III. Combined method of HAL-laser was used in study group, HAL RAR-technique in control group 1 and closed hemorrhoidectomy with linear stapler in control group 2.
Ð¡omparative evaluation of results in both groups was performed.
RESULTS
Combined method overcomes the drawbacks of traditional surgical treatment and limitations in external components elimination which are inherent for HAL-RAR.
Moreover, it has a higher efficiency in treating of hemorrhoids stage II-III compared with HAL-RAR and is equally safe and well tolerable for patients.  This method does not increase the risk of recurrence, reduces incidence of complications and time of disability.
