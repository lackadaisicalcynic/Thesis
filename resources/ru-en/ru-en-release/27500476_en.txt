[The peculiar features of conducting comprehensive expertises of the injuries inflicted inside the passenger car compartment].
The present article deals with the problem of forensic medical diagnostics of the injuries inflicted inside the passenger car compartment during motor vehicle accidents.
The authors place special emphasis on the fact of a significant increase in the number of road traffic accidents (RTA) with such consequences throughout the world.  The modern automobile industry pays much attention to the enhancement of the car safety features by significantly improving the design of passenger compartments.
It accounts for a change in the traditional character of the injuries to both the driver and the passengers resulting from motor vehicle accidents.
This, in turn, creates difficulties for the forensic medical experts as regards personality identification of the subjects who happened to be inside the car at the moment of the collision especially in the case of unascertainable circumstances of the accident and/or the involvement of several victims.
The authors describe peculiarities of the injuries inflicted inside the passenger car compartment during road traffic accidents including such that result from bringing the driver and the passengers closer to the construction elements of the car (stage I), their direct contact with these elements (stage II), and subsequent displacement (stage III).
