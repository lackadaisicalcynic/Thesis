[Postural control characteristics in elderly women with fallers].  Using computer posturografic (stabilometric) complex a study of postural control peculiarities was carried out in 108 women aged 65-74 years who had experienced two or more falls during the year (fallers).
These tests were: Sensory Organization Test, Motor Control Test, Rhythmic Weight Shift.
It was found that elderly women with fallers had a decrease of sensory information
(somatosensory - by 1,8 %, of the visual - by 6 %, and of the vestibular - by 10,1 %), the neurophysiological mechanisms of postural control (by 5,7 points), violation of adaptation possibilities of sensory and motor components of the legs to respond quickly to changes in the center of gravity within the support base of its footing (7,3 ms), as well as reducing balance control in the frontal
(by 7,2 %) and sagittal (by 23,2 % ) planes compared with the women of the same age without fallers.
