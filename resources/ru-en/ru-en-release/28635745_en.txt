Molecular genetics and pharmacogenetic approaches].  Genetic risk of binge eating disorder (ВЕD) is a consequence of joint participation of many genes, the contribution of each one is small, but the total (additive) effect is significant and greatly influences the age at onset, clinical dynamics and the level of treatment resistance.
It is assumed that the carriers of different polymorphic variants of genes and their combinations have different levels of genetic risk.
No Genom Wide Association studies of ВЕD has been performed and the analysis of the results of candidate genes studies gives reason to believe that pathogenetically substantiated panel of genes, including serotonin system, BDNF and, especially dopamine and endogenous opioid system, would be most useful, taking into account the mechanism of action of drugs for the ВЕD treatment.  Genetic studies with this panel if using evidence-based design, detailed and quantitative analysis of the family history of binge eating can give good results for: 1) assessment of the genetic risk of ВЕD for primary prevention programs; 2) identification of the specific clinical forms of development and course of ВЕD with significant genetic influence; 3) identification of the specific genetic variants that increase the effectiveness of personalized pharmacotherapy of ВЕD within pharmacogenetic approach.
