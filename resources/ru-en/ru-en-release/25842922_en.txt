[Comparative study of the determination of the HER2 status in gastric cancer in the biopsy and intraoperative specimens].
OBJECTIVE
To determine the HER2 status of gastric adenocarcinomas, by using biopsy and intraoperative specimens.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were used to examine the HER2 status of 346 gastric cancer biopsy and intraoperative specimens.  RESULTS
The study conducted on a large Russian sample of 346 patients showed a positive HER2 status in 10.7% of the examined specimens.
Intestinal-type adenocarcinomas exhibited a positive HER2 status in 21.4% of the cases.  Comparative analysis of the HER2 status in the biopsy and intraoperative specimens indicated that there were differences in the determination of the tumor HER2 status in less than 1% of the examined specimens.
The remaining found differences (14.7%) failed to change the tumor HER2 status and to affect the choice of a treatment regimen.
CONCLUSION
The performed investigation has demonstrated that the tumor HER2 status determined in the biopsy specimen significantly reflects the molecular biological properties of gastric cancer and may be clinically used to determine indications for the use of targeted drugs.
