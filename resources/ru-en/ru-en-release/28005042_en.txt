[Depression and epilepsy: comorbidities, pathogenesis, principles of therapy].
Numerous trials of last years confirm the bilateral link between depression and epilepsy with mutual complication of both diseases.
Depression increases the risk of the first unprovoked paroxysm, worsens the compliance of epileptic patients, leads to decrease of the response both to therapeutic and surgical treatment and to increase of side effects of antiepileptic drugs.
Depression is associated with high risk of suicidal behavior and reduces the quality of life level.
Depression in epileptic patients is characterized by atypical clinical course in most cases what makes its diagnostics difficult and becomes the reason of the absence of the necessary pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatment.  All of the above creates significant economical burden for the community because the epileptic patient with comorbid depression visits the physicians 2-4 times more often.
