[The influence of the main components of the ultraphonophoresis phytocomplex method on the release of the biologically active substances (an experimental study)].  The present study was designed to investigate kinetics of flavonoidrelease from the working compositions containing a phytocomplex.  The basic parameters of this processes during phonophoresis were determined in the model in vitro experiments.  The study has demonstrated the dependence of the flavonoid release rate on their initial concentration in the working compositions and the influence of dimethylsulfoxide (as well as the main and auxiliary agents of the working composition) on the release of biologically active substances.
The technological methods designed for the enhancement of the effectiveness of the phytocomplex phonophoresis technique are proposed.
