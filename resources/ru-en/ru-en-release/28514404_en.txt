[Emotional impairments and their correction in patients with migraine].
AIM  To study emotional impairments in patients with migraine and to evaluate the efficiency of Noophen therapy for this pathology.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
63 patients aged 18 to 45 years with migraine without aura were examined.
56 patients used prophylactic antimigraine therapy: Group 1 (n = 26) received metoprolol and Group 2 took metoprolol in combination with Noophen.
RESULTS
The patients with migraine had a significantly higher level of alexithymia than the controls.
Concomitant anxiety disorders were found in 47 (74.6%) cases.
The study provided evidence that the treatment was highly effective in Group 2 that exhibited a more pronounced decrease in pain intensity, a greater reduction in the levels of anxiety, and more vital activity.
CONCLUSION
The results of this study allow a conclusion that emotional impairments are implicated in the pathogenesis and clinical presentations of migraine and that it is appropriate to use Noophen for the treatment of this pathology.
