[Correction of blood microcirculation parameters and endothelial function in chronic venous insufficiency of lower limbs].
The authors assessed efficacy of the phlebotonic agent Venarus in treatment of patients presenting with chronic venous insufficiency of the lower extremities.
The study included a total of 34 patients with various degree of chronic venous insufficiency according to the CEAP classification.  Before the beginning of the study and on the background of treatment with Venarus we assessed the parameters of blood microcirculation by means of digital capillaroscopy of the nail bed of the fingers and toes, as well as determined the indices of arterial stiffness and endothelial function.
All patients on the background of treatment demonstrated a decrease in the degree of symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency.
A group of patients was revealed in whom treatment with Venarus turned out to be most effective: patients with initial perivascular oedema (an increase in the linear size of the perivascular zones) and a decrease in the mean velocity of capillary blood flow.
On the background of treatment with Venarus they were found to have a decrease in perivascular oedema, an increase in the mean velocity of capillary blood flow, and improvement of endothelial function.
