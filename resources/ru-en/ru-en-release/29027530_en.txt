[Automatic morphometric analysis as a method for determining the level of extracellular matrix components and for quantifying nuclear antigens].
Automated image analysis methods are highly important for biotechnology research.  The authors developed and tested a program for the morphometric analysis of photomicrographs of the sections processed using the standard immunohistochemical examination protocols.
The color deconvolution method used in the algorithm was proven to be effective in mapping the distribution of DAB chromogen in the sample containing multiple dyes.
The experiment demonstrated that the level of extracellular matrix proteins could be comparatively quantified in different groups of samples.
The effective methods for the quantitative analysis of the Ki-67 labelling index were also tested using the same algorithms.
The developed program was published under free GPL 3.0.
