[Age-related changes in the content of serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) in human dermis.]  The aim of our work was to examine content of serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) in human dermis at different ages (from 20 weeks of pregnancy to 85 years old).
SRPK1, proliferating cells nuclear antigen  (PCNA ), endothelial marker CD31 were detected in sections of the skin by indirect immunohistochemistry.
Results showed, that content of SRPK1 in dermal fibroblasts was increased form antenatal period to 20 years of life followed by a decrease until 61-85 years period.
SRPK1 content in dermal blood vessels is slowly gradually increased from antenatal period to 61-85 age interval.
The number of fibroblasts and their proliferative activity, the number of CD31 positive blood vessels in dermis were decreased from antenatal period to 61-85 years period of life.
Age-dependent decrease in SRPK1 in dermal fibroblasts from 20 years is associated with a reduction in the number and proliferative activity of fibroblasts.
Age-related increase in SRPK1 content in dermal blood vessels is associated with a diminishing of the number of blood vessels.
Hence, it can be supposed that SRPK1 has different actions on proliferation of differ components of dermis during aging.
