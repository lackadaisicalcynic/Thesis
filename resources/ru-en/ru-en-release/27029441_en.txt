OBJECTIVE  To compare clinical characteristics in children with enterovirus infections (EVI) and meningitis with detailed characteristics of the changes in the content of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) confirmed in the laboratory.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of examinations of 97 children, aged from 2.5 to 15 years, 3 adolescents and 1 adult female patient with EVI were analyzed.
Enterovirus RNA isolation and detection in feces and CSF was performed using PCR.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Enterovirus RNA in CSF was detected in 44 children, including 3 patients with cytosis (5-7-19 cells in 3 mm3).
The frequency and severity of symptoms in 42 patients with EVI and meningitis, 14 children with EVI without meningitis and 8 patients with ICD-10 «Meningitis unspecified» are presented.
The initial CSF pleocytosis in 1-3 day (4-5 day for two-wave course) in EVI and meningitis was <100 in 4, from 100 to 1000 in 33, >1000 (max 3036) cells in 3 mm3 in 5 patients, including 15 with the predominance of neutrophils (from 77 to 97% in cytosis 114-2300 cells in 3 mm(3)).
In the peripheral blood, leukocytosis 10.9-13.8×10(9)/л was noted in 12 children and leukocytosis 14.4-18.7×10(9)/л with the «left shift» in 7.
Most of the children (n=37) with EVI and meningitis were discharged from the hospital within 10-17 days.
The authors suggest the importance of including the variety of clinical presentations of EVI in the additional item «B10 Enterovirus infections» in upcoming ICD-11.
