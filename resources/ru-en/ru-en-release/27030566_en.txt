[The comprehensive pathogenetic approach to the neuro-orthopedic rehabilitation of the children of different age presenting with cerebral palsy].  OBJECTIVES
The present study was aimed at the improvement of comprehensive neuro-orthopedic rehabilitation of the children of different age presenting with cerebral palsy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 267 patients with infantile cerebral paralysis at the age from 1 year to 16 years were available for the observation including 158 (59.2%) boys and 109 (40.8%) girls.
RESULTS
The orthopedic treatment of locomotor disorders was adjusted for the patients' age, the neuropsychiatric status, and the type of autonomous dysfunction.
The conservative treatment was given 104 (39%) patients and the surgical intervention performed on 163 (61%) ones.
Vegetative disbalance was the predominant condition in the children aged up to 3 years.
Orthopedic alignment of the muscle tone was one of the most common methods of the treatment.
We used milestone plaster bandages for immobilization followed by wearing the orthoses and orthopedic shoes in combination with massage and therapeutic physical exercises.
The surgical treatment aimed at the normalization of the musculo-ligamentous apparatus was the predominant strategy for the age group of 4-7 years.  The conservative treatment was most frequently prescribed for the correction of vegetative dystonia.
The physiotherapeutic methods were applied differentially.  In the groups of children aged from 8 to 12 years and from 13 to 15 years, the surgical correction was aimed at the elimination of gross deformities.
The differentiated treatment and the use of different types of equipment proved highly efficient for the elimination of muscle spasticity and hypotrophy as well as for the correction of corporal deformities.  Moreover, it helped to restore and improve the motor ability.
The children's physical development and mental capacity have also been stimulated.
