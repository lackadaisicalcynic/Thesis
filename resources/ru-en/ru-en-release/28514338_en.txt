[A comparative chemoreactome analysis of mexidol].
AIM  To compare mexidol with control molecules (choline alfoscerate, piracetam, glycine, semax) using chemoreactome analysis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The chemical structure of mexidol was compared to molecule metabolites extracted from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and a drug database.  More than 40 000 of metabolites from HMDB were used as a model of human metabolome.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The chemoreactome analysis showed that mexidol may be (1) an agonist of acetylcholine and GABA-A receptors; (2) an anti-inflammatory agent, the effects of which are carried out by inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins; (3) a neurotrophic agent with neuroprotective properties; (4) a coagulation inhibitor; (5) a diabetes medication and (6) a hypolipidemic agent.
Compared to 'control' molecules, mexidol has a more pronounced safety profile (a lower impact on serotonin, dopamine and adrenergic receptors, a lesser degree of interaction with the potassium channels of the heart, MAO and P450 cytochromes).
The results of modeling allow to specify the mechanisms of action of mexidol at the molecular level.
