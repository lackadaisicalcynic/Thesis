[Heidelberg retinal tomography of the optic disc in the early diagnosis of glaucoma].  AIM
To analyze anatomical and topographic optic disc parameters with account to the disc area in glaucoma suspects.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 302 patients (408 eyes) aged 25 to 76 years (the mean age of 50.5Â±12.5 years); men and women roughly equal in number.
The eyes were divided into 8 groups depending on the disc area, which ranged from 0.89 to 3.5 mm2.
With HRT, 11 global and sector optic disc parameters were examined, 4 of which (disc area, rim area, cup/disc ratio, mean RNFL thickness) are presented in this paper.
RESULTS
The study revealed a great variability of disc area values as well as individual morphometric features of the examined optic discs.
We have also established high statistical significance of the difference between the above-listed optic disc parameters, both global and sectoral, in groups with different disc areas with the exception of the mean RNFL thickness.
CONCLUSION
For early glaucoma detection with HRT, it is advisable to consider the individual area-dependent anatomical and topographic features of the optic disc.
