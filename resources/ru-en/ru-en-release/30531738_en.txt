[Effectiveness of various approaches for acute malignant colonic obstruction].
AIM
To determine optimal treatment strategy for acute malignant colonic obstruction.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
349 patients with acute malignant colonic obstruction were retrospectively analyzed for the period 2005-2017.
All patients were divided into two groups depending on surgical approach.  Surgical group comprised 259 patients, endoscopic group - 90 patients.
Both groups were comparable by gender, age, level of intestinal obstruction and duration of the disease.  However, morbidity and mortality rate were significantly different.
RESULTS
In surgical group incidence of complications was 63.3%, mortality - 19.7%.  In group of endoscopic stenting the same values were 8.9% and 6.7%, respectively.
Significant differences of morbidity and mortality were observed between groups (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION
Endoscopic stenting should be preferred over surgery to eliminate colonic obstruction in patients with acute malignant ileus.
