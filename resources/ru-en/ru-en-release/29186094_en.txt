[Pectoral-retroauricular approach for endoscopic parathyroidectomy (experimental study)].
AIM  To develop and investigate in the experiment the method of endoscopic parathyroidectomy in order to prevent intraoperative 'conflict of the instruments' and to reduce surgical trauma via extracervical approach.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of 10 experimental endoscopic parathyroidectomies with original pectoral-retroauricular approach were analyzed.  RESULTS
Mean time of surgery was 77.8±10.2 minutes (65-97), mean time of surgical exposure - 50.3±6.7 minutes (41-59).
Visualization and identification of parathyroid glands were achieved in 100% of cases.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve was preserved in 100% of cases.
CONCLUSION
Original endoscopic pectoral-retroauricular approach for parathyroidectomy is methodologically and technically justified and can be recommended for clinical application.
