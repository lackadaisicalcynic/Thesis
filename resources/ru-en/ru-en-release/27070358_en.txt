[Capabilities of positron emission tomography to study mecha-nisms of multiple sclerosis: own data and literature].  The article presents the literature data and results of our own researchon the use of positron emission tomography (PET) with different radiotracersin multiple sclerosis (MS).
Informationon the operating principles of PET and PET studies with different radiotracers are considered.
The results of PET studiesin different typesof MS, including determinationof the localization of neuronal damagein the corticalgray matter, assessmentof microglial activation, study of the relationship between glucose metabolismin the brain and the severity of cognitive impairmentin MS, can providenew information about the pathogenesis ofMS.
