[Endothelial dysfunction in chronic vascular encephalopathy].  In this review, the authors consider endothelial dysfunction as a key pathophysiologic event of chronic vascular encephalopathy.
Possible mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction in chronic vascular encephalopathy, especially associated with cerebral small vessel disease, neuroanatomy and pathophysiology of cerebral vascular endothelium are considered.
Laboratory and instrumental methods for the diagnosis of endothelial dysfunction and potential approaches to its correction are described.
