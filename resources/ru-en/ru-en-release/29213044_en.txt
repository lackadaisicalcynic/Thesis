[The course and development of epilepsy in patients with typical variant of Rett syndrome and mutations].  AIM
To study the anamnesis, clinical state, electro-encephalographic and brain MRI characteristics in patients with Rett syndrome (МЕСР2) and epilepsy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eleven female patients, aged from 3 to 23 years, with Rett syndrome and MeCP2 mutations were studied.
The study continued for 10 years (2006-2015).  Assessment of neurological and mental status, night sleep video-EEG monitoring, MRI were performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Epilepsy was diagnosed in six cases (54.5%).
Mean age at onset of epileptic seizures was 3 years 9 month.
The following types of seizures were described: generalized, myoclonic, myotonic, tonic, versive, focal motor, atypical absences.
Status epilepticus developed in one patient.
Generalized seizures were identified in 56.25%, focal seizures in 43.75%.
EEG changes were found in 9 patients (81.8%): slowing of the activity, episodes of periodic regional slowing, regional epileptiform activity and diffuse epileptiform activity, benign focal epileptiform discharges (BFED) of childhood, multiregional epileptiform activity.
Five patients were treated with antiepileptic drugs.
All of them had improved during treatment: a reduction of frequency of seizures was up to 50% in 4 cases (80%).
One patient with resistant epilepsy was treated with the combination of drugs (levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, benzodiazepine) that led to stopping of seizures during night sleep and decrease in the frequency of daytime seizures by 50%.
Further research of epilepsy and efficacy of antiepileptic drugs in Rett syndrome is required.
