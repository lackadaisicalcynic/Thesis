[Modern diagnosis and postoperative monitoring of acromegaly patients at a neurosurgical clinic].
Acromegaly is a severe disease associated with chronic overproduction of the growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is caused in most cases by pituitary adenoma.
The main causes of mortality in acromegaly are cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and cancers.  At present, the most effective treatment for acromegaly is surgical pituitary adenomectomy.
Complete resection of pituitary tumors leads to the normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels, regression of symptoms, and a reduction in the risk of death.  The article discusses the current criteria for diagnosis and remission of acromegaly after surgical adenomectomy as well as postoperative monitoring issues aligned with the recent guidelines of the Russian and international endocrinology associations.
