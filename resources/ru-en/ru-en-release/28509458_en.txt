[Melatonin in a woman's life: from birth to menopause].  We did a review of the literature data of main Russian publications and databases PubMed/Medline for the last 7 years.
In the present article we examine the physiology of secretion of pineal hormone melatonin and its role in the vital processes of the body.
The study was focused on the influence of melatonin on the female reproductive system, participation in the aging process and the formation of pathological menopause.
The article presents research data on the effectiveness of the drug melatonin in the climacteric syndrome.
It is revealed that up to the present time according to the literature data there is no information about the standards of secretion of melatonin for women of different age groups, and the lack of secretion of melatonin can be judged by clinical manifestations, and also when compared with groups of healthy women.
Remain unclear issues in the application of drugs melatonin at various complications of pregnancy and gynecological diseases.  Long-term use of melatonin is still open in climacteric syndrome.
