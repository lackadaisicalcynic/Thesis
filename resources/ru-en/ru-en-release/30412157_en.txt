[Diagnosis and interventional treatment of pain syndromes after surgery for degenerative lumbar spine diseases].  Postoperative pain accompanies up to 20% of interventions for degenerative spine diseases (DSDs).
The epidemiologic data are contradictory; clinical and radiological diagnostics is often low efficient; capabilities of interventional diagnosis and treatment techniques are poorly understood.  PURPOSE
The study purpose was to investigate the structure of pain syndromes after surgery for DSDs of the lumbar spine, based on complex diagnostics, as well as to evaluate the capabilities of interventional treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 310 patients with postoperative pain syndromes.
Patients with obvious indications for repeated surgery were excluded from the analysis; the remaining patients underwent selective diagnostic blockades followed by interventional (puncture) treatment.
A positive outcome was defined as a reduction in pain by 50% on the numerical rating scale (NRS-11), by 20% in the Oswestry index (ODI), and by 8 points in the sciatica bothersomeness index (SBI), with the effect lasting for 12 months.
Predictive factors for the risk of pain syndromes were analyzed.  RESULTS
Out of 310 patients, 162 (52.6%) patients had no obvious indications for surgery.
Radicular pain was detected in 56 (18.6%) of 310 patients; the positive treatment outcome was achieved in 38 (67.86%) of 56 patients.  Facet pain was present in 29 (9.35%) patients; the positive treatment outcome was achieved in 23 (79.31%) patients.
Discogenic pain was found in 12 (3.87%) patients; the positive treatment outcome was achieved in 5 (41.63%) patients. sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain was present in 42 (13.55%) patients; the positive treatment outcome was achieved in 36 (85.71%) patients.
Myofascial and competing pain was detected in 12 (3.87%) patients; the causes were not identified in 11 (3.55%) cases.  The main risk factors were sagittal balance parameters.
CONCLUSION
Complex diagnostics revealed postoperative pain not associated with surgical causes in 52.6% of cases; the origin of pain was identified in 49.95% of cases.
Interventional treatment was effective in 64.81% of cases; failed back surgery syndrome was diagnosed in 16.13% of patients.
