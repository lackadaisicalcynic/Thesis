[Choroidal nevi: clinical features].  UNLABELLED
The prevalence of choroidal nevi (CN) ranges from 1% to 10%.
It may be hard to differentiate a small melanoma from an atypical ("malignatized") CN, which occupies an intermediate position between typical nevi and actual melanomas and can be referred to as "progressive" or "suspicious".
The risk of malignant transformation of a CN ranges from 0.78% to 7%, thus necessitating the need for a detailed description of its clinical features.
OBJECTIVE  To study clinical features of choroidal nevi in conjunction with their growth patterns.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 80 patients (84 eyes) with choroidal nevi were studied, including 23 men and 57 women aged 65.33Â±3.26 years on average.
The follow-up period was 12-48 months.
In 26 cases (30.95%) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was also present.
RESULTS
Choroidal nevus is generally more common in women (71.25%).
The right eye was involved in 36 cases, the left--in 48.
Bilateral CN was diagnosed in 5% of cases.
The follow-up period was 12-48 months.
The nevi were mostly located in the juxtapapillary (11.9%) and macular (29.76%) regions.
In 10 eyes they spread to the parafovea and foveola.
The shape was typically round (73.8%), in the rest of cases--oval (26.2%).
The size at presentation varied from 1 mm to 9 mm (2.93 mm on average).
Diagnostic features of a stationary nevus (does not require a follow-up) have been identified.
Nevus enlargement and changes in the overlying retina are indicative of progression.
CONCLUSION
On the basis of clinical presentation all choroidal nevi can be classified as either stationary or progressing.
If progression is suspected, a close follow-up is required.
Progressive destruction of the overlying retina and early signs of visual impairment are risk factors for melanoma development.
