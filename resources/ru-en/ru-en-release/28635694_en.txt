[Improvement of visual functions after successful microsurgical exclusion of a giant aneurysm of the right internal carotid artery using revascularization techniques].
We describe a clinical case of successful treatment of a female patient with a giant paraclinoid aneurysm of the right ICA.
The aneurysm had a pseudotumoral course and manifested as pronounced progressive visual impairments.  The patient underwent microsurgery including trapping/clipping of the right ICA aneurysm after creation of an EICMA and a high-flow anastomosis between the ECA and the M2 segment of the MCA.
The surgery enabled decompression of the optic nerves, avoiding their injury.
Postoperatively, the patient underwent transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the optic nerves.  The case feature was that the patient developed gradual restoration of the blind eye vision.
