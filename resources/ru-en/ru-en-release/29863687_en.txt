[Neurological semiotics of benign craniofacial tumors].
AIM  To identify the most frequently occurring symptoms resulting from the affection of internal and external skull base in patients with benign tumors of the anterior and middle cranial base.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The authors analyzed a complex of history, clinical, and instrumental data as well as results of combined treatment of 642 patients with benign tumors of the anterior and middle cranial base operated Medical Research between 2007 and 2011.
RESULTS
Neurological signs and symptoms in patients with benign tumors of the anterior cranial base, parasellar region, and middle cranial fossa were studied.  In the majority of cases, the tumor extended extracranially.
The most common groups of symptoms were identified and described, the most important groups are presented in the diagrams.
The proposed scheme is applicable also for malignant tumors or other mass lesions of the same localization.
CONCLUSION  Effective treatment and selection of the best management of a patient depends on modern medical approaches and techniques including neuroimaging.
Careful assessment of symptoms is crucial in detection of tumors in the early stage.  Dynamic monitoring of the patient using the proposed scheme will contribute to early detection of tumor recurrence or progression.
