[Antidepressant effect of 3-oxypyridine and succinic acid derivatives (experimental study)].
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate antidepressant activity of domestic derivatives of 3-oxypyridine and succinic acid (emoxipine, reamberin and mexidol) in rats.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The influence of emoxipine, reamberin and mexidol on duration of desperate behavior of rats in Porsolt forced swim test was studied.
Additionally the effect of these substances on the animal's behavior in the open field was evaluated.
Amitriptyline and alpha-lipoic acid were used as reference substances.
RESULTS  It was established that three administrations of any of the substances in doses corresponding to the therapeutic range in humans reduced the duration of desperate behavior in Porsolt test.
Such effect of emoxipine, reamberin, mexidol and alpha-lipoic acid is indicative of their antidepressant activity.  Intensity of this activity depends on the effect of these substances on the behavior in the open field.
CONCLUSION  Reamberin and alpha-lipoic acid that in maximal doses either had no effect on the orientation behavior in the open field (reamberin) or suppressed it (alpha-lipoic acid) matched amitriptyline in the extent of antidepressant activity.
The derivatives of 3-oxypyridine (emoxipine and mexidol) with stimulatory effect on the behavior in the open field demonstrated significantly lower ability to reduce desperate behavior than that of amitriptyline.
