[Alcohol use disorders: current approaches to diagnosis and treatment].
Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are the leading causes of disability, health worsening and increased mortality.  Diagnosis of alcohol use disorders is based on the formal criteria of ICD-10 and DSM-V. Sobriety-oriented therapy has extremely low efficiency.
The difficulties of therapy are compounded by the fact that less than 10% patients with alcohol use disorder participate in treatment programs.
Serious expectations in addressing unsatisfactory efficiency of alcoholism treatment are associated with WHO reducing alcohol consumption strategy.
Nalmefene is the first and still only drug registered as a medicine for reducing alcohol use.  Recent studies show that the decrease of alcohol consumption using nalmefene creates opportunities for significant lessening of alcohol-related morbidity, injuries and deaths.
