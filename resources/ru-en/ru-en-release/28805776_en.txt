[Diagnostic and curative bronchoscopy for purulent-destructive pulmonary diseases].
AIM
To assess an efficacy of diagnostic and curative bronchoscopy in patients with purulent-destructive pulmonary diseases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Diagnosis and treatment of 34 patients with purulent-destructive pulmonary diseases including small-focal destruction (14) and lung abscesses (19) were analyzed.
33 patients underwent diagnostic fibrobronchoscopy (FBS) with brush and transbronchial biopsy.
Curative endoscopy included bronchial tree sanation, peribronchial administration of antibiotics (5) and transbronchial drainage of abscess (14).
RESULTS
Atrophic bronchitis and cicatricial deformity of the 2-3rd segmental bronchi were revealed in 81.8% and 15.2% respectively.
Transbronchial biopsy confirmed malignant neoplasms (15.2%) and pulmonary tuberculosis (6.1%).
Peribronchial administration of amikacin in patients with small-focal pulmonary destruction and transbronchial drainage of abscesses accelerated pulmonary tissue repair and complete recovery.
CONCLUSION
Transbronchial biopsy in patients with destructive pulmonary diseases verifies pathological process and excludes malignant and specific pulmonary damage.
Complex use of endoscopic methods is associated with positive clinical result in all patients with pulmonary destruction.
