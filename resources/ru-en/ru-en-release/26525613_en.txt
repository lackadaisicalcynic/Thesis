OBJECTIVE  To study neuropsychological characteristics of perception processes, recognition and differentiation of emotional distress in post stroke patients with regard to localization of ischemic lesion.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 47 post stroke patients with right-hemisphere and left hemisphere localization of ischemic stroke in the early stage of hospitalization.  The Subjective Feelings Scale and a battery of neuropsychological tests were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  In patients with right-hemisphere localization of the lesion, positive emotional reactions were more frequent, neuropsychological implementation level was realized through details and differentiation of the image.
In patients with left-hemispheric localization of ischemic stroke, negative emotional reactions were dominated and neuropsychological implementation level was realized through a vague and undifferentiated way.
