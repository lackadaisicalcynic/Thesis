[Prevention of paracolostomic hernia].
AIM  To improve the prevention of paracolostomic hernias.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We studied the prevention of paracolostomic hernia using mesh allograft.
The study involved 73 patients with low-ampullary rectal cancer.
Open or laparoscopic abdominoperineal extirpation of rectum was performed in all observations.
21 patients underwent prophylactic Sugarbaker's repair of paracolostomic area.
We used the modifications of this surgical stage for transabdominal and retroperitoneal stoma.
RESULTS
There were no postoperative complications associated with the use of allograft.
The hernia occurred in one case (4.8%) of prevention group and in 14 (26.9%) patients of control group.
CONCLUSION
The first results of composite allograft application to prevent paracolostomic hernias are encouraging.
The absence of specific complications and favorable long-term results allow to continue the investigation.
