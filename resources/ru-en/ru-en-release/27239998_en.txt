[Laboratory evaluation of retraction cords properties].
The aim of the study was the investigation of the effect of two factors on the diameter changings of different types of retraction cords.
Using an optical microscope MBS-10 (x10) the diameter of the different retraction cords was measured.
The measurement also was performed after tension and after wetting cords with distilled water.  The cords diameter decreased after their tension and increased after wetting.
The degree of diameter changes depends on the kind of cords weaving.  Braided cords "00" and "1" sizes diameter after it tension decreased at 31% and 37%, knitted cords under tension changed the diameter at 53% and 48%, correspondingly.
Cords features after wetting also varied.
Wetting of the braided cords with distilled water did not lead to significant diameter changes while wetting of knitted cords increases their diameter at 13% (00) and 15% (1).
