[Clinical and stabilometric restructuring of patients stability during balance therapy from the first days of ischemic stroke].  AIM
To study the process of recovery of postural function during stabilometric training with biofeedback (BFB) in patients with ischemic carotid stroke.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty-two patients underwent 10-day stabilometric training from the onset of stroke.  Clinical and stabilometric parameters were assessed at 4 points: at baseline, after 5 sessions, after 10 sessions and after 3-4 months in the early recovery stage after discharge from the hospital.
RESULTS
There was no correlation between the positive regress of neurologic symptoms and trends of stabilometry indicators.
The latter were deteriorated in the very acute and acute stages (in case of positive clinical dynamics) compared to normative indicators, a trend toward normalization appeared in the early recovery period that reflects the reorganization of postural mechanisms and formation of a new model of balance control.
CONCLUSION
Stabilometric training decreased neurological deficit in the patients.  The remote effect of BFB-treatment was noted as well.
Stabilometric training in the very acute period was safe and effective in patients with mild to moderate stroke.
