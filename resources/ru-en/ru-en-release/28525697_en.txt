A total of 81 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) were enrolled in the study.
Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 - without postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) (59 patients, 74,6 % men, mean age 65,8±4 years), Group 2 - with early new-onset AF after CABG (22 patients, 90,9 % men, mean age of 67,7±5,4 years).
Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, superoxide dismutase (SOD), troponin I were studied.
During the observation period AF occurred in 27,2 % cases, an average of 4,9±3,8 days after surgery.
In the postoperative period were significantly higher in group 2 left atrium (LA) (43,9±3,4 vs. 37,6±3,9 mm, p<0,001), IL-6 (72,7±60,8 vs. 38,0±34,6 pg/ml, p=0,04), IL-8 (11,9±6,0 vs. 7,7±5,4 pg/ml, p=0,01), SOD (2 462,0±2 029,3 vs. 1 515,0±1 292,9 units/g, p=0,04) when compared with group 1.
The multivariate analysis showed that the odds ratio for AF development in postoperative period for LA more than 39 mm was 2,1 (95 % CI 1,2-3,8, p=0,0004), IL-6 levels more than 65,18 pg/ml - 1,4 (95 % CI 1,1-2,7, p=0,009), IL-8 levels more than 9,67 pg/ml - 1,2 (95 % CI 1,1-3,7, p=0,009), SOD more than 2948 units/g -1,1 (95 % CI 1,01-2,9, p=0,04).  Our study showed that left atrium dimension, high interleukin-6, interleukin-8 and superoxide dismutase levels play an important role in development of atrial fibrillation in early postoperative period after coronary bypass graft surgery.
