[Acetylsalicylic acid for the prevention of primary myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke].  There is evidence that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is effective in preventing events in a number of cardiovascular diseases.
However, there is a number of unresolved problems concerning the efficiency and suitability of its use as an agent for the prevention of cardiovascular events (CVEs) (myocardial infarction (Ml) and/or ischemic stroke (IS) and/or death) in subjects without any clinical manifestations and/or diagnosed coronary heart disease (primary prevention of CVEs).
The aim of the review is to compare the current recommendations of, professional communities for the.use of ASA as an agent for the primary prevention of CVEs, to analyze cohort studies and meta-analyses that are not included in the above recommendations (2013-2014), and to consider particular issues on ASA administration (resistance to ASA; barriers to its preventive use).  The analysis performed suggests that there is no convincing evidence that it is reasonable to use ASA as a population-wide prevention strategy.
The studies and meta-analyses often show conflicting data, which is likely to be associated with the clinical features of population groups included in the studies, with the presence or absence of ASA resistance and motivation for therapy.  According to the current clinical recommendations, the results of studies and meta-analysis, and expert's opinions, deciding whether it is expedient to use ASA as an agent for the prevention of primary MI and/or IS and death from atherosclerostic vascular events should be based on the assessment of an individual's risks for the above disorders, which are related to a risk for hemorrhages due to ASA intake.
