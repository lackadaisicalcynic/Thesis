[Mono- and combination therapy with the mexidol in young patients with cerebral angiodystonia].
AIM  To evaluate an effect of mono- and combined therapy with mexidol in young patients with cerebral angiodystonia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ninety patients (38 men and 52 women, aged from 25 to 44 years) with autonomic dysfunction syndrome in the form of asthenoautonomic and cephalgic syndromes treated with mexidol (group 1, 30 patients), vinpocetine (group 2, 30 patients) and with the combination of these drugs (group 3, 30 patients) were included in the study.
Cerebral hemodynamics was assessed using the algorithm of complex ultrasound study, autonomic regulation with the analysis of heart rate variability, functional microcirculation with laser Doppler flowmetry before and 10 days after treatment.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Mexidol used both in mono- and combination therapies exerted autonomic stabilizing and cerebral protective effects in the treatment of cerebral angiodystonia.  The improvement of cerebral hemodynamics and microhemocirculation was shown.
When used in combination, mexidol and vinpocetine had the synergistic effect, moreover, the adaptation of cerebral circulation increased more rapidly compared to vinpocetine treatment.  Therefore, the combined therapy (mexidol and vinpocetine) in patients with cerebrovascular pathology minimizes the likelihood of poor outcomes and can prevent the development of acute cerebral circulation disorder.
