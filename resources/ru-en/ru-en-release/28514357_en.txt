[The results of universal audiological screening of newborn infants in the Astrakhan region].  We have evaluated the results of universal audiological screening of 93 352 newborn infants performed in the Astrakhan region of the Russian Federation during the period from 2009 till 2015.
The screening coverage amounted to 95%.
The prevalence of hearing disorders was estimated at 1:1111 and that of their severe forms at 1:3000.
The clinical significance of the examination during its first stage consists of the exclusion of evoked otoacoustic emission.
After the completion of the second stage, it is necessary to carry out the regular medical follow up observation of the children suffering from hearing impairment and to undertake the early rehabilitative treatment based on the application of hearing aids and prosthetic devices.
Sensorineural hearing loss was found to be the predominant form of hearing disorders in the children during the first year of life (80%).
The impairment of hearing was documented in 22.3% of the premature children which suggests the necessity of long-term monitoring of evoked otoacoustic emission in these patients.
