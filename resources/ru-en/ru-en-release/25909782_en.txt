[New biomarkers and drug targets for diagnosis and therapy of Alzheimer's disease (molecular determinants of zinc-dependent oligomerization of Β-amyloid)].  In view of the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the key molecular event is the structural transition of Β-amyloid from the physiologically normal monomer state to soluble neurotoxic oligomers accumulating in the form of insoluble extracellular aggregates (amyloid plaques) in brain tissues.
Zinc ions are known to play a crucial role in the formation of these pathological aggregates.
The authors and collaborators have identified that the certain chemical modification and point amino acid substitutions in the metal-binding domain play a critical role in the formation of neurotoxic zinc-dependent oligomers and induce the development of cerebral amyloidosis and other pathological processes characteristic of AD.  The results allow to use these forms of Β-amyloid as potential biomarkers of early diagnosis of AD.
Zinc-dependent dimerization and oligomerization of Β-amyloid can be used as drug target for treatment of AD.
