[Density of the endotheliocytic layer of the cornea of the eyeball as a function of age].  This article presents the results of measuring the number of corneal endotheliocytes in a unit area of descemet membrane surface in 546 volunteers of different ages.
The average values of the density of the corneal posterior epithelium for the age intervals 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80 years and older are shown, a constant decrease in the number of endotheliocyte cells as the number of years lived increases.
