[Forensic medical assessment of the cases of HIV infection and hemocontact viral hepatitis B and C during the period from 2011 till 2015 in different subjects of the Russian Federation].  The annually increasing number of the patients presenting with HIV infection and hemocontact viral hepatitis is naturally accompanied by the growing number of deaths from these infectious pathologies.
The objective of the present study was to analyze the results of forensic medical expertises of the cases of HIV infection and hemocontact viral hepatitis B and C during the period from 2011 till 2015 in different subjects of the Russian Federation.
The data obtained confirm the tendency toward the further rise in the frequency of such cases in the practical work of forensic medical experts.  Moreover, they indicate the necessity of registration of such cases in state forensic medical expertise organizations and open up the prospects for the development of the common approaches to the solution of the existing problems including the evaluation of the degree of the harm to human health.
