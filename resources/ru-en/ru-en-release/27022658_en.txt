[Unsolved problems of cytoprotective therapy in patients with coronary heart disease].  The paper gives data on the proven efficiency of myocardial cytoprotection with the pFOX inhibitors trimetazidine and meldonium for coronary heart disease.
However, no algorithm has been defined for their differentiated use at different ischemic remodeling stages in these patients in terms of the mechanism of metabolic effects.
Sequential use of meldonium and trimetazidine in different periods of acute and chronic myocardial ischemia may become one of the possible ways to increase the efficacy of the pFOX inhibitors.
