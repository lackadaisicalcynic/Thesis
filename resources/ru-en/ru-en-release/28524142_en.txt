[Effectiveness of epithelialization therapy after surgical treatment of pterygiu].
Pterygium is widely distributed in regions with hot and dry climate.  Frequent relapses of the disease are due to delayed epithelialization of postoperative corneal erosion, associated inflammation and formation of dry areas of the cornea.
Effective stimulation of corneal epithelium regeneration in the postoperative period could reduce the frequency of relapses.
AIM  to compare the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of different keratoprotectors in patients after surgical treatment of pterygium.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 60 patients (73 eyes) with pterygium were operated on using classic McReynolds technique.
Depending on the keratoprotector used postoperatively (Korneregel, Balarpan, or Stillavit), the patients were divided into three groups of 20 persons.
In each group, the clinical picture during the postoperative period was evaluated at days 1, 3, and 7.
RESULTS
As to the subjective symptoms relief and stimulation of epithelization, Stillavit capability was comparable to that of Korneregel, but Stillavit was free of the common side effect of Korneregel - blurred vision after instillation.
Epithelialization rate under Stillavit therapy was higher than that under Balarpan.
CONCLUSION
Stillavit can be recommended as the drug of choice for patients after surgical treatment of pterygium.
Components of the preparation (0.16% sodium hyaluronate, 0.05% sodium chondroitin sulfate, and 1% dexapanthenolum) act on each of the links in the pathogenesis of recurrent pterygium - slow epithelialization of the cornea, associated inflammation and formation of dry areas of the cornea.
