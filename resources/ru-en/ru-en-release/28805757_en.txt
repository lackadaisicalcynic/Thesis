[The influence of Cytoflavin therapy on the cerebral hemodynamics in patients with various stages of hypertensive disease].  AIM
To study an influence of cytoflavin therapy on the cerebral hemodynamics in patients with various stages of hypertensive disease (HD).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and forty patients with HD, I-III stages, were randomized into 2 groups: patients of group 1 received complex treatment (antihypertensive therapy and cytoflavin), patients of group 2 were treated with antihypertensive therapy.  The control group consisted of 30 healthy people.
The changes in cerebral hemodynamics using the algorithm of the complex ultrasound study of cerebral vascular system were assessed.  RESULTS
Disturbances of hemodynamics at all structural/functional levels of cerebral vascular system were found in all HD stages.  There were a decrease in the blood flow through the common carotid, inner carotid, spinal and middle cerebral arteries, reactivity of veins of Rosenthal, blood flow through veins of Rosenthal and inner jugular veins and an increase of blood flow through spinal veins.
The hemodynamic study showed that in group 1 there was the increase of blood flow through common carotid, inner carotid, middle cerebral arteries in stage I and through spinal arteries in stage I-II of HD; improvement of the reactivity of veins of Rosenthal, restoration of blood flow parameters through the veins of Rosenthal and inner jugular veins to control values, the decrease in blood flow velocity through the spinal veins in all HD stages.
CONCLUSION
HD is accompanied by the damage of all structural/functional levels of cerebral vascular system.
The use of cytoflavin in the complex therapy of HD exerts a positive influence on the cerebral hemodynamics reducing the severity of arterial insufficiency in the initial stages of disease, improving microcirculation and venous hemodynamics in all HD stages.
