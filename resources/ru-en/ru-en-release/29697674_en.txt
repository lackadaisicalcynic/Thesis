[Pulmonary larval paragonimiasis mimicking lung cancer].  Larval paragonimiasis is a parasitic disease caused by lung fluke larvae.
Unlike the classic form of paragonimiasis, the larval form occurs with a large number of clinical manifestations.
However, this fact only complicates the diagnosis of larval paragonimiasis, for the abundance of clinical manifestations results in the misdiagnosis of other diseases.
Another feature of this form of paragonimiasis is the tendency to generalize and mimic the clinical presentation of malignant neoplasms.  The performed diagnostic measures failed to give an accurate view of the nature of the disease, therefore diagnostic thoracoscopy was carried out and biopsy specimens were taken from the subpleural region of dissemination, followed by urgent histologic examination suggestive of glandular cancer.
This circumstance became the reason for atypical resection of the affected portion, which was done; however, the patient died from pulmonary thromboembolism on postoperative day 2.
The main diagnosis of chronic pulmonary generalized paragonimiasis (cystic and pneumosclerotic phases) with neoplastic syndrome was posthumously made.
