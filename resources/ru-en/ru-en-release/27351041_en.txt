[Intrauterine infections as a risk factor of the development of sensorineural impairment of hearing ].
Intrauterine infections are a crucial pathogenic factor exerting an appreciable influence on the development of the fetus.  They can provoke intrauterine death, cause multiple lesions in the organs and tissues as well as long-term complications that manifest themselves at the later stages of the growth and development of the child.
One of such complications is the sensorineural loss of hearing.
The importance of hearing impairment arises from the high prevalence of tis condition and frequent incapacitation it causes in the patients.
The present publication is focused on various mechanisms underlying the development of hearing impairment depending on the primary infection.  Special attention is given to the methods of diagnostics and treatment of intrauterine infections.
