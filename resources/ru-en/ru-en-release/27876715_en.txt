[Diagnostics of tooth supporting structures].
The aim of the study was to assess alveolar bone resorption in patients with periodontal disease and individuals with normal periodontal status and coordinate resorbtion rates with tooth mobility.
Tooth mobility was measured in 19 patients with periodontal disease and 17 healthy individuals by two-parametrical periodontometry in two different positions: in equilibrium and after pre-loading.  The level of bone resorption was determined by periodontal probe.
Previously unknown correlation between tooth mobility and alveolar bone resorption was found out meaning that bone atrophy can be determined by tooth mobility.
