[The rat submandibular lymph node after introduction in mandibular bone defect ultipotent mesenchymal cells adsorbed on polyhydroxyalkanoate scaffold].  The reactions of rat regional lymph nodes, caused by implantation of the autologous multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells of a bone marrow origin (AMMSCBM) for acceleration of bone defect regeneration in bottom jaw experiment were studied by methods of fluorescent light microscopy.
After introduction in an injury site of a bottom jaw bone of polyhydroxyalkanoate with adsorbed AMMSCBM with a transfected GFP gene the numerous large macrophages with a set of oval fluorescent inclusions in cytoplasm appear in lymph nodules of submandibular lymph nodes.
The number of such macrophages increases within 2 weeks after operation, and further starts decreasing.  Probably, entered via such way the AMMSCBM partially are phagocytized by macrophages.
At destruction of the structures created from AMMSCBM, debris also are phagocytized by macrophages.  In that and other case these macrophages appear in the germinative centers of lymph nodules in lymph nodes where initiation of immunity reactions against DNA and same GFP isnot excluded.
