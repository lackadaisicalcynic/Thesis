[Microbiocenosis of major biotopes of the oral cavity in patients with tongue carcinoma during complex treatment].  The composition of the microflora in three biotopes of the oral cavity was examined in 36 patients with tongue carcinoma before chemotherapy, one - two weeks after two courses of chemotherapy and before gemiglosseklomiya.
The oral dysbiosis was revealed in patients before antitumor therapy.  The opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria in concentration more than 4 lg CFU/cmÂ² were dominant in microbiocenosis of oral cavity.
Most of the isolated microorganisms were capable of maintaining the inflammatory process by secreting oral enzymes and toxins.
The microflora formed normobiocenosis in oral cavity after two courses of chemotherapy.
The pathogenic potential of selected microflora in patients after preoperative radiotherapy before surgery was more pronounced than the microflora of healthy people, and also in patients prior to treatment.
Dysbiosis of III degree was detected in oral cavity of patients with tongue carcinoma before gemiglosseklomiya. requiring correction for the prevention the postoperative complications.
