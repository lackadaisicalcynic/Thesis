[Schizophrenia spectrum disorders in general medical practice].  Based on the conception of correlations between independent endogenous factors (positive and negative disorders), the author present a psychopathological model of psychosomatic (hypochondriac) symptoms in deficit disturbances, comorbid with the changes of «verschroben» type, observed in general medical practice.
The psychosomatic symptoms are represented by a wide range of symptom complexes (from idiopathic pain and conversions to restricted hypochondria, organ neuroses, encapsulated organ psychosis) and defined as a syndrome of endoform of somaticized disorders.  The syndrome is interpreted beyond schizophrenia as «the second disease», a type of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, in which negative process changes have stopped while the other component (positive psychopathological symptoms) continues to develop.
