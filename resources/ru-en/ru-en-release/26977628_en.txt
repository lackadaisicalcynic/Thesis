[Molecular genetic diagnosis and clinical features of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies in Belarusian patients].
OBJECTIVE
To analyze the molecular defect, a phenotype of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP, OMIM 162500), in patients with PMP22 gene mutation caused by 1.5 Mb deletion at 17p11.2. and present the principles of diagnosis and genetic counselling.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Patients were selected on the basis of the results of the clinical/genealogical analysis, neurological examination and ENMG study.
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
DNA diagnosis was performed in 5 families (the PMP22 deletion was found in 9 patients).  The authors described clinical and electrophysiological characteristics and presented a diagnostic protocol.
Identification of the mutation makes it possible to confirm the clinical diagnosis, assess genetic risks for the outcome and perform a prenatal DNA diagnosis in HNPP families.
