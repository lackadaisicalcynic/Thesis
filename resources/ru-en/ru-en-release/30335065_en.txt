[Clinical and psychological characteristics of children and adolescents with different forms of cognitive dysontogenesis in schizophrenia].
AIM  To perform a clinical and psychological analysis of cognitive dysontogenesis in children and adolescents with schizophrenia spectrum disorders based on the diagnosis, age at onset and disease duration.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and sixty-eight children and adolescents, aged from 7 to 16 years, with schizophrenia were studied.
The pilot assessment of the individual dynamics of cognitive development (21 patients) was made to establish the form of cognitive dysontogenesis (cognitive deficit).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Evaluation of harmony-disharmony and deficiency of basic cognitive processes in this patient population shows persistent disturbances of thinking, memory and attention which are more pronounced in severe forms of the disease and its early onset.
Age-related differences are observed as well.
