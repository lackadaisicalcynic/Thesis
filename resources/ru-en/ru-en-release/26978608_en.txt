[Features of polymorbidity in cardiac and gastroenterologic patients from a therapeutic clinic].
AIM
To examine the incidence of polymorbidity (PM) and changes in its rates in 2003 to 2011 in cardiac and gastroenterologic patients living in the Novosibirsk Region and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) in accordance with gender, occupation, and residence.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The dynamics of PM rates was analyzed in 13 496 patients who had been examined and treated at the Cardiology and Gastroenterology Departments, Therapeutic Clinic, Research Institute of Experimental and Clinical Medicine (Novosibirsk), 2003-2011.  The study used an archival research method and a statistical analysis of all nosological entities, groups, and classes in ICD-10, regardless of whether the diagnosis was primary or concurrent.
RESULTS
There was an increase in PM rates among the therapeutic clinic's patients of regardless of their gender and occupation.
There were gender differences in the incidence of PM: its higher rates were noted in the women than those in the men among both the residents of the Novosibirsk Region and those of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).
More significantly higher PM rates were registered in the male inhabitants of the Novosibirsk Region.
There were also regional differences in the incidence of PM: its rates proved to be higher in the patients in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) than in those in the Novosibirsk Region in 2003-2007.  At the same time, the growth rates for PM were more marked in the patients in the Novosibirsk region than in those in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia); these differences levelled off in subsequent years.
CONCLUSION  The findings indicate a pronounced increase in the incidence of PM in cardiac and gastroentorologic patients and determine a need to keep in mind the influence of gender, social, and regional factors on its development in order to create and improve a primary and secondary prevention, diagnosis and treatment system.
