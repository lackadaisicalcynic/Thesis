Age-related changes of microcirculation in pia mater of rats' sensorimotor cortex.  We studied the density of the microvascular network in the pia mater, the tissue perfusion and saturation of the oxygen of sensorimotor cortex of hypertensive rats of different ages.
Our investigations shown that the microvascular density in the pia mater was not only decreased, but also was increased.
The perfusion of sensorimotor cortex was reduced and tissue saturation was enlarged.
By the age of 12 months orienting-exploratory rats behavior became worse significantly in all major indicators of the test «open field».
