[Clinical and pathogenetic features of ischemic stroke among representatives of different gender and age].  We observed 1410 patients of different gender and age with ischemic stroke of 4 main clinical and pathogenic types - atherothrombotic, cardioembolic, hemodynamic and lacunar.
The dependence of the pathogenic type of stroke, background options for stroke pathology and risk factors of stroke on sex and age of patients was analyzed.
We founded out that atherothrombotic ischemic stroke is more common for persons of retirement age, and in working paeople - gap and hemodynamic once, although atherothrombotic strokes in this age group were more frequently observed among men.
The importance of hypertension in the development of ischemic stroke reduces with age, but the role of cerebral atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias increases.  As risk factors for ischemic stroke in the pension age physical inactivity, overweight and dyslipidemia play the main role, when reducing the role of smoking and stress, more relevant for working people.
The frequency of the presence of certain risk factors and background for ischemic stroke disease depends on the patient's gender, but in different age periods and under different pathogenic types of ischemic stroke this dependence changes and in people of retired age it is less distinct than in working people.
