[Characteristics of anxiety in patients of older age groups with different types of mild cognitive disorder].
AIM
To study the structure of anxiety symptom complex in patients of older age groups with amnestic, disregulatory and polymodal types of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and determine the clinical efficacy of 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate (mexidol).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-two patients over 55 years of age with MCI (ICD-10 item F 06.7) seeking medical help due to anxiety were included in the study.
Inclusion criteria were the compensation of concomitant diseases, absence of relevant stressful events during the last year, absence of depression.
Clinical-psychopathological method and psychometric scales (HAM-A, GDS, MMSE, CGI-S, CGI-I) and a stressful life events list were used.  Reduction of the total score on the HАМ-А was the main criterion of the efficacy of 4-week treatment with mexidol (375 mg daily).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  At baseline, mean scores on the HAM-A and MMSE were 39,9+3.18 and 25.7+0.6 respectively.
The study of the anxiety structure in patients with amnestic, disregulatory and polymodal types of MCI revealed the different phenomenology of anxiety symptom complex.  Repeated assessment of anxiety on the HAM-A was performed on 1, 2 and 4 week of treatment with mexidol.
The improvement of mental state was noted in all types of MCI but the better results were obtained in disregulatory and polymodal types.
The rate of anti-anxiety effect was higher in the disregulatory type of MCI.  In all patients, mexidol improved attention stability and autonomic function.
