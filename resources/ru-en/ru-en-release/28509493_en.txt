[Pinealon and Cortexin influence on behavior and neurochemical processes in 18-month aged rats within hypoxia and hypothermia].
The research of Cortexin and Pinealon within two models of stress, acute hypobaric hypoxia and mild hypothermia, within 18-month aged rats has been held.
The peculiarities of peptide preparations' influence on behavior and neurochemical indeces have been identified.
Cortexin shows a more pronounced effect on free radical processes and caspase 3 activity in brain than Pinealon.  Both preparations forward an accumulation of adrenergic mediator within rats' brains in the model of acute hypobaric hypoxia, as well as serotonin within cerebrum cortex in the model of mild hypothermia, which may underlie their geroprotective effects.
