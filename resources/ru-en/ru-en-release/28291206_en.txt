[Potential for use of hydroxypropyl guar in tear substitute therapy].
Of the large number of polymers used in artificial tear formulations, natural polysaccharides - hydroxypropyl guar, sodium hyaluronate, chondroitin sulfate, dextran, etc., are gaining more and more popularity.
Hydroxypropyl guar stands out through its ability to form a long-lasting structured matrix adhered to the damaged ocular surface and ensuring good wettability of the latter and regeneration of epithelial cells.
At that, the viscosity of hydroxypropyl guar increases with increasing tear pH (which, in turn, correlates with the severity of xerosis) and further prolongs the moisturizing effect.  According to experimental studies, the in vitro protective activity of hydroxypropyl guar surpasses that of sodium hyaluronate, which is widely used.
Thus, corneal epithelial cell cultures were more tolerant to drying and pericardial leaflets showed lower friction coefficient, if pretreated with hydroxypropyl guar and not hyaluronic acid.  Subsequent clinical studies showed that Systane Ultra was more effective in patients with dry eye syndrome than a carboxymethylcellulose and glycerol-containing drug.
It has been also proved that Systane Balance provides a greater increase in thickness of the tear film lipid layer and in overall stability of the tear film as compared to SootheXP, which has a similar lipid composition.
The present review also covers potential utility of other artificial tear formulations that, besides the moisturizing effect, are able to reduce the tear film osmolarity, prevent further oxidative stress, and abate the inflammatory process.
