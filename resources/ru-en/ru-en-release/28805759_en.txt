[Diagnosis and treatment of dorsopathy in patients with connective tissue dysplasia].
AIM  To study the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and treatment of dorsopathy in patients with connective tissue dysplasia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-six patients, aged from 18 to 45 years, with lumbar-sacral radiculopathies associated with connective tissue dysplasia were examined.
Detailed neurological examination, X-ray visualization and MRI of lumbosacral spine section, electromyographic assessment were performed.
A five-point scale of neuro-vertebrological symptoms, the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the Roland-Morris Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire were used.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The results contained own data on the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and treatment of dorsopathies in connective tissue dysplasias.  Inclusion of long-acting pentoxifylline (vasonite) in the combined therapy in patients with dorsopathy associated with connective tissue dysplasia had a positive effect on disease course, decreased pain intensity and improved life activities.
