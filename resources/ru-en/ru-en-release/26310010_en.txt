[Analyzing causes for opacification of acrylic IOLs].
AIM
to study the nature of intraocular lens (IOL) opacification depending on the patient's ocular status and general condition.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 9 patients (9 eyes) with 3-6 year history of progressive IOL opacification were enrolled.
All the IOLs were acrylic (either hydrophilic--7 cases, or hydrophobic--2 cases).
Two patients had their IOLs exchanged due to opacification.
Six patients earlier underwent glaucoma surgery.  Two patients were type 2 diabetic.
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and optical microscopy were used for IOL examination.
RESULTS
The surface of hydrophilic acrylic lenses appeared bumpy because of multiple variously shaped translucent granules separated by a chaotic network of furrows and microfractures and located predominantly in the optic zone.  In a more severe case, a bowl-shaped impression was observed in the area of opacification.
Surface changes of hydrophobic acrylic lenses were in the form of isolated and confluent glistening formations (microcavities).
CONCLUSION
Signs of IOL degradation develop over a long period of time (3-6 years, in our experience) and mostly involve the anterior surface of the lens optic.
Ocular comorbidity, glaucoma in particular, as well as other surgery and/or therapeutic treatment following IOL implantation may contribute to its opacification.
Analysis of published data and own observations suggest that hydrophobic IOLs should be preferred in patients with concomitant diseases, especially diabetes mellitus.
Granular deposits, if accumulate, may lead to deformation of the lens optic, as confirmed by the bowl-like impression in one of the explanted hydrophilic IOLs.
