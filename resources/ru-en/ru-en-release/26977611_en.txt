[Kidney allotransplantation from alive related donor in patients with Alport syndrome].
AIM
To evaluate the results of kidney transplantation from alive related donor in patients with Alport syndrome and to compare with those in patients with kidney hypoplasia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We have analyzed 8 and 27 medical records of patients with Alport syndrome and kidney hypoplasia respectively.  Following parameters were used - Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Wilcox overall risk, percentage of transplants loss and mortality (Fisher's exact test calculation).
RESULTS
It is concluded that percentage of transplants loss and mortality rate as well as overall survival and risk were similar in both groups.  CONCLUSION
Despite risk of anti-GBM nephritis development in patients with Alport syndrome results are comparable with those after transplatation for chronic renal failure caused by other reasons.
