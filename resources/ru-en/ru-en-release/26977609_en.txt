[The efficacy of endoscopic endosonography in diagnosis of benign and malignant stenoses of common bile duct].
AIM
To define criteria and to estimate diagnostic significance of endosonography in differential diagnosis of benign and malignant stenoses of common bile duct.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We presented the results of survey and treatment of 57 patients with benign and malignant stenoses of common bile duct.  The technique of endosonography is described.
We have formulated major criteria of differential diagnostics of tumoral and non-tumoral lesion of extrahepatic bile ducts.  Comparative analysis of endosonography, ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was performed.
RESULTS
Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of endosonography in diagnosis of stenosis cause is 97.7%, 100% and 98.2% respectively.  So it exceeds the efficacy of other diagnostic X-ray methods.
In modern surgical clinic endosonography should be mandatory performed.  It is necessary for final diagnostics of cause of common bile duct stenosis especially in case of its low location.
