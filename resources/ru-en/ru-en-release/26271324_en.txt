[Modified Limberg plasty in treatment of epithelial coccygeal passage].  UNLABELLED
The aim was analysis of results of Limberg skin-plastic closure of wound defect after excision of extensive fistulous forms of coccygeal passage with some modifications.  MATERIALS AND METHODS
41 patients with fistulous form of epithelial coccygeal passage degree III were enrolled into investigation.
Mean age was 35.6Â±6.4 years.  The modification consisted of asymmetric displacement of the lowermost part of excised diamond-shaped defect laterally from the median line and fixation of flap to inter-gluteal fold bottom especially its caudal part.
RESULTS
Noncomplicated course of early postoperative period with wound healing by first intention was observed in 38 (92.7%) patients.
Recurrent coccygeal passage developed in 1 (2.4%) patient and it was limited (fistulous passage in one of the wound edges).
