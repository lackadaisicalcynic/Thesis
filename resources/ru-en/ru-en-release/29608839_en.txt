[The treatment of elderly and senile patients with venous trophic ulcers and type 2 diabetes mellitus.]  The effectiveness of the inclusion of sulodexide in the pharmacotherapy of complex treatment of patients (n=52) elderly and senile with a combination of chronic diseases of the veins complicated by refractory trophic ulcers of the lower extremities, and type 2 diabetes mellitus was studied.
Patients were randomly randomized in the 1st (n=26) and the 2nd (n=26) groups, the statistical differences between them in age (t1-2=0,2, p1-2=0,833), sex (χ21-2=0,008, p1-2=0,991), nosology (χ21-2=0,004, р1-2=0,993); the anamnesis of chronic diseases of veins (t1-2=0,14, p1-2=0,893); duration of trophic ulcers (t1-2=0,21, p1-2=0,827); planimetric parameters of trophic ulcers (t1-2=0,18, p1-2=0,865) were not recorded.
Patients of the 1st group received treatment with sulodexide according to the standard schedule for 50 days.
The primary outcome of the study is the complete closure of the trophic ulcer after 1 month.
Secondary outcomes are epithelization after 2 months and dynamic planimetric indices within 12 months.
The effectiveness of the use of sulodexide was assessed according to the VCSS scale, dynamic changes in the malleolar volume and changes in planimetric parameters.
A statistically significant improvement in the overall VSCC score was observed in both the 1st (p=0,002) and the 2nd (p=0,0016) groups in all study outcomes.
At the same time, a statistically significant improvement in the VSCC scores was more pronounced in the 1st group (p<0,05).  After 2 and 6 months, a statistically significant decrease in the malleolar volume of the affected lower extremity was recorded both in the 1st (t=4,17, p=0,001) and in the 2nd (t=2,4, p=0,37) groups.
Clinically and statistically significant decrease in malleolar volume was more pronounced in the 1st group (p<0,05).
After 30 days, trophic ulcers were closed in 9 (34,6%) cases in the 1st group and in 5 (19,2%) patients in the 2nd group (p<0,05).
On day 60 epithelization was achieved in 22 (84,6%) and 12 (46,1%) patients, respectively.
The time of complete epithelization in patients of the 1st and the 2nd groups was 51,2±1,6 and 78,4±2,6 days (p<0,05).
The conclusion is made that sulodexide is an effective and pathogenetically grounded pharmacological preparation for the treatment of patients of elderly and senile age with chronic clinical disease C6 of clinical class and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
