[The choice of parameters for the laser application in ENT surgery].  The authors present the results and describe the methods of the experimental studies aimed at the evaluation of the biological effects of laser-assisted treatment of ENT pathologies at the wavelengths of 810 nm, 980 nm, and 1470 nm in comparison with the results obtained with the use of a radiofrequency scalpel in biological tissues having different optical and mechanical properties.
Special emphasis is placed on the peculiarities of the action of laser irradiation and healing of radiation-induced wounds depending on the treatment regimens, viz. contact, remote, pulsed and continuous ones.
The results of the analysis of the experience gained during the study and of the experimental findings provided a basis on which the main principles of the choice of the optimal parameters of the laser radiation action on the biological tissues have been formulated.
