[The use of agomelatine (valdoxan) in gambling therapy: a pilot study].  OBJECTIVE  To study the antidepressant agomelatine (M1/M2 agonist and 5-HT2C antagonist) in pathological gambling (PG) (ICD-10 item F63.0).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
An open label 8-week trial was carried out in 22 outpatients (17 male and 5 female, mean age 38±7).
PG severity was assessed by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale adapted for Pathological Gambling (PG-YBOCS).  Anxiety and depression level was measured by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS).
RESULTS
Agomelatine significantly decreased PG-YBOCS scores from the second week of the trial (12.6±3.0 compared to 24.2±2.1 at baseline, p<0.05).
In the end of the trial, PG-YBOCS score decreased to 5.3.
The total HADS score decreased significantly in the end of the study (from 23.6±2.9 to 11.4±1.9, p<0.05).
There was an improvement in behavior as well.  CONCLUSION
Thus, agomelatine has demonstrated efficacy in PG patients.
