[An effect of education and health literacy on the efficacy of rehabilitation of post-stroke patients].  AIM
To study an effect of education, health literacy and adherence to treatment on the efficacy of rehabilitation of post-stroke patients.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 1317 post-stroke patients.
Information on education, health literacy and implementation of complex rehabilitation was obtained using anonymous survey.
The duration of follow-up was 18 month.  Patients were examined at baseline and after 6, 12 and 18 month.
RESULTS
A significant correlation between adherence to rehabilitation treatment and the level of health literacy and education was shown.
An analysis of the efficacy of comprehensive rehabilitation demonstrated the statistically significant prevalence of patients with positive dynamics of neurological disorders among those who had fully completed the program.
