[Pathogenesis of chronic disorders of cerebral circulation].  Chronic disorders of cerebral circulation are a common syndrome, in the pathogenesis of which the important role play structural and functional alterations in large and small arteries, autoregulation of cerebral circulation and the level of systemic arterial pressure.
Drugs that increase cerebral blood flow and restore the ability to its autoregulation are used, among others, in treatment of patients with CRMC.
The possibility of using nicergoline (sermion) for the treatment of patients with CRMK is considered.
