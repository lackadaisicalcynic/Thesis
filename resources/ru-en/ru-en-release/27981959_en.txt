[Specific features of the injuries to the head inflicted by hits with long objects with the impact surface of various shape].  The article was designed to characterize the specific features of the injuries to the head inflicted under experimental conditions by hits with long objects with the impact surfaces of various shape.
The data obtained can be used to improve the conduction of forensic medical expertises for the identification purposes.
A combined approach for the layer-by-layer description of head injuries is proposed to be used for the identification of morphological features of interest.
