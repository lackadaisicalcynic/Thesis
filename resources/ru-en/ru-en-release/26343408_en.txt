[Clinical-experimental study of efficacy of tablets "corega t–∞bs for partial dentures" in individuals with arc dentures].  The aim of the study was to assess clinical efficacy of corega tabs cleaning tablets for dentures in 36 somatically intact patients aged 35 to 64 years with Class I and II defects of the lower jaw dentition treated with partial arc dentures.
Control group included 30 persons of similar age and condition of the oral cavity using traditional oral hygiene means.
The results of the study proved the absence of pathological galvanical phenomenas in metallic parts of arc dentures after exposure to a solution obtained by dissolving the cleansing tablets for partial dentures corega tabs.
The shown effect of passivation of the metallic parts of the arc prostheses may be seen as a preventive measure for the development of oral galvanosis in this group of patients.
