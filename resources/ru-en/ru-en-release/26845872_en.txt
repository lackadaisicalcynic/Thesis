[Study of common cytotoxicity of aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone antibiotics in cell cultures].
UNLABELLED
The aim of the study was to identify the overall cytotoxicity of aminoglycosides netilmicin and tobramycin, and fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We used three types of the cells: constantly transformed cell line CHO-K1, normal human skin fibroblasts and cells of normal human conjunctiva Clone 1-5C-4.  Antibiotics activity was detected by their influence on cell viability.
Quantitative and qualitative methods of evaluation have used to determine viability of the cells (quantitative assessment: a method of cloning cells and colorimetric method for assessing cell proliferation; qualitative assessment: lifetime visual observation under an inverted microscope for morphological status of cells in culture with photofixing).
RESULTS
The most toxic effect for all types of the cells was shown in tobramycin.
The least degree of toxicity for all types of the cells was determined in netilmicin.
CONCLUSION
Studied antibiotics exert a cytotoxic effect in vitro and differ in their cytotoxic potential.
