[The morphological features of the testicles under conditions of experimental acute and chronic alcohol intoxication].
This paper is designed to report the results of the comparative analysis of the structural alterations in the testicles under conditions of experimental acute and chronic alcohol intoxication in the laboratory rats.  It was shown that experimental acute alcohol intoxication causes only such changes that suggest the non-specific gonadal response to alcohol poisoning and represent characteristic manifestations of the general organ reactions.
The chronic exposure of the experimental animals to alcohol results in more pronounced changes in the testicles the severity of which depends on the duration of alcohol consumption.
