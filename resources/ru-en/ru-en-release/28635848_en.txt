[Stress adaptive effects after traumatic brain injury].  Neuroendocrine dysfunction, in particular impaired synthesis of anterior pituitary hormones, is a common complication of traumatic brain injury.
Deficiency of tropic pituitary hormones entails a hypofunction of the related peripheral endocrine glands and can be accompanied by persistent endocrine and metabolic disorders.  In particular, the hypophyseal mechanisms are the key ones in implementation of most stress effects.
Adequate implementation of these mechanisms largely determines a favorable outcome in the acute stage of disease.
Traumatic brain injury (as well as any significant injury) initiates a stress response that can not develop in full in the case of pituitary gland failure.
It is logical to suppose that the course of the acute phase of stress in the presence of hypopituitarism is different to a certain extent from the typical course, which inevitably affects certain adaptation elements.
In this review, we analyzed the adaptive effects of stress after traumatic brain injury.
