[Repeat prosthetic repair of the internal carotid artery].
Described herein is a clinical case report regarding reoperation on carotid arteries for thrombosis of a synthetic graft of the internal carotid artery in a patient presenting with a multifocal atherosclerotic lesion.
Despite medicamentous treatment carried out after the primary operation, the presence of major risk factors had unfavourably contributed to progression of the disseminated atherosclerotic process.  During eight years, the patient had endured reconstructive interventions on the brachiocephalic and coronary arteries, as well as on the vessels of the iliac-femoral-popliteal segment.
Taking into consideration the peculiarities of the vascular anatomy, the degree of stenosis of the internal carotid artery with the presence of thrombotic masses in the lumen, and thrombosis inside the graft, a decision was made to perform repeat "open" reconstruction consisting in successful common carotid-internal carotid prosthetic repair using a synthetic graft with resection of the external carotid artery.
