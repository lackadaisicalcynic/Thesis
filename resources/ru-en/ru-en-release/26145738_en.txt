[The clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of anterior craniofacial resection for the treatmentof disseminated tumours and pseudotumour lesions in the nasal cavity, the paranasal sinuses, and the orbit].
The objective of the present work was to evaluate the outcomes of anterior craniofacial resection (ACFR) in the patients presenting with disseminated tumours and pseudotumour lesions in the nasal cavity, the paranasal sinuses, and the orbit based on the results of dynamic clinical observations.
A total of 24 patients with tumours and tumour-like lesions of these anatomical structures were involved in the study including 14 ones having benign neoplasms, 2 patients with pseudotumour lesion, and 8 patients having malignant tumours.
In all the cases, the pathological processes in the form of destruction and infiltration encompassed the anterior portion of the base of the skull (mostly lamina cribrosae) and spread directly into the anterior cranial fossa.  It was shown that ACRF ensured the radical elimination of the pathological process and the enhancement of the five-year survival rate in all the patients with benign tumours and pseudotumour lesions and in half of the patients presenting with disseminated malignant neoplasms.
