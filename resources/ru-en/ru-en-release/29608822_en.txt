[Age-related risks of cancer (analytical indicators of registration and early diagnosis).]  Malignant tumors have a particular specificity of the frequency of tumors in different age groups.
The risk of cancer among people under 35 years of age is extremely low - 10-15 cases per 100 000 population of each age group.
After 35 years of age with each age-related year the likelihood of cancer increases by 10% and for a five-year period by 50-70% reaching values of 2-5 thousand cases per 100 000 population in older groups.
Knowing these patterns and details of localization structure for the each age it is possible to plan the implementation of a complex of anti-cancer measures correctly.
There are certain difficulties in the formation of state statistics of malignant tumors.
Not all administrative territories of Russia since 2011 had and have an access to database of deceased, which leads to the accumulation of «dead souls» in patient contingents.
Also there are distorted other analytical indicators.
There is a difficulty in staffing specialists of territorial cancer registries as well.
Despite a significant improvement in relative 5-year survival rates of cancer patients this process is much more modest in older age groups.
