[Psychosocial characteristics of elderly people who have committed suicide attempts poisoning].  The aim of this study is to identify psychosocial characteristics of older people who attempted suicide by self-poisoning.
A total of 44 older people with suicide attempts by self-poisoning was examined, 12 of whom were male and 32 were female, their average age was 71,9+10,8.
The comparison group consisted of 53 young people - 19 males and 34 females, their average age was 26,6+4,4.
In both groups dominated deliberate self-poisoning with antiepileptic, sedative, soporific, Antiparkinson and psychotropic drugs (40,9 % vs 47,2 %, p>0,05).
Amongst older people number of those who engaged in deliberate self-poisoning with drugs affecting the autonomic nervous system (25 % vs 9,4 %, p<0,05) was significantly higher.
Compared with younger adults, older adults are more likely to commit a suicide attempt with serious intentions to complete suicide (62,5 % vs 24,5 %, p<0,05).
There is a positive statistically significant correlation between the factor of «suicide attempt with serious intentions» and factors «loneliness» (Y=0,68), «severe physical illness» (Y=0,58) and «constant pain» (Y=0, 60).
