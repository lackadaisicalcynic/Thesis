[Clinical experience with the use of rivaroxaban in the treatment of cancer patients with venous thrombosis].
The urgency of the problem.
The incidence of various thromboembolic complications in patients with oncopathology reaches 5-12%.  When treating VTE in patients with oncology it is necessary to choose between two generally recognized alternatives.
The recommended two-component scheme of the initiating phase of anticoagulant therapy with subsequent long-term admission of VKA is fraught with the development of clinically significant bleeding during the initial selection of the dose of warfarin and an increased risk of recurrence of VTE.
Long-term parenteral use of LMWH is often negatively treated by patients and adversely affects compliance.  For these reasons, enteral administration of new oral anticoagulants is promising for prolonged anticoagulant therapy in this category of patients.
The paper cites three clinical cases of treatment of patients with acute venous thrombosis of deep veins against a background of different oncological processes.  In the first case - the operated previously for cancer, in the second case - to be treated over oncological process and in the third case - in the primary cancer detection.
DISCUSSION
The results of the studies of EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE allow us to consider the use of rivaroxaban in the treatment of patients with VTE on the background of oncopathology.
The possibility of its use from the first day, in our opinion, is a significant advantage, since it allows us to reveal the clinical effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy already during the first stage of treatment, since NOAKs does not imply the possibility of laboratory monitoring.
