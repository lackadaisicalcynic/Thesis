[The specific features of the clinical course and the treatment strategy in the children presenting with viral sinusitis].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the peculiar features of acute viral and bacterial sinusitis in the children and to elaborate the algorithm for their treatment based on the results of the primary clinical and laboratory examination.
As many as 224 children at the age varying from 1-17 years suffering from acute sinusitis were enrolled in the study.
The following methods were employed for the purpose of the study; the analysis of the medical histories of the patients, general examination by an otorhinolaryngologist, diagnostic endoscopy of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, radiological studies and computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses, echosinusoscopy, the comprehensive microbiological and virological investigation, and evaluation of the peripheral blood characteristics.
The study allowed to elucidate the main clinical specific features of acute sinusitis of different etiology including the virological one.
The scoring system for the estimation of the risk of development of acute bacterial sinusitis was proposed and the algorithm was developed for the treatment of the children suffering from acute sinusitis to be used in the practical work by general practitioners and otorhinolaryngologists.
