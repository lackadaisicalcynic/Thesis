Cash interventions to improve clinical outcomes for pulmonary tuberculosis: systematic review and meta-analysis.
Objective
To assess cash transfer interventions for improving treatment outcomes of active pulmonary tuberculosis in low- and middle-income countries.  Methods
We searched PubMed®, Embase®, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov for studies published until 4 August 2017 that reported on cash transfer interventions during the treatment of active pulmonary tuberculosis in low- and middle-income countries.  Our primary outcome was a positive clinical outcome, defined as treatment success, treatment completion or microbiologic cure.
Using the purchasing power parity conversion factor, we converted the amount of cash received per patient within each study into international dollars (Int$).
We calculated odds ratio (OR) for the primary outcome using a random effects meta-analysis.  Findings
Eight studies met eligibility criteria for review inclusion.
Seven studies assessed a tuberculosis-specific intervention, with average amount of cash ranging from Int$ 193-858.
One study assessed a tuberculosis-sensitive intervention, with average amount of Int$ 101.  Four studies included non-cash co-interventions.
All studies showed better primary outcome for the intervention group than the control group.  After excluding three studies with high risk of bias, patients receiving tuberculosis-specific cash transfer were more likely to have a positive clinical outcome than patients in the control groups (OR: 1.77; 95% confidence interval: 1.57-2.01).
Conclusion
The evidence available suggests that patients in low- and middle-income countries receiving cash during treatment for active pulmonary tuberculosis are more likely to have a positive clinical outcome.
These findings support the incorporation of cash transfer interventions into social protection schemes within tuberculosis treatment programmes.
