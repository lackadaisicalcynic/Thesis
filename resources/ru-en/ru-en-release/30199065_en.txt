[The precision of central jaw relationship estimation in restorative dentistry].
The aim of the study was to investigate accuracy of the most frequently used methods of obtaining centric relation in clinical practice.  Finding of CR was carried out in clinic of prosthodontic dentistry on a 5 patients with intact dentition using four methods that are most often used, including: bimanual manipulation, leaf gauge, using an anterior deprogrammind device, the technique of determining CR with intraoral devices recording the gothic angle.
To assess the accuracy of each technique there were performed 10 registrations of the central relation by one operator (200 CR registrations), with 30 minutes' intervals between the CA determination.  Analysis of the contacts in CR were carried out using a photometric method of investigation.
The graphic images were downloaded in Adobe Photoshop for calculation, metric data translated into digital values.  The studies above showed that the accuracy of finding CR in all methods were not ideal.
It can be noted that the smallest deviation of the position of the first contact in the CR was observed with use of the anterior deprogrammind device and with the intoral gothic angle recording device.
The deviation along the VO axis was 0.039±0.002 mm and 0.084±0.004 mm respectively, along the MD axis 0.043±0.002 mm and 0.054±0.001 mm, respectively.
The greatest error of recording the CR was shown by bimanual manipulation Dawson technique, the deviation along the axis of the VO and MD was 0.634±0.04 mm and 0.388±0.04 mm, respectively.
