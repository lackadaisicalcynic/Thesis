The study purpose was to determine the successful outcome rate of endoscopic endonasal reconstruction of skull base CSF fistulas with removal of meningocele as well as analyze disease relapses.  The second purpose of the study was to describe the treatment outcomes, depending on the type, location, and size of meningocele as well as on a technique used to reconstruct the skull base defect.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Three hundred and eleven patients diagnosed with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea who underwent surgery at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute in the period between 2007 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed.
Meningocele was detected in 141 (45.3%) of all patients with CSF rhinorrhea.
The diagnosis was made before surgery and verified during endoscopic endonasal reconstructive closure of skull base defects.  Therefore, the analysis group included all cases of meningocele and meningoencephalocele verified during surgery.
The study analyzed the gender, age of surgery, follow-up period, comorbidities, use of lumbar drainage, etiology of the defect, localization, type of reconstructive material, complications, and disease relapses.
We defined the efficacy of endoscopic endonasal meningocele resection with fistula reconstruction as the absence of signs of CSF rhinorrhea and a hernia sac based on the data of control CT and endoscopy performed in the late postoperative period.
The follow-up period ranged from 1 month to 5 years.
RESULTS
All patients underwent endoscopic endonasal reconstruction of the skull base defect.
The treatment efficacy was 110 (78%) patients for primary surgery and 26 (84%) patients for repeated surgery.
CONCLUSION
Endoscopic endonasal surgery is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive technique for treatment of meningocele and meningoencephalocele, which enables resection of a hernia sac and reconstruction of dura mater and skull base defects.
