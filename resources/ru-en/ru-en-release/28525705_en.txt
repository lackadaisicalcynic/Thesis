[Role of age chronotropic criterion in the increase motor activity on an inpatient stage of rehabilitation of geriatric patients with myocardial infarction].  We studied the efficiency of the age chronotropic criterion inpatient rehabilitation of geriatric patients with myocardial infarction, provides for an increase in heart rate when the motor activity to submaximal values for the particular age of the patients.
It was found that the inclusion of this criterion provides patients an optimal heart rate during exercise, the passage of the individual stages / riser activity, prevents the formation of cardiomyopathy induced tachycardia.
