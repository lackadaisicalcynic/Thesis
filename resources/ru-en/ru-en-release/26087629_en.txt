[Prognostic value of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and target organ damages for the occurrence of resistant hypertension].
AIM
To estimate the prognostic value of risk factors for cardiovascular events and target organ damages tor the occurrence of resistant hypertension (RH).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The 2008-2013 survey covered 7959 members of locomotive crews of the Transbaikal Railway whose medical expert examination revealed risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and target organ damages.  RESULTS
During the survey, a group of 7959 people with final outcomes included 21 RH cases to be statistically analyzed.  Atherosclerotic plaques in the carotids arteries, proteinuria, creatininemia, overweight, left ventricular hypertrophy, a family history of early cardiovascular diseases, and stress were the major predictors of RH.
CONCLUSION
The association of the established predictors must be considered in the treatment of patients with RH.
