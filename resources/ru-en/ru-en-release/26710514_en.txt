[Metabolism of designer drugs.  The fentanyl derivatives].
This literature review is focused on the studies of metabolism of designer drugs, with special reference to fentanyl derivatives.  Certain physicochemical characteristics of the main metabolites most frequently encountered in the illegal trade of the fentanyl group analgesics have been calculated.
The proposed recommendations include the methods for the identification of certain fentanyl derivatives during analysis of biological media.
