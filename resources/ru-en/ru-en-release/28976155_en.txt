[The tetrapeptide pankragen forte efficiency in elderly people with prediabetic state].  The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of tetrapeptide pankragen-forte in older people with prediabetic state.
A total of 150 healthy people of different ages, including 39 young people (20-39 years), 42 people. middle-aged (40-59 years) and 69 older adults (60 years and older).
As a result of screening, 69 seniors were selected 12 patients with impaired glucose tolerance, which, for the correction of glucose metabolism used Pankragen-forte as follows: 500 mkg 2 times a day (morning and evening) for 4 weeks.
All included surveyed was defined indicator of glycosylated hemoglobin, conducted a standard oral glucose tolerance test with determination of glucose, insulin in plasma glucose and venous blood at 30, 60 and 120 min after ingestion of 75 g glucose.
Pro-insulin levels were determined in plasma, venous blood glucose and 30-min OGTT.
Also calculated an index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin sensitivity index (Matsuda index) and functional activity of β cells of the pancreas
(HOMA- %). In 50 percent older people with impaired glucose tolerance use of pankragen forte led to a significant decrease in the concentration of plasma glucose during a standard oral glucose tolerance test, which indicates the normalizing effect of peptide drug in the violation of carbohydrate metabolism, which is consistent with the improvement of the lipid composition of serum blood, endothelial function, decreased platelet aggregation.
The use of peptide drug pankragen forte is promising correction prediabetic status in the elderly.
