[The age-related changes of the heart rate variability measurements: the role of the inflammation, oxidative stress and telomeres biology].
The autonomic and central nervous system, a number of humoral and reflex effects regulate the heart rate.
The main role in the heart rate regulation belongs to the autonomic nervous system.
A common method for studying the autonomic influences on the heart rate is the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), which allows to evaluate the neuro-vegetative status of the organism, determine its adaptive capacity, to evaluate the level of stress and the degree of tension of regulatory systems.  An age-related decrease of HRV measurements in healthy people reflects the weakening of the autonomic regulation of cardiac activity.
The most pronounced changes are found in patients older than 60 years.
The HRV depression is preceded by hemodynamic and metabolic disorders is associated with high cardiovascular risk and is a predictor of life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death in the elderly.  The reasons for HRV changes with age stay unclear.
In the light of modern ideas about the mechanisms of aging, several complementary theories proposed.  Telomere shortening, the role of oxidative stress and inflammation as possible mechanisms of age-related changes in the autonomic regulation of the heart rhythm, will be discussed in this article.
