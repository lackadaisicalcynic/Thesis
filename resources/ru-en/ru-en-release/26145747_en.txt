[The early prophylaxis of postoperative stenosis by means of modifiedendonasal functional dacryocystorhinostomy].  The objective of the present study was to increase the effectiveness of the prevention of the postoperative complications by means of the newly proposed modified variant of endonasal functional dacryocystorhinostomy.
The method was used to treat 230 patients presenting with chronic dacryocystitis.  It was shown that the new method permits to prevent the recurrence of the pathological process by virtue of the attachment of the middle nasal turbinates to the nasal septum and the prevention of its adhesion to the dacryostoma.
The prevention of fibrin precipitation near the operative field is possible thanks to the ointment discharge through the perforations towards the cavity of the newly for meddacryostoma .  Simultaneously, the formation of the organized blood clots is prevented.
At a later stage, the silicone plate introduced to adjoin the middle nasal turbinate becomes an obstacle to the formation of adhesions.
It is concluded that the proposed functional arrangement of the nasal structures and the outflow of tears makes it possible to reduce the recurrence of the disease to 2.1% of the cases.
