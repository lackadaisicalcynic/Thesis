[The prospects for the further development of the Belokurikha spa and health resort territory in the Altai Krai (region)].  We undertook a balneological survey of the Belokurikha spa and health resort territory with the purpose of distinguishing and identifying the potential health-improvement areas most promising for the extension and optimization of the therapeutic, tourist and recreational activities.
The assessment was focused on the characteristic of the landscape and climatic conditions of the territory, the possibilities for the development of the existing resources of mineral waters and therapeutic muds as well as for the discovery of the potential new ones.
The recommendations are proposed to promote the development of different forms of tourism with special reference to its medical and health-improvement aspects.
It is suggested that the territory of the «Belokurikha» resort», «Belokurikha-2» and «Belokurikha-3» health-improvement areas should be integrated into a single spa-and-health resort district of federal importance.
