A 4-year-old boy operated on for left parietal lobe cavernoma was diagnosed with a mass lesion during a follow-up MRI examination 4 months after surgery.  The patient was re-operated in connection with suspected abscess formation.
Inflammation was accompanied by the formation of foreign body granulomas, and, in some areas, had immune nature with signs of focal destructive vasculitis, delayed maturation of the granulation tissue, and disturbance of the current organization and encapsulation processes.  It is worth noting that granulomatous inflammation around a hemostatic material in the brain has no specific features during introscopy and mimics an abscess or tumor recurrence.
To prevent granulomatous inflammation, removal of a hemostatic material, if possible, from the surgical field is recommended when reliable hemostasis is achieved.
