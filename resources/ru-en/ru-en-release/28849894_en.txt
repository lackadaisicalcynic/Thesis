[Donor age affects on the «behavior» and the sensibility bone marrow cells in on copper ion of the primary culture].
The changes of bone marrow cells (BMC) number in the primary culture from 0 to 96 hours, the pattern (the distribution of cells) of cells morphotypes and «lifespan» (the time of cell life after isolation) of myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band and segmented neutrophils, isolated of the young (3 months) and old (20months) animals, were investigated.
The number of the BMC obtained from intact old animals increased faster in primary culture, than from young animals.  The Cu induced fibrosis had different influence on the rate of BMC culture growth of old and young animals.
The adding of 4 mM and 8 mM CuSO4x5H2O in the BMC culture of young and old animals resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of growth rate of young animal cells.
If copper ions were added into the culture of BMC of old animals, the decreased of the BMC number was described less than for cells of young animals.  The adding of 8 mM CuSO4x5H2O inhibited proliferation less, than the adding of 4 mM CuSO4x5H2O.
The Cu-induced liver fibrosis had accelerated the BMC rate death of both old and young animals.
However, this effect was more pronounced in young animals.
It is suggested, that during the ontogenesis the BMC undergo such epigenetic changes, which change functional properties.
