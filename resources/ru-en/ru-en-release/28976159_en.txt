[Apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis in development of myocardial remodelling in elderly patients with arterial hypertension].
To determine the apoptosis and interstitial myocardial fibrosis pathogenetic role in development of myocardium dysfunction we surveyed 84 patients of elderly age suffering from an arterial hypertension (AH) II stage by methods of echo- and dopplercardiometry, enzyme multiplied immunoassay of Nt-proBNP level, serumal markers of collagen exchange, apoptosis activity.
The patients with normal geometrical model of heart due to AH demonstrated a low level of apoptosis and fibrosis activity.  Structural reorganization of a myocardium from concentric to eccentric hypertrophy and concentric remodelling of left ventricle was characterized by strengthening of cellular apoptosis and interstitial myocardial fibrosis in extracellular matrix expressiveness, prevalence of collagen synthesis over collagen degradation, progressing of myocardium dysfunction.
