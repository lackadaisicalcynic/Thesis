[The prevalence and structure of ENT diseases in the children residing in the industrial regions].
The present study was designed to evaluate the state of the ENT organs in the children residing in the industrial regions characterized by the enhanced level of atmospheric pollution.  The results of the correlation analysis of the data obtained confirm the strong cause-and-effect relationship between the pathologies of the upper respiratory tract (such as allergic and catarrhal rhinitis, chronic pharyngitis, sinusitis, inflammatory tonsillar diseases, and adenoid vegetations), impaired local immune reactivity, and the index of general air pollution including that with nitrous dioxide, phenols, and particulate matter.
The results of the study suggest the necessity of more active detection of ENT diseases in the children at the early stages of their development together with regular medical examinations, and the implementation of purpose-oriented prophylactic, therapeutic, and health promoting measures.
