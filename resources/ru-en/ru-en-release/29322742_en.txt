[The functional state of nasal cavity in the aspect of structural-functional changes of the human organism in postnatal ontogenesis.]
Nasal cavity - «the primary line of defense» and a major division of the respiratory tract.  A variety of functional areas and regions, structural formations of the nasal cavity allows, at the present stage of development of biology and medicine, consider it as a complex functional subsystem in the structure of the respiratory system.
The age transformations of morphological and functional parameters of the nasal cavity are polymorphic and specific.
An important aspect of developmental physiology of the respiratory system is a study of the relationship of these changes with morphological and functional transformations of other systems of the body.
The article presents the results of the analysis of such contingency-for example, by endonasal correlations with amount of blood flow hemodynamics and functional state of the autonomic nervous system, respiratory function of the nasal cavity and respiratory system, as well as other functions of the nasal cavity and their relationship with general growth processes, critical periods of development and involution.
In the process of this analysis revealed a close correlation with complex changes of the morphofunctional parameters of the systems of the human body, most pronounced during in critical periods of postnatal ontogenesis.
