[Prospects of endoscopic technology for diagnostics of inflammatory periodontal disease].  The aim of the study was to analyze research methods for periodontitis severity and elaborate the most effective diagnostic combination.
Twenty patients with moderate periodontal disease were included in the study.  In addition to conventional diagnostic methods depth of periodontal pockets (PP) was measured by means of endoscopic system and cone bean CT.
Differences in PP depth estimated by probing and endoscopic evaluation was 1.2Â±0.4 mm proving endoscopic method to be useful and most precise tool for periodontal diagnostics.
