[Optimization of therapy for hepatobiliary disorders in psoriatic patients].
AIM  To optimize management tactics in patients with diseases of the liver and gallbladder in the presence of progressive psoriasis.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The investigation enrolled 78 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and different forms of gallbladder abnormality in the presence of progressive moderate and severe psoriasis.
The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: 1) phosphogliv; 2) ursosan with the main active ingredient ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).
A prospective follow-up study accompanied by dynamic clinical, laboratory, and instrumental monitoring was carried out for 24 weeks.  Clinical, biochemical, and ultrasound studies, including liver elastography, were applied.
RESULTS  The use of UDCA (Ursosan 15 mg/kg for 24 weeks) to treat NAFLD and gallbladder abnormality in methotrexate-treated patients with progressive moderate and severe psoriasis contributed to the normalization of hepatic steatosis index, lipid composition, and lithogenic index, to the reduction of biliary sludge, and to the stabilization of liver fibrosis.
Improvement in the functional status of the liver and gallbladder has contributed to the achievement of a more complete remission of dermatosis.
CONCLUSION
The effects of UDCA in the therapy of NAFLD and gallbladder abnormality in patients with progressive psoriasis were greater than those of phosphogliv.
