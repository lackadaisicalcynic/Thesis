The feasibility of descriptive epidemiology in assessments of dental caries disease in children in Russia and Belarus.  AIM
this study aims to estimate significance of the descriptive dental epidemiology in evaluation of the long-term effect of the Community program for prevention of dental caries.  METHODS
The descriptive dental epidemiology data of DMFT 12-year-old children in Belarus and Russia were analyzed since 1961 to 2014.  RESULTS
Meta-analysis of publications indicated that prevalence of dental caries has dropped from average 3.7-3.8 DMFT at baseline to 2.2-2.6 DMFT after 20 years of the programs implementation in Belarus and Russia accordingly.  However, during last 5-6 years a negative trend was assumed.
Based on long-term DMFT monitoring, the community programs in Belarus and Russia were effective in reducing dental caries by 30-40% for about 30-years period.  However, the observed trend was not stable perhaps due to insufficient scientific support of programs.
