[The application of combined low-intensity laser therapy for the treatment of the patients presenting with trophic ulcers associated with chronic venous insufficiency of the lower extremities].
AIM
The objective of the present study was the evaluation of the effectiveness of the combined treatment of the patients presenting with trophic ulcers associated with chronic venous insufficiency of the lower extremities of venous etiology with the application of low-intensity laser therapy (LILT) at different wavelengths.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included the patients presenting with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) (class C6 in accordance with the CEAP clinical classification). The ultrasonic Doppler examination (USDG) of the lower extremities revealed valvular insufficiency in the saphenous veins in 98.8% of the examined patients, in the deep venous system in 58% of them, and in the perforating veins in 72% of the cases.
The laser Doppler flowmetry technique was used to assess the state of the microcirculation.  Group 1 was comprised of 34 (43.59%) patients undergoing the traditional conservative treatment that consisted of pharmacotherapy (including antibiotic therapy, depending on the sensitivity of microflora assessed by the culture technique), the local treatment in the form of dressing in compliance with the standard surgical treatment schemes depending on the phase of the wound healing process, and elastic compression of the lower extremities.
The main group 2 consisted of 44 patients (56.41%) who were treated, in addition to the traditional conservative therapy, with the use of LILT according to the new technique that combines the external laser exposure of the trophic ulcer region using the 'LASMIK' laser device during a single 2 minute session per zone in the pulsed mode (light pulse duration of 100-130 ns, frequency 80 Hz), at a wavelength of 635 nm, by a matrix emitter (consisting of eight laser diodes with the surface area of 8 cm2), at a distance up to 7 cm, with pulsed power of 40 W, power density of 5 W/cm2, and the intravenous laser blood illumination (fiber output power 2 mW) with a wavelength of 365 nm (UV range) and 525 nm (green spectrum) alternately, every other day.  Each patient underwent 12 daily procedures per course.
CONCLUSION  The combined strategy makes it possible to carry out the more effective treatment of the patients presenting with trophic ulcers with the three-fold reduction of the ulcer healing time and the pronounced stimulation of the persistent adaptation of the physiological responses preventing the development of the relapses.
