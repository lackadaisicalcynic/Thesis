[Hyaluronic acid gel implants for correction of pathological conditions of the orbit and eyelids].
PURPOSE
To evaluate the effectiveness of injectable implants made of hyaluronic acid gel (HAG) in ophthalmoplastics.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 57 patients (37 patients with lagophthalmos related to acute or chronic facial nerve palsy, endocrine ophthalmopathy; 20 patients with enophthalmos, anophthalmic syndrome).
Depending on filler particle size, the patients received either intrapalpebral or intraorbital HAG injection.  The biometric measures of palpebral fissure, the position of the eye/implant, and the condition of the cornea were evaluated during the follow-up period (12 months for eyelid and 18 for orbital injection).
RESULTS
In the course of the follow-up, all patients showed reliable reduction of lagophthalmos; additionally, improvement of the condition of the cornea was observed in patients after intrapalpebral injection; patients after intraorbital injection exhibited reduction in enophthalmos, upper orbital palpebral fold retraction and upper eyelid excursion.
No serious complications have occurred after the injection.
CONCLUSION
As minimally invasive method of treating various pathologies of the orbit and eyelids, HAG fillers showed good clinical effectiveness and safety.
