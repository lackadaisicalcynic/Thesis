[The efficiency of the medical rehabilitation program with the use of injectable naltrexone for alcohol addicted patients who are at risk of parental rights deprivation].  AIM
To evaluate the efficacy of treatment of patients at risk of deprivation of parental rights due to alcohol dependence under the 'Point of Soberness' program including psychotherapy and intramuscular injections of extended-release naltrexone (vivitrol).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Results of therapy of 45 patients, 39 women and 6 men, are presented.
Out of 45 patients, 42 (93.3%) received a full course of injections of prolonged naltrexone (6 or more) as part of a comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation program.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Thirty-six (80.0%) patients maintained a remission.  In 9 patients (20.0%), single breakdowns and breakdowns, resulting in a relapse of the disease were recorded.
Forty-two patients (93.3%) retained their parental rights.
The return of children was made in one case.
The 'Point of Soberness' program makes it possible to achieve long remission of alcohol dependence, and to keep parental rights for these patients.
