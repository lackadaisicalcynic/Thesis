[Microcirculation in patients with paranoid schizophrenia].
AIM  To study microcirculation in patients with paranoid schizophrenia by laser Doppler flowmetry.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-three patients at the age from 18 to 38 years with a diagnosis of 'paranoid schizophrenia' (F20.0) were examined in the acute psychotic state and after 3 weeks of therapy.  The control group consisted of 20 healthy volunteers.
To assess microcirculation, the noninvasive technique of laser Doppler flowmetry using a laser blood flow analyzer was used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Significant changes in the microcirculation persisting even over three weeks of therapy in patients were identified.
The total microcirculation index was increased by 1.4 times which indicated the acceleration of blood flow.
An increase in the average fluctuations of perfusion by 3.7 times and in the coefficient of variation by 1.9 times, which reflect the excessive strengthening of local mechanisms of regulation of microcirculation, were found.  There were an increase in the myogenic tone and neurogenic tone of metarteriole and precapillary sphincters as well as bypass index.
