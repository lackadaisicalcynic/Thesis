[Roentgen endovascular treatment of common carotid artery dissection after eversion carotid endarterectomy].  The article deals with the use of self-expanding stents for endovascular treatment in patients presenting with dissection of the common carotid artery, exemplified by two clinical case reports.
In both cases, dissection of the common carotid artery developed after eversion carotid endarterectomy.
Intimal detachment was eliminated in both cases by implanting self-expanding stents.  These cases demonstrated possibilities of roentgen endovascular methods of treatment making it possible to successfully replace a repeat, technically difficult surgical intervention for iatrogenic dissection of the common carotid artery.
