[A phenomenological analysis of non-suicidal self-injuries in adolescents].
AIM  To perform a phenomenological/clinical/psychopathological analysis of non-suicidal self-injury behavior (NSSI) in adolescents.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The authors studied 155 adolescents, 140 girls and 15 boys, aged 12-17 years, including 111 with self-cutting, 5 with self-burning, 4 with self-beating.  Other cases included combined, multiple and other variants of NSSI.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  NSSI develop more often in female teenagers.
NSSI may be a component of suicidal behavior or represent a relatively independent behavioral model existing out of a suicidal context.
NSSI behavior can be considered as psychological defense as well as a coping strategy in response to nonspecific stress.
