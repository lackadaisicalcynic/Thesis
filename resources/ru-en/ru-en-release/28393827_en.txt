[Possibilities for optimization of eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection in modern clinical practice].  A steady decline in the effectiveness of standard eradication therapy (ET) regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection necessitates a search for ways of their optimization, by enhancing the efficiency of treatment protocols and by improving their safety and tolerability.
The review systematizes the data available in the literature on main accessible methods for optimizing ET regimens.
Among the optimization methods that can considerably enhance the efficiency of ET regimens, one may identify their addition of a bismuth agent (by 10-20%), the use of rebamipide (by 11.9%), adjuvant therapy with probiotics (by 8.1-13%), or double-dose proton pump inhibitors (by 8%).
Only adjuvant therapy with probiotics results in a significant decrease in the incidence of side effects from ET.  In posteradication period, rebamipide should be used to potentiate gastric mucosal repair and to regress inflammatory processes.
