[Cost price of robot-assisted and laparoscopic operations].
High cost of robotized complex and expendables is significant difficulty for its acquisition and introduction of robot-assisted operations.  Critical estimation of economic aspect is necessary for further development of robot-assisted surgery in our country.
Because of robotic variant is alternative to laparoscopic technique we assessed the prime cost of robot-assisted and laparoscopic operations.  The results may be used to assess recovery of expenses by state for high-technology care in clinic and to increase volumes of high-technology care using robotic techniques.
