[Psychopathological features of affective disorders in schizotypal disorder].
AIM  To explore psychopathological features of affective disorders in the structure of schizotypal disorder.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 102 patients with schizotypal disorder, aged from 18 to 60 years.
Assessment was done using clinical/ psychopathological method and psychometric scales - Calgary depression scale in patients with schizophrenia (CDSS), General Clinical Impression scale (CGI), Yang's mania scale (YMRS).  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Affective disorders are noted in the majority of inpatients with schizotypal disorder.
They are represented by depressive disorders of variable severity, and mixed depressive states.
A group of patients with schizotypal disorder was identified in whom the symptoms of the affective disorder constituted the main clinical picture of the disease, whereas concomitant neurosis-like disorders were formed solely during the exacerbation of depression, correlated with its severity and reduced on antidepressant therapy along with depressive symptoms.
Observed reversibility of productive disorders allowed us to consider the dynamic of these states as similar to the atypical affective phase, and the natural course of the disorder as close to the paroxysmal type in the form of distinct depressive phases.
In patients with persistent neurosis-like disorders, affective disorders accompanied axial symptoms of the disease and made a large impact on the structure of the exacerbation of the endogenous process.
A reduction of depressive symptoms in these patients was accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of axial symptoms of the disease, however the complete reduction of axial symptoms and remission was not observed.
