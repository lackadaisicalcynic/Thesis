[Anxiety/depressive disorders and vitamin D status].  OBJECTIVE  To search for the association between vitamin D status and anxiety and depression.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 310 residents of St. Petersburg (137 men and 173 women).
Anxiety and depression were measured with the HADS.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
In people with vitamin D deficiency, anxiety and depression were noted in 32.5% and 11.0%, respectively.
There were negative correlations between serum 25(OH)D level and anxiety (r= -0,11, p=0.03).  Symptoms of depression were not correlated with vitamin D status (r= -0.08, p=0.09) but were correlated with the age (r=0.12, p=0.02).
After excluding other risk factors for psychogenic disturbances (obesity, hypertension and impaired glucose metabolism) we concluded that serum 25(OH)D could be an independent risk factor for anxiety (R2=0.02, p=0.01) in the population studied.
