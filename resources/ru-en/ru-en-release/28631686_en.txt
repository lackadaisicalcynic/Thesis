[Laryngeal pleomorphic adenoma].  Pleomorphic adenomas are the most widespread epithelial tumours originating from the salivary glands.
In almost 90% of the cases, they are localized in the parotid salivary glands.  Pleomorphic adenomas only rarely affect the larynx.
To the best of our knowledge, as many as 27 cases of laryngeal pleomorphic adenoma have thus far been described in the special literature.
The present article was designed to report a case of pleomorphic adenoma in the larynx of a 76 year-old male patient.
The surgical treatment of this condition proved beneficial for the patient whose condition remains uncomplicated by the relapse of the tumour during the 5 year-long postoperative follow-up.
