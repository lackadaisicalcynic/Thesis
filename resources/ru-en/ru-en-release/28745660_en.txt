[Influence of vascular endothelial growth factor on angiogenesis and neurogenesis].  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known as a key mediator of angiogenesis, but there is also evidence of its broad significance in neurogenesis and neuroprotection.
Cytokines of the VEGF family affect neovascularization and neural development in the brain, particularly during cerebral ischemia, in which there is a coordinated interaction of angiogenesis and neurogenesis that contributes to rapid functional recovery.
This review examines the involvement of VEGF family members and their receptors in physiological and pathophysiological processes as well as the relationship between VEGF-A plasma levels and ischemic stroke.
