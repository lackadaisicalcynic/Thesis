[Thoracoscopic operations for neurogenic tumors in children].
AIM
To present an overall experience of endoscopic operations in children with neurogenic tumors in two medical institutions.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thoracoscopic excision of tumors was performed in 19 children aged 1 month-7.5 years (mean 1.5 years) in two clinics for the period 2010-2014.
In 9 children (47.3%) age did not exceed 1 year.
In our study ganglioneuroma was diagnosed in 9 cases, ganglioneuroblastoma--in 2 patients, neuroblastoma stage I--in 8 cases.
All patients were under observation and treated according to NB2004 protocol.
Tumor's diameter ranged from 1 to 6 cm (mean 4.9±1.9 cm).
Mean duration of surgery was 62±22 minutes.
There were no any intraoperative complications.
Early postoperative period in all patients after endoscopic surgery was more favorable than in those after open operations.
Any local recurrences were not observed for the follow-up period.  RESULTS
Thoracoscopic operations can become more preferable method in treatment of children with neurogenic tumors if great vessels are not involved into neoplastic process and limited volume of tumor is absent.
