[Rationale for the application of surface-enhanced Raman scattering for identification of main pathogens of purulent-inflammatory diseases in maxillofacial area].
The objective of the research was to elaborate experimental-theoretical and clinic-bacteriological rationale for the application of laser diagnostic for identification of main pathogens of purulent-inflammatory processes in maxillofacial area.
For germs identification by giant Raman scattering effect SERS-substrate with nano silver metallic balls, reference strains (Ps. aeruginosa 27853 and S. aureus 25923) and clinical cultures of Staphylococcus, Bacillus and Escherichia coli were used.
Using an example of purulent inflammation pathogens we considered that each of bacterial species is characterized by individual spectral lines of Raman scattering, which allows to identify them in short term (1-2 min).  Moreover the proposed method is highly sensitive (105-106 CFU/ml).
Creation of germs library and device portability makes use of laser diagnostic for express-indication purulent infections possible directly in clinical conditions.
Thus, analytical capability, quick result, high sensitivity and peculiarity, economical effectiveness due to lack of necessity to use growth medium and to transport it to microbiological lab gives an opportunity to consider laser diagnostic as a perspective universal express-method of clinical microbiology.
