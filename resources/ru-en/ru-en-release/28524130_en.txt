[Creation of extracranial-intracranial microvascular anastomosis under regional anesthesia (a case report and a review of the literature)].  The article describes a case of successful surgical treatment of an 81-year-old male patient with symptomatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery that led to severe impairment of cerebral hemodynamics and was accompanied by severe gait and equilibrium disorders.
Given the patient's age and his positive medical history, he underwent surgery for the creation of an extracranial-intracranial microvascular anastomosis under regional anesthesia, with spontaneous breathing and a baseline level of consciousness being maintained.
