Kidney injury secondary to endovascular treatment of renal artery stenosis.  In this paper, we present a case of kidney injury as a complication of renal artery angioplasty in a 54-year-old female patient that suffered from resistant renovascular hypertension.
This case emphasises the unpredictable nature of endovascular procedures, the need for careful post-procedure evaluation and the role of 'old fashioned' surgical techniques in resolving complications of endovascular procedures.
