[Recent trends in and new data on the epidemiology and prevention of non-communicable diseases].  Mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the country varies considerably among its regions and social strata of the population.
The main reason for providing inadequate conditions for a healthy lifestyle is that the state and municipal authorities and employers pay insufficient attention to the role of socioeconomic risk factors for NCDs.  Only an analysis of the reasons for changing mortality rates allows the correct course of actions to reduce mortality to be chosen and a national plan for the control of NCDs to be worked out.
The important mechanisms for improving the prevention of NCDs are to make better cardiovascular risk stratification systems, to introduce telemonitoring the status of the patients followed up, and to interface the prophylactic medical examination of elderly patients with a geriatric service.
The design of long-acting drugs is a promising way to increase the patients' motivation to control blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels.
