[Cardioprotective effect of the new derivative of glutamic acid - glufimet in acute immobilization-painful stress in animals of different ages].  The effect of the 24-hour immobilization-painful stress on myocardial contractility of young (6-month), middle-aged (12-month) and old (24-month) female rats was studied.
It was identified a reduction of the functional reserve of the heart, which showed a smaller growth rates of contraction and relaxation of the myocardium (+ dP/dt max and -dP/dt max), left ventricular pressure (LVP) and the maximum intensity of the functioning of the structures (MIFS) under increased pre- afterload and adrenergic stimulation of the heart, especially pronounced in the group of 24-month old rats.  The animals of all ages treated before and after stressing glufimet in a dose 29 mg/kg, have higher rates of growth + dP/dt max, -dP/dt max, LVP and MIFS during load tests, most significant rates of growth are noticed in older rats compared with the young and middle-aged.
Phenibut improves studied parameters equally at 6, 12 and 24-month old females, subjected to stress.
