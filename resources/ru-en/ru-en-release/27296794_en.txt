[A role of the Fas system in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke].  The Fas system can promote several biological effects due to their activation after ischemic stroke: apoptosis, inflammation, proliferation, differentiation.
Fas interacts with adapter proteins activating a number of signaling pathways, including MAPK, NFKB, JNK, ERK, phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, and caspase-dependent apoptosis.
Fas expressed by neuronal progenitor cells from the subventricular zone does not induce apoptosis in healthy adult humans.
During motion and differentiation of these cells, Fas regulates their morphological structure by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of cytoskeletal elements.
An increase in the Fas and Fas ligand expression is observed in response to stroke injury.
Fas responsible not only for cell death and inflammation but also for neuronal plasticity which occupies a central place in the processes of sanogenesis.
