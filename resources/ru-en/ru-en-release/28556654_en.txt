[Assessment of skin photoaging in middle-aged and elder patients with non-melanoma skin cancers].  The development of methods of early detection of non-melanoma skin cancers, assessment of risk factors, including photoaging, by means of non-invasive techniques are the main research interests of modern dermato-oncology and gerontology.
In our study we aim to investigate the range of clinical features of photoaging in 92 patients older than 50 years  (50 patients had malignant epithelial skin tumors (actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma), to reveal risk factors for basal-cell carcinoma using adapted SCINEXA scale and to assess of the pathomorphological features of dermathoheliosis using reflectance confocal microscopy.
The assessment of photoaging by means of SCINEXA with subsequent non-invasive evaluation using reflectance confocal microscopy allows to evaluate the cumulative effect of the ultraviolet irradiation on the skin with objective criteria.  That algorithm is perspective in terms of early detection of the risk factors of non-melanoma skin cancers.
