[Short-term outcomes of complete mesocolic excision for right colon cancer].  PURPOSE  Complete mesocolic excision (CME) appears to be a relatively new concept for colon cancer.  The purpose is to evaluate the results of CME with high vascular ligation (D3 lymph node dissection) for right colon cancer.
The presented study identifies possible risks and advantages of the proposed method, as well as the role of the laparoscopic approach.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The article included data from 39 patients with right colon cancer, TNM stage I-III, operated on between November 2015 and December 2016 in the oncoproctology Department of the Blokhin Cancer Research Center.
The analysis of main intraoperative parameters, morbidity and mortality was carried out.  RESULTS
There was no postoperative mortality.
17 (43.6%) of operations were performed by open and 22 - by laparoscopic approach.
The conversion for laparoscopic approach was 1 (4.5%) in 22.
The median duration of the operation was 180 (130-260) minutes for laparoscopic approach and 120 (90-280) minutes for open approach, р=0.0056. Median intraoperative blood loss was 30 (30-300) ml for laparoscopic approach, and 300 (30-500) ml for open approach (р=0.0001).
The duration of lymphorrhoea, time to first bowel movement, time to start liquid and solid food intake were 5.1±2.4, 1.3±0.5, 1.26±0.4 and 3.2±0.7 days, respectively.
The median number of removed lymph nodes was 35.7 (6-68), the median number of metastatic lymph nodes was 1.9 (0-16).
The median number of removed apical lymph nodes was 10.3 (0-24).
Metastases did not affect any of the lymph nodes of the apical group.
CONCLUSION
Right mesocolic excision with D3 lymphadenectomy for right colon cancer is technically safe, and the laparoscopic approach provides all the benefits of minimally invasive surgery and excellent early treatment outcomes.
Preliminary data shows no metastasis in apical lymphnodes for right colon cancer.
Nonetheless, it is necessary to study the long-term results for the evaluation of oncological outcomes.
