[The influence of Memoplant monotherapy on the dizziness].  The objective of the present work was to study the influence of the dry extract from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba EGb 761 (used as monotherapy at a dose of 120 mg twice daily during 4 months) on the vestibular function of the patients presenting with cochleovestibular pathology of peripheral and mixed genesis.
We present the results obtained by the objective and subjective methods for the evaluation of the vestibular function as well as the neurological and psychoemotional state of the 40 patients that was carried out during the four months of memoplant monotherapy.
It is concluded that monotherapy with the use of the dry extract from Ginkgo biloba leaves can be applied for the purpose of improvement of static and dynamic balancing state.  Moreover, this memoplant preparation can be used as a means of prophylaxis of recurrent dizziness that in addition reduces the severity of anxiety and depression without producing adverse side effects.
