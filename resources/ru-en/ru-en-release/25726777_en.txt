[Some variants of premanifesting disorders in attack-like schizophrenia].
OBJECTIVE
To investigate a spectrum of disorders preceding the development of manifesting psychosis in the aspect of their topology and possible prognostic value.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Authors examined 60 outpatients, 21 women and 39 men, aged from 22 to 34 years.
All patients were diagnosed with attack-like progressive schizophrenia.  The retrospective evaluation of disease history and determination of the psychopathological structure and dynamics of manifesting episode and premanifesting symptom clustering were carried out.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
It was identified 4 variants of premanifesting disorders: affective (n=15), affective with neurotic-like symptoms (n=17), affective with hallucinatory/paranoid symptoms (n=21) and affective with deficit symptoms (n=7).
These disorders determine not only the transparent symptomatics but project in the manifesting episode structure and has a prognostic value thus reflecting a trend towards the continuous course of schizophrenia already at the premanifesting stage.
