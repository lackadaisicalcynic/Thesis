[Effect of internal limiting membrane peeling on morpho-functional state of the retina in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (preliminary report)].  PURPOSE
To compare morpho-functional parameters of retina during vitrectomy with and without internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 55 patients (55 eyes) that had underwent vitreoretinal surgery in the setting of antivasoproliferative therapy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  Patients of the 1st group (n=27) underwent vitrectomy with silicone tamponade, 2nd group (n=28) received similar treatment with the addition of ILM peeling.
Best Corrected Visual Acuity before treatment was 0.06±0.02 in both groups; after the treatment it improved to 0.1±0.05 (p<0.05) in the 1st group and to 0.25±0.05 (p1-2<0.05) in the 2nd group.  Thickness of the 'nerve fiber layer - internal limiting membrane' in the macular area was 28.67±2.21 µm in both groups before the treatment.
By 3-month follow-up its thickness increased to 46.44±2.56 µm (p<0.05) in the 1st group due to the formation of epiretinal membrane (ERM).  In patients of the 2nd group 'nerve fiber layer' area thickness amounted to 28.41±1.88 µm (p1-2<0.05) and ERM could not be identified in any of them.
CONCLUSION
ILM peeling during vitrectomy with following silicone oil tamponade eliminates the risk of ERM formation in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy in the follow-up period of up to 6-month and results in better morpho-functional parameters in comparison with patients who received similar treatment but without peeling.
