[Parameters of prosaccades and antisaccades as potential markers of anxiety disorders].
AIM
To evaluate the parameters of visually-induced saccades and antisaccades in drug-na√Øve patients with anxiety disorders.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  A sample consisted of 18 subjects, including 10 healthy people and 8 patients with the diagnosis of anxiety disorder (ICD-10 items F43.0, F41.0, F41.1, F42).
The authors' method of video-oculography was used to assess eye-movement reactions.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
An increase in latency of correct antisaccades (AS) and visually-induced saccades (VIS) in patients with anxiety disorders was found.  The effectiveness of task performance did not differ compared to healthy controls.
A decreased generation of predictive saccades was identified in the experimental group.
Possible neurophysiological foundations of the saccadic dysfunctions are discussed.
