[Treatment of syringomyelia associated with Chiari 1 malformation].  Syringomyelia (SM) develops due to the disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, spinal fixation or a spinal tumor.
The disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the area of the foramen magnum leads to the progression of SM in Chiari 1 malformation (CM1).
CM1 is the most prevalent pathology of craniovertebral junction associated with SM.
The prevalence of CM1 varies from 3 to 8 per 100 000 population but SM is diagnosed in 65% of patients with CM1.
Clinical symptoms of CM1 and SM include pain in the occipital area, gait disturbances due to sensitive ataxia, dissociated sensory disorders, dysphagia, paresis of the extremities.
In most patients, symptoms of SM progressed over the years.
The diagnosis is based on MRI results of the brain and spinal cord.
Phase-contrast MRI is used to study the disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in details.
Progression of SM or CM1 symptoms needs surgical treatment - decompression of the posterior cranial fossa for the recovery of normal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics.
