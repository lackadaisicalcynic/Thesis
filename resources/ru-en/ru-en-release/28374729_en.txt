[The informative value of the functional step test for the purpose of computed optical topography in the children presenting with the functional disorders of the musculoskeletal system].  This paper is devoted to the characteristic of the informative value of the functional step test with the application of the heel cushions in the children for the purpose of differential diagnostics of anatomic and functional differences in the length of the lower extremities.
A total of 85 schoolchildren with different length of the lower extremities have been examined.  The comparative evaluation of the results of clinical and instrumental examinations was undertaken.
The data obtained with the help of the functional step test give evidence of its very high sensitivity, specificity, and clinical significant as a tool for the examination of the children with different length of the low extremities.
It is concluded that the test is one of the most informative predictors of the effectiveness of rehabilitation in the children with different length of the lower extremities.
