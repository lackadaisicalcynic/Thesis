[Correlations between the level of social functioning and the severity of psychopathology in patients with paranoid schizophrenia in remission].
OBJECTIVE
to determine the variants of correlations between the level of social functioning and the severity of psychopathological signs of disease in patients with paranoid schizophrenia in remission.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Fifty outpatients with paranoid schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20.0) were examined.
The sample included 26 (52%) men and 24 (48%) women, aged from 24 to 64 years.  Psychopathological, psychometric (PANSS, CDSS and PSP scales) and sociometric methods were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Correlations between clinical signs of disease and the level of social adaptation were found in 60% of patients, while in 40% of patients the correlations were not established.
Based on the correlations between clinical symptoms assessed by the PANSS and the level of social adaptation (PSP), the authors singled out 4 groups: 1) compensated (compensation in clinical and social aspects), 2) decompensated (decompensation in clinical and social aspects), 3) adapted (severe clinical symptoms with satisfactory social compensation, 4) conflict (low level of clinical signs (nonpsychotic disorders) and marked social decompensation).
These variants were found in 32%, 38%, 11% and 19% patients, respectively.
This classification of psychosocial status may be a base for prospective studies of the efficacy of psychosocial and medical/rehabilitative measures.
