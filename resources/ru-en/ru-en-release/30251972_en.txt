[The features of emotional processing in patients with depressive disorders].  AIM
To study neurocognitive symptoms in depressive disorders with the designation of their brain and psychological mechanisms.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Thirty-three patients diagnosed with depression and 33 healthy controls were studied using standardized neuropsychological tests and tests comprising emotiogenic stimuli.
RESULTS
A neurocognitive deficit in patients with depression manifested as changes in speed of emotional processing and some cognitive functions.  These patients demonstrate decreased attention to negative stimuli combined with decreased attention to positive stimuli.
The abnormal processes of 'hot' cognition in patients with depressive disorders conceptualize such a core symptom of depression as anhedonia, which is a probable endophenotype of depression.
