[Pathological redundancy of the motor act: modern concepts of the pathogenesis and approaches to the pharmacological treatment].  The authors present characteristics of pathogenetic mechanisms of pathological motor redundancy in children with neurological and psychoneurological pathologies examined in accordance with the original author's concept.
Pathological mechanisms of the development of motor redundancy, including obsessive movements, hyperkinesia, compulsions, motor and sensory stereotypes, taking into account a certain unity of mechanisms of their origin at the anatomical level, are described.
The article demonstrates the differences in the formation of these pathological motor acts associated with changes in their function, i.e. neuromediation and neuromodulation, in certain structures of the central nervous system.
