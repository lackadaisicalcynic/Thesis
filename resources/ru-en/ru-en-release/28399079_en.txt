[The mathematical modeling of the injurious impact on the tibial bone for the evaluation of the conditions leading to its fracture].  We have undertaken the mathematical modeling of the process associated with the destruction of the diaphyseal and proximal epiphyseal parts of the tibial bone by means of the finite element analysis.
The main emphasis was laid on the elucidation of the topography of force stresses in the model bone.  It was shown that loading the upper third of the bone either along its axis or perpendicular to the surface (i.e. in the region formed largely by the cancellous tissue) results in the depressed fracture at the site of the impact.
Loading of the mid-third region of the bone (characterized by the predominance of the compact tissue) under the same conditions led to the transverse fracture originating from the side opposite to the impact application site.
