[Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography as the most perspective diagnostic method for unstable atherosclerotic plaque of carotid artery].
Problem of internal carotid artery disease diagnosis appears to be crucial today.
Complications of this pathology are strokes and transient ischemic attacks.
There is no technology for their prediction or at least stratifying risks.  Some recent researches are devoted to a new diagnostic method.
This new technology is called Contrast Enhanced Ultrasonography (CEUS) and followed by outstanding results in studying the morphological peculiarities of internal carotid artery plaques and predicting the probability of complications.  CEUS is a new way for atherosclerotic process analysis because it is able to detect intraplaque neovascularization and vascular wall inflammation.
