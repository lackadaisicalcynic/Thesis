[The modern epidemiological characteristics of oto- and rhinosinusogenic intracranial complications].  The objective of the present study was to survey epidemiology of oto- and rhinosinusogenic intracranial complications that are currently diagnosed at the territory of the Russian Federation.
The work was based on the analysis of the official statistical reports together with the data obtained from the chief specialists responsible for the otorhinolaryngological services in 32 subjects of the Russian Federation during the period from 2009 to 2014.
It was shown that the state of the otorhinolaryngological service in the period covered by the study was characterized by the reduction in the number of beds available for the patients presenting with ENT pathology by 14.0% and the lowering of the hospitalization rate for the general population by 6.3%.
The frequency of oto- and rhinosinusogenic intracranial complications among the patients hospitalized to occupy the beds intended for the care of the patients suffering from ENT diseases was estimated at 0.03% and intrahospital lethality at 21.2%.
The prevalence of pyogenic intracranial complications associated with the inflammatyory pathology affecting ENT was 0.61 per 100.000 population per year, with the mortality rate amounting to 0.17 fatal outcomes per 100.000 population per year.
The study revealed significant correlation of the principal medico-statistical characteristics of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)---?? between themselves and with the parameters of ENT morbidity and activities of the otorhinolaryngological services at the territory of a given administrative territory.
It is concluded that the improvement of the quality of healthcare for the population presenting with intracranial complications and inflammatory ENT diseases is possible only on the baseis of the combined and interdisciplinary approach to the solution of the problem.
