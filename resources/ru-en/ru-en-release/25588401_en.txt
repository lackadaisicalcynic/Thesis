[Recurrent mixed parotid tumor localized in pharyngeal processus].  Tumors of pleomorhic adenoma parapharingeal space of the parotid gland amount for less than 20% of all salivary gland tumors.
In most cases these tumors are benign, and pleomorphic (polymorphous) adenomas prevail among them (up to 80-90%).
The frequency of their malignization varies from 3.6 to 30%.
Pleomorphic adenoma of parapharingeal space of the parotid gland was removed from patient S., aged 23 years, in head and neck department of RROI.
Tumors of superficial part of the parotid gland were removed from the patient 5 times during the last 10 years maintaining the integrity of the facial nerve.  Each time the tumor was pleomorphic adenoma morphologically.
After physical and x-ray (CT, MRI, MRI with angiography of neck vessels) examinations a tumor -- pleomorphic adenoma -- was removed with submandibular method.
The control MRI check showed continued growth.
Radiation therapy was prescribed, after which the pronounced therapeutic effect was noted.
The patient has been observed for 8 months without recurrence.
