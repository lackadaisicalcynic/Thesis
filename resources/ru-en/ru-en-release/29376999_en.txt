[Phenazepam: to the question of the efficacy and safety of benzodiazepine derivatives].
The widespread use of benzodiazepines in general medicalpractice in patients with complaints of anxiety and insomnia is due to a combination of efficacy and relative safety.  Benzodiazepines have several advantages over other groups of sedatives: a wider range of doses between anxiolytic and sedative effect, a higher ratio between the average lethal and average effective doses, the lower risk of abuse.
However, with prolonged use of even therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines (more than 6 months), the risk of dependence may increase - more often with the use of high-potency short-acting drugs.  Nevertheless, this risk with the correct use of drugs is greatly exaggerated.
In many patients, prolonged therapy with benzodiazepines causes an improvement in the condition without the development of serious side effects.  Do not abandon the use of this group of substances, following prejudices, but the appointment of benzodiazepines requires a thorough diagnostic assessment of the patient's condition and rational use of drugs.
