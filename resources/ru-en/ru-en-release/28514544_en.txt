[Geriatric aspects in oncocoloproctology (review)].
Severe comorbidity significantly limits the use of active surgical tactics in patients of older age groups suffering from colorectal cancer (CRC), leading to the abandonment of the necessary operations in 20 % of cases.
The low use of radical surgical tactics are not always related to objective difficulties, but often can be due to the stereotypical approach to solving the question of the treatment of the elderly patient, which leads to unreasonable refusal of surgical intervention.  Today is not defined by a single concept of surgical treatment of patients with colon cancer in elderly and senile age.
There is no universally accepted system for determining the functional operability in this group of patients, not developed specific algorithms for their preoperative preparation and perioperative management.  In this regard, the search for new approaches to surgical treatment of geriatric patients with CRC, allowing, on the one hand, to increase the percentage of completion radical surgery, and on the other, to reduce the number of postoperative complications in this numerous group of patients, is one of the priority tasks of Oncology.
