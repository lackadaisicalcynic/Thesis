[Modern approaches to the diagnosis of precancerous pathology and early lung cancer].  AIM
To assess the possibilities of modern diagnostic techniques to diagnose precancerous pathology and early central lung cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Analysis of Russian and foreign publications for precancerous pathology and early lung cancer, results and comparison of various diagnostic techniques.
RESULTS
Central lung cancer has a stepwise development with transformation of normal bronchial epithelium to hyperplastic followed by focal metaplasia, dysplasia, cancer in situ (CIS) and microinvasive cancer.  Fluorography, chest X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and sputum cytology examination are used to diagnose lung cancer.
However, endoscopy plays a leading role in diagnosis of early central lung cancer which rapidly and effectively detects changes of tracheobronchial tree mucosa at the initial stages of carcinogenesis thanks to the use of modern techniques (spectral, autofluorescent and ZOOM - endoscopy).
