[The influence of light deprivation and luzindol on ovulatory function of rats].  The age dynamics of ovulatory function of rats which were kept in conditions of light deprivation and receiving luzindol (a blocker the melatonin receptors) is investigated in this research.
Cytological research of an estrous cycle was conducted quarterly within two years.
It is defined that the age changes of an ovulatory cycle in the mode of light deprivation came later and were less expressed in comparison with similar changes at control rat females kept in the conditions of standard lightning.
In case of the blockade of melatonin receptors by luzindol, the dynamics of aging of reproductive system corresponded to the one in the control group kept in standard lightning mode.
