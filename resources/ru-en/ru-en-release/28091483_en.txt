[The enhanced efficiency of nystagmus detection using the modified Frenzel goggles with congenerous illumination].
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficiency and convenience of using the new modified Frenzel goggles in diagnostics of spontaneous nystagmus.  It was shown that the modified Frenzel goggles provide more homogeneous lightening of the eyes and better diagnosis of peripheral latent spontaneous nystagmus in comparison with the traditional Frenzel goggles, available at the market.
The questionnaire survey held among the doctors using both types of the goggles showed that the modified Frenzel goggles are more convenient for detecting spontaneous nystagmus in everyday practice.
