[. Role of molecular and genetic factors in survival from uveal melanoma].
AIM  to analyze survival rates in uveal melanoma (UM) patients and establish correlations with chromosome 3 monosomy, chromosome 1p deletion, and RASSF1A methylation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Methylation-specific PCR analysis was performed in 104 patients with histologically verified UM.
RESULTS
A statistically significant correlation has been found between chromosome 3 monosomy, on the one hand, and mixed/epithelioid cell melanomas and ciliary body involvement, on the other.
As for chromosome 1p deletion, it has demonstrated association with extrabulbar tumor growth.  We have also calculated 5-year survival and mortality rates in «large» UMs and their relationship with chromosome 3 monosomy, chromosome 1p deletion, and RASSF1A methylation.
Chromosome 3 monosomy is associated with lower survival rates, while RASSF1A methylation - with a better prognosis.  A combination of molecular and genetic changes (particularly, chromosome 3 monosomy and chromosome 1p deletion) also leads to reduced survival in UM patients.
