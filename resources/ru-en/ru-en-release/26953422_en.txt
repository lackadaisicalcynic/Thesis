[Expression markers of innate and adaptive immunity in gingival biopsies of patients with chronic generalized periodontitis during treatment].
Objective was to evaluate changes in expression of TLR, CD4, CD8 and CD20 in the mucosa of the gums occurring under the influence of basic treatment in patients with periodontitis.
Fifty-seven periodontitis patients that received basic treatment were included in the study, gingival mucosa biopsies were obtained and immunohistochemical evaluation of the expression of TLR-2, TLR-4, CD4, CD8 and CD2 and the severity of acanthosis were assessemd in course of treatment.
It is shown that one month of therapy significantly reduces the amount of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in gingival epithelial cells, populations of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in the inflammatory infiltrates, whereas no significant differences in the quantitative distribution of CD20-lymphocytes have been identified.
Marked regression of inflammatory changes in therapy and decrease the severity of acanthosis.
Therapy aimed at reducing the bacterial load in the mouth was associated with good clinical effect, as evidenced by the periodontal index and the innate immune system suppression to reduce susceptibility to periodontal patogens combined with the suppression of acquired immunity cells level in the gingival mucosa during treatment.
At the same time, the protective ability of pathogens supported by the persistence of populations CD20-lymphocytes with the ability to activate humoral adaptive immunity was also seen.
