[Secondary dry eye syndrome after keratorefractive surgeries and approaches to its treatment and prevention].
The article reviews the particularities of development and pathogenesis of secondary dry eye syndrome (DES) after refractive surgeries including a complex of problems related to changes in tear film content, damage of eye surface and neurotrophic epitheliopathy.  Additionally, modern algorithms of treatment and prevention of secondary DES in patients after refractive surgeries are described.
Despite the transient nature of the changes, excimer-laser surgery can lead to lasting deficiencies of eye surface in some patients.  Therefore, intensive and early treatment of secondary DES during the early follow-up period after refractive surgery may significantly reduce risks of tear dysfunction and neurotrophic epitheliopathy development in the long term.
