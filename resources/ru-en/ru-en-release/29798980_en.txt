[A role of microRNA in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke].  Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.
Among all the causes of IS, cardioembolic stroke (CEI) accounts for up to 40%.
Based on the literature data, modern ideas about the role and location of cardiac diseases in the pathogenesis of CEI are presented.
The leading cause of CEE is non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation.
Numerous attempts to study and prove the genetic nature of the development of IS led to the discovery of new markers - micribonucleic acids (microRNAs), the regulators of gene expression, that inhibit mRNA translation and play a key role in the pathogenesis of IS.
This review summarizes the current knowledge of microRNAs, their ability to simultaneously regulate several target genes, and their significance as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in IS.
