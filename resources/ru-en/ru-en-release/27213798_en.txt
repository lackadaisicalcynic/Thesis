[Assessing resveratrol effect on ocular blood flow in experiment].  AIM  To study the effect of resveratrol on ocular blood flow in vivo in healthy rats and those that underwent retinal ischemia/reperfusion.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The experimental study was performed on 40 Wistar rats (40 eyes).
For ocular blood flow evaluation, color Doppler imaging (CDI), power Doppler (PD), and pulsed-wave spectral Doppler ultrasonography were performed using the Voluson E8 Expert ultrasonic diagnostic system (GE Healthcare).
All rats were given resveratrol per os for 2 months of the study.  Retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced by a subconjunctival injection of endothelin-1.
The control group included 10 intact animals.
RESULTS
Signs of ischemic damage of the anterior and posterior eye segments were less pronounced in rats that were given resveratrol during both pre-ischemic (30 days) and post-ischemic (30 days) periods of follow-up.  There was also a statistically significant increase in the peak systolic and end diastolic velocity of blood flow as well as a decrease in the resistive index of retrobulbar arteries in those rats that underwent ischemia/reperfusion as compared to the controls.
CONCLUSION
Long-term resveratrol use (2 months) has proved effective in improving ocular blood flow in a rat model of retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury.
