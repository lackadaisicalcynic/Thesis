[The cellular and molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis regulation in the brain].  This review presents the data on cellular and molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis regulation linked to the vascular epithelium.
According to current conceptions, activated endothelial cells and their predecessors (progenitor cells) are involved in the regulation of angiogenesis.
These cells synthesize angiogenic molecules differing by the chemical structure and mechanism of biological effect and allowing a direct or indirect control over each stage of angiogenesis.  Both the excess and insufficient angiogenesis can lead to fast and irreversible changes in nervous tissue under certain conditions.
For this reason, the balance in the system of molecular stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis is especially important for brain function.  Without adequate reperfusion of an affected brain area the post-stroke neuroreparation, which can be provided with timely stimulation of angiogenesis, is unattainable and the intensification of this process in tumors, on the contrary, has adverse consequences.
Growth of a tumor and its metastatic spread are substantially associated with an increase in the level of tumor tissue vascularization, and blocking angiogenesis is often the only productive way to limit the growth of a tumor.  However our knowledge of mechanisms of angiogenesis regulation in the brain on the cellular and molecular level in physiological and pathological conditions is still insufficient, and, therefore, the influence of angiogenic factors on tissue targets do not always cause the expected effects.
