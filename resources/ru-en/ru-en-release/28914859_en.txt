[Depression, anxiety, and stress in patients with coronary heart disease].  The analytical paper summarized the results of recent studies of an association of depression, anxiety, and stress with coronary heart disease (CHD).
Mental disorders are shown to be associated with increased risk of CHD and to worsen the course of coronary disease.
Antidepressants and psychotherapy improve the control of mental disorders, quality of life, and, in some cases, have a positive impact on the course of coronary disease.
