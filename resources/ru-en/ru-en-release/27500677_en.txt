[The contingency of the therapeutic effectiveness with the peculiarities of the non-pharmacological treatment of the patients presenting with chronic cholecystitis].  The elaboration of new technologies for the medical rehabilitation of the patients presenting with chronic cholecystitis in combination with chronic opisthorchiasis is a topical problem facing modern clinical gastroenterology.
The application of up-to-date non-pharmacological therapeutic modalities, such as ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) therapy concomitantly with group chronophysiotherapy makes it possible to significantly improve the final outcome of the treatment.
The results of clinical studies give evidence of the favourable influence of the combined chronorehabilitative treatment including UHF therapy on the characteristics of the functional state of the biliary-hepatic system and of the organism as a whole.
The positive dynamics of these characteristics is suggestive of the high (up to 87,5%) therapeutic effectiveness of the proposed treatment.
The investigations into the relationship between this effect and the peculiarities of the combined therapeutic modalities have demonstrated their correlation (χ2=104,13; p=0,0001; V-Kramer´s coefficient =0,35) and showed that the use of combined chronorehabilitation including UHF therapy based on the application of phone resonance radiation guarantees (and is a predictor of) high therapeutic effect (percent concordance =95,6%; standard coefficient=2,13; p=0,001) of the treatment of the patients with chronic cholecystitis in combination with chronic opisthorchiasis.
The statistical analysis of the results of application of the modern non-pharmacological therapeutic modalities and the chronobiological approach for the purpose of the combined treatment of patients presenting with chronic cholecystitis in combination with opisthorchiasis with the use of contingency table and logit regression, allowed not only to estimate the interdependence and interrelation between the characteristics of interest but also to reveal predictors of therapeutic effectiveness.  These findings are of great practical importance since they can be used for the choice of therapeutic strategies for the management of this category of patients.
