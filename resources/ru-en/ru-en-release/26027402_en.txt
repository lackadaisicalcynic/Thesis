[Angiogenesis and its association with inflammation and fibrosis in course of the development of scleroderma systematica].  Scleroderma systematica (SDS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by severe fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs.
Vascular disorders are an important component of the disease, but the mechanisms of vascular injury and their prevention are unknown.
Angiogenesis in SDS is accompanied by the apparent expression of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and basal or fibroblast growth factor.
Imbalance of these markers with endostatin expression is noted.
This disease is characterized by inflammation and the intensity of neoangiogenesis correlates with its activity.
The fact that there may be a pathogenic relationship between the processes of angiogenesis and the intensity of further fibrosis is shown.
There is a vicious circle of the induction and maintenance of the processes of angiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis in SDS.
