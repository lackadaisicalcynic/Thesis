[The resistance of teeth to vertical root fractures after mechanical preparation and irrigation of root canal (pilot study)].  UNLABELLED
The aim of the study was to assess the influence of external root anatomy, time of irrigation and the rate of mechanical enlargement of root canals on root fracture resistance.  Thirty six bovine teeth were decoronated and divided into 2 groups: with round and oval forms of axial root slices.
The root canals were mechanically enlarged according to standard protocol and prepared for post placement.
Individual cast posts were made for each tooth, the diameter of posts comprised 1/2 or 1/3 of the root diameter in different subgroups.  After mechanical enlargement, the canals were irrigated with 3% sodium hypochlorite for 10 or 60 minutes in different subgroups.
The teeth with posts were subjected to static vertical load by universal testing machine with the speed of 1 mm per minute.
The load that had led to fracture initiation was noted.  Analysis of variances was used to assess the statistical significance of the
RESULTS  No statistically significant differences were found between the groups with different protocols of mechanical preparation and irrigation.
Teeth with round axial root slice were significantly less susceptible to fractures than ones with oval shape of axial root slice taking into consideration the protocols of mechanical preparation and irrigation.
