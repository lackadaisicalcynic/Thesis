[A choice of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with regard to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular' risks].  NSAIDs are effective drugs among analgesics and antiinflammatory drugs used widely in clinical practice.
It is important to emphasize that the range of users of NSAIDs in population are patients with chronic disorders of the joints and spine.
However,when prescribing NSAIDs one should consider risk factors of side-effects not only from the gastrointestinal tract, but cardiovascular events as well.
The potential negative risks of using NSAIDs promote an active research on creation of ne...y medicinal substances which are able to minimize NSAID-induced complications.
The use of oxide-nitrogen-associated NSAIDs, in particular amtolmetin guacil1in patients with risk factors of side-effects from the gastrointestinal tract and cardiovascular system seems to be promising.
It is noted that amtolmetin guacil has balanced analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects and is well tolerated.
