[The clinical and bacteriological study of the effectiveness of the application of silver nanoparticle for the treatment of tuberculosis].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the expediency of the application of nano-scale silver preparations, argovit-C and vitargol, differing in concentration for the treatment of tuberculosis of the upper respiratory tract.
The study was carried out based at the Karachaevo-Cherkessian TB dispensary.  It has been demonstrated that the 3.3% solution of argovit-C possessed of the 100% bactericidal activity with respect to the medically-resistant mycobacteria at both maximum and minimal concentrations of isoniazid.
Based on these findings, this preparation was chosen for the clinical study.  It was shown to exhibit a higher therapeutic effectiveness in comparison with the standard anti-tuberculosis treatment.
The authors conclude that the inhalation of the 3.3% argovit-C solution twice daily for 10 minutes during 2 months can be recommended for the local treatment of laryngeal tuberculosis.
