[The results of the multicenter pharmaco-epidemiological observational project on the use of mydocalm in the treatment of pain syndromes with the muscle spasm].
The prospective multicenter open noncomparative pharmaco-epidemiological observational project on the use of mydocalm in real clinical practice has been completed in 2013.
The project has been performed in 2090 clinical/rehabilitation settings in 284 cities of 13 countries using the results of 35,383 patients.  The project aimed to assess the safety of treatment (percentage of patients with adverse-effects) and pain relieving efficacy as well as patient's satisfaction with the treatment.
In total, 6603 (19%) adverse-effects were recorded.
Their severity was evaluated as mild in 84,48%, no serious adverse-effects were noted.
The high efficacy of mydocalm in the treatment of pain syndromes with the muscle spasm has been demonstrated.  The high level of tolerability and absence of the clinically significant increase of adverse effects in the combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been confirmed.
