[The first experience of TAPP and TEP allohernioplasty in patients with inguinal hernias at CRH].
AIM
To improve the outcomes in patients with inguinal hernias by application of advanced minimally invasive procedures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The article describes an experience of 59 laparoscopic allohernioplasties in 48 patients at the central regional hospital.  There were bilateral hernias in 11 cases.
Transabdominal preperitoneal (n=49) and extraperitoneal (n=10) placement of polypropylene mesh graft were used.
RESULTS
Intraoperative complications such as sigmoid colon lesion occurred in 2 patients with sliding left-sided hernia.
Mortality was absent.
Mean hospital-stay was 5.4 days, 12-month examination after discharge did not show any recurrent hernias.
CONCLUSION
Positive results of TAPP and TEP hernia repair justify their application as minimally invasive techniques in patients with various inguinal hernias at CRH if appropriate technical training and motivation of surgical team are present.
