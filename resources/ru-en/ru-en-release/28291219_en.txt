[Surgical treatment of a pregnant female with AVM hemorrhage].  Hemorrhages from arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in pregnant females are rare, but they are known to lead to high maternal and infant mortality.
There are no standards for AVM treatment in pregnant females.
Many authors believe that AVM resection before delivery improves the prognosis for life and health of the mother and fetus.
In this paper, we present a case of successful surgical treatment of a female patient with AVM hemorrhage at 20 weeks and address management issues of these patients.
