[The modern aspects of the treatment of the patients presenting with bilateral laryngeal paralysis depending on the duration of the disease].  the objective of the present study was to increase the functional effectiveness of the combined treatment of the patients presenting with bilateral laryngeal paralysis on the basis of the development of a medical diagnostic algorithm taking into consideration the peculiar etiological and pathogenic features of the clinical course of the disease.
The study included 102 patients suffering from bilateral paralysis of the larynx.
The duration of the disease varied from 2 months to 26 years.  All the patients underwent the preoperative preparation followed by laryngoplasty surgery for unilateral myoaritenoidchordectomy.
The patients who had no tracheostoma at admittance were treated by simultaneous tracheostomy and laryngoplasty.
The study made it possible to identify the factors that exerted the adverse influence on the outcome of the operation, such as prolonged cannulation, a protracted course of the disease (for more than 1 year), longer periods of recovery of the external respiration function characteristics, increased duration of the hospitalization and rehabilitation periods that lasted over more than one year, and a rise in the number of the patients carrying the cannulas.
Taken together, the proposed algorithm for the examination and treatment of the patients presenting with bilateral laryngeal paralysis, the early diagnostics of the disease, and the differential approach to its treatment made it possible to reduce the frequency of the immediate and long-term postoperative complication and decrease the duration of hospitalization and rehabilitation of the patients.
