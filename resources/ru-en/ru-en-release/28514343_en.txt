[Effect of dexmedetomidine on perfusion of free flaps transferred to head and neck].  The paper presents the impact of perioperative care on feasibility of free fibula flap transfer for facial reconstruction.
Flaps vitality was measured by means of somatic oximetry in 85 patients aged 20-74 years receiving reconstruction procedures in midfacial and lower facial areas.
The patients were divided in three groups according to sedation agent used postoperatively.  It has been demonstrated that dexmedetomidine postoperative sedation significantly improved free fibula flaps perfusion compared to propofol sedation.
