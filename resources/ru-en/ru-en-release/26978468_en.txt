[Spleen-preserving D2 lymphodissection in gastrectomy].  AIM  To analyze immediate and remote results of surgical treatment of 480 patients with gastric cancer who underwent total gastrectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study group included 371 patients who had spleen-preserving D2 lymphodissection during gastrectomy and control group consisted of 109 patients after D2 lymphodissection with splenectomy.
Duration of surgery was 183.7±33.8 and 184.1±30.9 min in study and control groups respectively (p=0.72), blood loss - 330.2±33.7 and 351.8±28.8 ml (p=0.0001), incidence of postoperative complications - 6.7% (25 cases) and 4.6% (5 cases) respectively (p=0.5), mortality rate - 2.7% and 0.9% respectively (p=0.46).
Number of excised regional lymph nodes of groups 10 and 11 was in most patients of the study group - 5.8 and 5.5 (p=0.92).
Metastases in splenic hilus lymph nodes were diagnosed in 28 (7.5%) and 9 (8.2%) patients of the study and control groups respectively (p=0.30), metastases in lymph nodes along splenic vessels - in 24 (6.5%) and 7 (6.4%) patients respectively (p=0.90).
RESULTS
5-year survival in the study group was 40.3±3.0%, average life expectancy - 3.4±3.3 years, in the control groups - 33.1±5.6% and 2.7±2.5 years respectively.
It was concluded that spleen-preserving D2 lymphodissection decreases incidence of postoperative complications and has similar drastic nature as standard lymphodissection with splenectomy.
