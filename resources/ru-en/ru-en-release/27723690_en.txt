AIM  to determine the indications and to evaluate early and long-term outcomes of total pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Treatment of 29 patients who underwent one- and two-stage pancreatectomy for different malignancies was analyzed.
RESULTS
Median of surgery duration and intraoperative blood loss was 280 min and 2200 ml respectively.
Postoperative complications were observed in 9 (31%) patients.  There were 2 (6.9%) deaths.
1- and 3-year overall actual survival was 61% and 16% respectively in case of ductal adenocarcinoma.
Median was 18 months.
Patients after surgery for primary multiple lesion (cancer of pancreatic body-tail and major duodenal papilla), pancreatic metastases of renal cancer, mucinous cystadenoma and neuroendocrine cancer are still alive.
Follow-up periods are 4, 49, 49 and 65 months respectively.
CONCLUSION
Total pancreatectomy is difficult intervention followed by severe metabolic disorders.  However it can improve long-term survival with acceptable incidence of postoperative complications and quality of life if clear indications for surgery are present.
