[Autoimmune anti-NMDA-R encephalitis].  Anti-NMDA-R encephalitis is a relatively frequent form of autoimmune encephalitis.
Initial clinical features of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis resemble those of schizophrenia exacerbation which resulted in hospitalization of patients to mental care facilities.
Taking into account high lethality and potential curability, detection of this condition is an important clinical problem.
The authors describe a case report of encephalitis with NMDA-R antibodies.
This report is the first in the domestic literature.  The difficulties of timely diagnosis, diagnostic criteria and treatment algorithm are presented.
