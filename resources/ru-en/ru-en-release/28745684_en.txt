[Autoinflammatory diseases and kidney involvement].
Autoinflammatory disease (AID) is a new concept formulated from the results of studying the pathogenesis of familial periodic fevers, a heterogeneous group of genetically determined diseases characterized by causelessly recurrent exacerbations of the inflammatory process due to genetically determined disorders of innate immunity and accompanied by uncontrolled hypersecretion of interleukin-1 (IL-1).  These mechanisms were a basic model for understanding a wide range of rheumatologic and other inflammatory diseases of the internal organs.
The late diagnosis of AIDs and their ineffective treatment increase the risk for the development and progression of secondary AA amyloidosis.  Elaboration of both clinical and effective laboratory criteria for diagnosing autoinflammation is of great importance for determining the tactics of anti-inflammatory therapy and prevention of complications.
