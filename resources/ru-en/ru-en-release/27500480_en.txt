[The peculiarities of preservation of the soft tissues and bone structures under the conditions of prolonged corpse deposition in the high-latitude cryolitic zone (the island Bely near the Kara Sea coast)].  The objective of the present work was the primary forensic medical/medical criminalistic study of exhumed human remains with the determination of the main group characteristics for the purpose of evaluation of the degree of preservation of the soft tissues and bone structures under the conditions of prolonged corpse deposition in the high-latitude cryolitic zone.
The materials available for the study consisted of the exhumed remains of 13 corpses.  The author describes the transformed features of the soft tissues and bone structures.
The former look like a grave wax.  It is shown that the peculiar morphological features of the preserved soft tissues and bone structures depend on the burial depth and the characteristic natural factors of the high-latitude cryolitic zone.
The main conditions influencing the state of the objects for the forensic medical expertise are considered including prescription of corpse burying, ground properties, freeze/thaw cycles, the influence of sea water, and microbiological factors.
