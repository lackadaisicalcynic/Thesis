[Common variable hypogammaglobulinemia: the author's observation].
The paper gives a case history of a patient with common variable hypogammaglobulinemia (CVHGG).  Its clinical picture was characterized by frequent inflammatory airway diseases, pansinusitis, and periodic rises in temperature up to febrile ones.
The diagnosis was established on the basis of the decreased serum concentrations of immunoglobulins (IG) A, M, and G, the unusual small intestinal (SI) wall relief created by large lymphoid follicles, as well as the characteristic sign of CVHGG, namely, the lack of plasma cells in the lamina propria of the SI mucosa.
Antibacterial therapy was noted to have a good effect that confirmed the leading role of excessive bacterial growth in the pathogenesis of chronic diarrhea and fever, which are the major clinical manifestations of CVHGG in this patient.
