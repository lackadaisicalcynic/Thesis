[The efficacy and safety of etoricoxib versus meloxicam in the treatment of patients with gonarthrosis].
AIM
To evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of etoricoxib and meloxicam in patients with gonarthrosis.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS  A postregistration, open-labeled, prospective, comparative randomized study was conducted.
40 patients aged 37 to 75 years with primary knee osteoarthritis were examined.  Therapeutic effectiveness was evaluated determining the functional index WOMAC with the use of a visual analogue scale (VAS).
The tolerability of the drugs was assessed according to the opinions of a patient and a physician.
RESULTS
Both drugs caused a reduction in WOMAC and VAS scores for pain and the severity of the disease.
Etoricoxib demonstrated a significantly high rate of occurrence and completeness of its analgesic effect.
Meloxicam showed a less pronounced decrease in joint stiffness and an insufficient analgesic effect.
The incidence of side effects was similar in both groups.
CONCLUSION
Both drugs demonstrated a good tolerability and a low incidence of side effects.
The efficacy of etoricoxib was significantly higher than that of meloxicam.
