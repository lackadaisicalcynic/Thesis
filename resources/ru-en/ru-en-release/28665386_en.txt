[Modern diagnosis and treatment in children with congenital basal encephalocele].
Basal encephalocele is a rare disease that predominantly occurs in children.  Its most common symptoms include nasal liquorrhea, difficulty in nasal breathing, and deformity of the naso-orbital region.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study group included 19 patients with basal encephalocele, aged 2 months to 18 years.
Ten (59%) patients were operated on through a transnasal endoscopic approach; 3 (17.5%) patients were operated on through a transcranial approach; 4 (23.5%) patients were operated on using a combined approach: the patients underwent simultaneous elimination of a cranio-orbital region deformity using the basal transcranial approach as well as hernial sac resection and hernioplasty using the transnasal endoscopic approach.
Two children had no surgery due to minimal symptoms and a lack of cerebrospinal fluid leak.
RESULTS
Application of the algorithms for diagnosis and treatment of encephalocele, suggested by the authors, enabled making the timely diagnose, defining the optimal surgical tactics, and achieving good treatment results.
CONCLUSION
A differentiated approach to the choice of a surgical technique for basal encephalocele, the use of auto-tissues for skull base reconstruction, intraoperative and postoperative lumbar drainage, and simultaneous elimination of deformity of the fronto-naso-orbital region enable avoiding complications and achieving good functional and aesthetic results.
