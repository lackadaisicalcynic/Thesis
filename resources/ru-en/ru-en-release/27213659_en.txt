[Balloon dilatation of the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube in the children presenting with relapsing exudative otitis media].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of balloon dilatation of the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube in the children presenting with relapsing exudative otitis media.
A total of 15 children (22 ears) at the age from 3 to 16 years suffering from relapsing exudative otitis media over 18 months in duration were available for the examination.  Neither conservative nor surgical treatment produced any stable beneficial effect in these patients.
Acoustic impedancometry yielded type B tympanograms.  All the children were treated with the use of balloon dilatation of the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube under endotracheal anesthesia.
The follow-up examination carried out within 6--8 weeks after the treatment revealed the complete recovery of the function of the middle ear (type A tympanograms) in 11 (73.3%) children.  Partial restoration of this function (as evidenced by type C tympanogram) was documented in 4 children.
These patients underwent the second course of conservative therapy that resulted in the complete restoration of the function of the middle ear.
It is concluded that balloon dilatation of the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube in the children presenting with relapsing exudative otitis media provides the efficient and safe approach to the management of this condition.  Being a minimally invasive method, it has good prospects for the practical application and is worth further investigation.
