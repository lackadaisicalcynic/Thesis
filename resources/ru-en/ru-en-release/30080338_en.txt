Importance of music in biographies of people with dementia.  Recent research on music and music-based interventions for people with dementia (PwD) is focused on changes of psychological and cognitive functions.
Little is known about the role of biography in the importance of music to PwD.  A qualitative study was conducted to identify the phases of their life in which PwD were influenced by music.
20 semi-structured interviews with PwD from nursing homes and PwD cared for at home were conducted.
Additionally, their relatives were interviewed separately.
The results were analysed relating to four categories divided into past and present with the aim of identifying the changes in daily routine and challenges for everyday care.
First access to music and education mostly were built in the family setting.
Social participation e.g. music activities, listening to music and playing instruments changed dramatically with the onset of dementia.
Moreover, PwD generally needed assistance in participating in those activities.
The dependency on their caregivers and inability to express their needs leads to a daily routine without music.
There is a need of trained professionals motivating and assisting PwD to attend musical activities.  In addition, care homes should offer more music activities and music therapy for PwD with various stages of dementia.
Moreover, care institutions should implement music questionnaire in the patient's file regarding musical preferences.
