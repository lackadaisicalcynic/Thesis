[Technique of invaginative pancreatojejunostomy in pancreatectomy].  Pancreatoenterostomy is one of the key moments in pancreatic surgery.
It was proposed invaginative pancreatojejunostomy in end-to-side fashion by using of two continuous single-row purse-string sutures.  This technique may be used in pancreatoduodenectomy and Beger's procedure.
This method will be useful in cases of edematous and erupting pancreatic parenchyma and hard-to-differentiate lumen of pancreatic duct.  It is followed by reduced trauma of tissue and bleeding, allows to avoid sutures failure and to achieve sealed anastomosis.
