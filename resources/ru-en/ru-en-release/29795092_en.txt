[Capabilities of 18F-FET PET/CT in a patient with brain glioma (a case report and literature review)].  Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) enables assessment of not only anatomical and structural but also metabolic changes in tumor mass.
18F-fluoroethyl tyrosine (18F-FET) PET/CT is based on evaluation of transport of 18F-labeled tyrosine in tissues.  We present a clinical case of a patient with a newly diagnosed brain tumor, demonstrating the capabilities of 18F-FET PET/CT in assessing the reliable volume and degree of tumor anaplasia, which is important when choosing the treatment approach for a patient.
