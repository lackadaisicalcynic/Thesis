[Stress-induced dissociation in the trajectory of schizotypal personality disorder (on the model of nosogenias in oncologic patients)].  OBJECTIVE
Stress-induced dissociative disorders (DD) have high prevalence in psychiatry and general medicine but the psychopathological differentiation of DD and contribution of personality disorders in their development is less studied.  Authors conducted a clinical analysis of stress-induced persistent DD and underlying constitutional abnormalities.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  It was examined 20 patients with DD induced by the stress caused by a cancer diagnosis, including 10 patients of detachment-dissociation group (denial of the disease, non-compliance) and 10 patients with compartment-dissociation (complete or partial detachment of stress response components (emotional, cognitive), adequate compliancy).
The groups were matched for demographic and cancer characteristics.
Clinical and psychological methods were used.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
DD are secondary psychopathological phenomena.
Detachment-dissociation develops in the frames of schizophrenic nosogenic reactions based on overvalued ideas of somatic well-being (or complete recovery from cancer) and has some similarities to schizotypal personality disorder.
Compartment-dissociation develops within the limits of neurotic nosogenic reactions on the basis of binary psychogenic complexes - pathology of the imagination ("the beautiful indifference") concomitant to anxiety about the real illness and is similar to hysterical personality spectrum.
