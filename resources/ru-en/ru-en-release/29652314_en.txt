[Cervical vertigo: a neurologist's point of view].  Cervical vertigo (CV) hasnot yet been recognized by many neurologists, as it has no specific clinical symptoms and reliable diagnostic criteria.
However, over the past 150 years, there has been accumulated numerous experimental and clinical evidence to support the legitimacy of CV allocation as a separate nosology.
This review presents data regarding the vertigo associated with neck pathology: possible evidence of CV existence and the description of its type as well.
The principles of CV diagnosis and treatment are considered, an attempt to create a unified concept is proposed.
