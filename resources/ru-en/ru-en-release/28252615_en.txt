[Optimization of the solid-phase extraction procedure for the screening of the medicinal and narcotic substances in the blood by gas chromatography with mass-spectrometric detection].  This paper was designed to describe the application of the method for solid-phase extraction of the medicinal and narcotic substances having different physicochemical composition by gas chromatography with mass-spectrometric detection (GC-MS) for the purpose of their screening in the blood.
The solid-phase extraction technique was optimized by means of the Box-Behnken modeling with the evaluation of the influence on the effectiveness of extraction of various factors including pH of the buffer solution, eluent composition, the type and the volume of the solutions used to wash the sorbent.
