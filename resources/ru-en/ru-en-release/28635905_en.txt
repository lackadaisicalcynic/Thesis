[Algorithm for the management of patients with stable coronary artery disease and high-grade ventricular arrhythmias].  The paper gives an original algorithm for the management of patients with stable coronary artery disease, preserved/moderately reduced left ventricular systolic function, and high-grade ventricular arrhythmias from the first registration of the latter to the choice of treatment policy.
Great attention is paid to the assessment of a private clinical case, by determining the nature of arrhythmias, and to the involvement of autonomic regulation in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias.
The importance of topical diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmias and identification of psychological disorders is emphasized.
Diagnostic problems are solved in a step-by-step fashion using up-to-date techniques.
The key point of the algorithm proposed is to prevent sudden cardiac death.
