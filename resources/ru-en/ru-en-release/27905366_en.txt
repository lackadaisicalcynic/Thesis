[Experience of transaxillary endoscopic thyroid surgery].  AIM
To compare the outcomes after open and endoscopic interventions on thyroid gland.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We have retrospectively analyzed 158 interventions on thyroid gland for the period March 2014 - January 2016.
Herewith, 21 interventions were performed endoscopically with transaxillary removal of specimen.
RESULTS
The study was designed in 2 groups - main (endoscopic surgery) and control (open surgery).
There were 2 complications in the main group: intraoperative injury of cricoid cartilage by harmonic scalpel and unilateral subcutaneous emphysema of the neck and face.
In the control group one patient had transient hypocalcemia.
CONCLUSION
Endoscopic thyroid surgery is technically feasible in certain patients, adequate technical equipment and sufficient experience of surgical team.
