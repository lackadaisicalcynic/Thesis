[Vestibular vertigo in hemispheric strokes].
The literature on cases of hemispheric stroke manifesting with acute vertigo is reviewed.  The authors describe a 56-year-old patient with recurrent acute vestibular syndrome due to hemispheric ischemic stroke.
Imaging study revealed ischemic stroke with lesions in a parietal-occipital region of the left hemisphere.  Possible mechanisms of vestibular symptoms in hemispheric lesions are discussed.
