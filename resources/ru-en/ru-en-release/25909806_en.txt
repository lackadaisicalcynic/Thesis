[Treatment of endogenous depression with venflaxine: clinical action, tolerability and personalized treatment options].
OBJECTIVE
To specify clinical action of venflaxine during the course treatment of patients with different depressive states of endogenous nature.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
An open naturalistic study of 32 patients with different nosological forms of endogenous depression (manic-depressive psychosis, cyclothymia, schizophrenia) was carried out.
Duration of the course treatment with venflaxine (velaxin) administered in daily dose of 37,5-300 mg was 56 days.  Clinical and psychometric methods were used.
RESULTS
Venflaxine was a highly effective antidepressant.  In the end of treatment, a "good" therapeutic effect with >50% reduction in total scores on the Hamilton scale (HAMD-D) was achieved in 84,4% of patients, a "marked" effect up to complete recovery with >80% reduction in HAMD-D scores was in 78,1% of cases.
CONCLUSION  Due to its clinical characteristics, venflaxine may be regarded as a multiprofile antidepressant with the distinct balanced action.
In the spectrum of its antidepressant activity, a thymoleptic effect is most pronounced compared to anxiolytic and stimulating effects.  This provides a high efficacy of the drug in different types of endogenous depression (anxiety, apatho-adynamic and, in particular, melancholic).
