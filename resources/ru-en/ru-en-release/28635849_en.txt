[Radio-visualization of non-specific postmortem changes in the cardiovascular system].  This paper presents a review of the literature concerning radio-visualization of non-specific postmortem changes in the cardiovascular system during computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
The peculiar radiological characteristics of postmortem blood clots and cadaveric hypostases in the internal organs are described.
It is emphasized that postmortem CT and MRI can not replace the pathological anatomical studies and forensic medical autopsy.  Roentgenologists engaged in the postmortem examination of the bodies must have relevant knowledge of pathological anatomy and forensic medicine (namely, they must be aware of the non-specific postmortem changes) to be able to adequately interpret the tomograms obtained and correctly establish the diagnosis.
It is recommended that the postmortem CT and MRI images should be used as an additional material for the traditional autopsy, e.g. as a preliminary 'guide' preceding the postmortem examination.
