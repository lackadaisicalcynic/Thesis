[The search of the "intact" structural and functional brain systems as a paradigm shift in schizophrenia research].  OBJECTIVE
The search of the structural and functional brain characteristics is one of the most studied directions in the modern biological psychiatry.  However, in spite of the numerous studies the results are still controversial.
As the necessity of the shift of the current paradigm in schizophrenia research evolves it has been suggested to discriminate not only abnormal but stable functioning neuronal circuits as well.  Consequently, the aim is formulated as the search of the minimal brain damage sufficient for disease development.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Author analyzed the auditory oddball P300 latency (as a marker of information processing speed), N-acetylaspartate level in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (as a marker of neuronal integrity in this brain area) and fractional anisotropy of the fasciculus uncindtus which connects the frontal and temporal lobes (as a marker of white matter bundles microstructure) in 30 patients with schizophrenia and 27 healthy people.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The findings showed that all the tested characteristics are not "obligatory" for schizophrenia.
