[Endovascular treatment of a patient with post-thrombotic disease and obstruction of a cava filter].
Balloon angioplasty and stenting have increasingly been gaining widespread application for treatment of post-thrombotic alterations in the system of the vena cava.
Endovascular ultrasonographic examination makes it possible with the utmost degree of reliability to determine both the extension and degree of the narrowing of venous segments, thus proving a possibility of choosing a venous stent of an appropriate diameter.  Restoration of an adequate venous lumen leads to normalization of blood flow and elimination of venous hypertension.
However, unsolved as yet remains the problem concerning proper management of post-thrombotic obstructions of the inferior vena cava at the level of a cava filter.
Owing to a wide variety of configurations of cava filters to deploy, there are no common approaches to elimination of such obstruction.  Presented herein is a clinical case report regarding successful endovascular treatment of a patient diagnosed with post-thrombotic disease secondary to endured thrombosis.
The findings of both phlebography and endovascular ultrasonographic examination made it possible to diagnose obstruction of the left common iliac vein, external iliac vein, and inferior vena cava to the level of the cava filter previously deployed.
In the segment of the inferior vena cava at the level of the cava filter also revealed was a pronounced luminal narrowing exceeding 90% of its diameter.
We carried out stenting of the common and external iliac veins, inferior vena cava, and the cava filter.
Swelling of the left leg subsided spontaneously within 2 weeks and the first postoperative month was accompanied by gradual disappearance of the previously existing feeling of heaviness in the lower limbs and a dramatic decrease in fatigue by the end of the working day.
