[Longterm survival of elderly patients after myocardial infarction depending on management in the acute period of the disease.]  The paper presents the results of study 5-year survival of elderly patient after acute myocardial infarction.
It is shown that this category of patients, used less invasive diagnostic and treatment strategy, compared with younger.
In our study the effectiveness of primary percutaneous coronary intervention confirmed in patients with myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI) in relation to long-term survival.  However, between the groups of successful thrombolytic therapy and pharmacoinvasive treatment strategy, no significant differences have been identified.
This fact and the conflicting data of modern researches in this area confirm that the choice of treatment strategy of acute myocardial infarction in the elderly is challenging and requires an individual approach.
