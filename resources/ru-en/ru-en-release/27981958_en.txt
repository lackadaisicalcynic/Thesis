[Pulmonary thromboembolism and errors of its lifetime diagnostics].  The objective of the present study was the forensic medical evaluation of the importance of clinical and morphological manifestations of the venous thromboembolic complications (VTEC) for the early diagnostics of pulmonary thromboembolism.
The article presents a detailed information about the VTEC morbidity rate and mortality from pulmonary artery thromboembolism (PATE) with special reference to the possible clinical variants and outcomes of this pathology.  The importance of studying VTEC morbidity is substantiated.
An episode from the personal expert practical work is reported to illustrate errors of lifetime diagnostics of pulmonary artery thromboembolism.
Special attention is given to the necessity of the comprehensive examination of the patients presenting with VTEC for the lifetime diagnostics of pulmonary artery thromboembolism.  The great value of the comprehensive pathological anatomic (forensic medical) investigation for postmortem diagnostics of VTEC is emphasized.
It is concluded that the integrated approach is needed to the conduction of forensic medical expertise of the subjects presenting with the manifestations of the venous thromboembolic complications.
