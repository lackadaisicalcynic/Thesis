[New simulation technologies in neurosurgery].
The article presents a literature review on the current state of simulation technologies in neurosurgery, a brief description of the basic technology and the classification of simulation models, and examples of simulation models and skills simulators used in neurosurgery.  Basic models for the development of physical skills, the spectrum of available computer virtual simulators, and their main characteristics are described.
It would be instructive to include microneurosurgical training and a cadaver course of neurosurgical approaches in neurosurgery training programs and to extend the use of three-dimensional imaging.  Technologies for producing three-dimensional anatomical models and patient-specific computer simulators as well as improvement of tactile feedback systems and display quality of virtual models are promising areas.
Continued professional education necessitates further research for assessing the validity and practical use of simulators and physical models.
