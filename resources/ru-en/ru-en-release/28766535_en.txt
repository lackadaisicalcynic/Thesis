[Adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias: Conclusions of the Russian prospective multicenter study ALL-2009].
AIM  To analyze the efficiency and reproducibility of the ALL-2009 protocol within the Russian prospective multicenter study based on different principles of cytostatic effects (non-intensive, but continuous cytotoxic treatment and a small number of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The ALL-2009 (NCT01193933) study conducted in April 2009 to December 2016 included 194 patients (95 males and 99 females) aged 15 to 55 years (median age 28 years) with Ph-negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
There was early pre-B-cell ALL in 54 patients, common ALL in 101, pre-B ALL in 39, initial leukocytosis in 9.4·109/l (0.4-899.0), lactate dehydrogenase in 901 IU (31-13 059), an initial central nervous system lesion in 17 (8.7%), mediastinal injury in 3 (1.5%), and splenomegaly in 111 (57.2%).
The results of standard cytogenetic analysis are known in 113 (60.4%) patients.
Normal karyotypes were detected in 49 (54.5%) out of the patients; t(4;11) in 9 (5.4%), t(1;19) in 2 (1.2%), and other karyotypic abnormalities in 53 (46.9%).
Thirteen (7.8%) patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first complete remission (CR); their proportion did not differ in the federal and regional centers.
RESULTS
The frequency of CR achievement was the same in the federal and regional centers and generally amounted to 87.5%.
Early (8.8%) and CR (9.6%) mortality rates remained high despite the low aggressiveness of cytotoxic action, necessitating the improvement of auxiliary treatment.
The five-year overall survival (OS) rates vary considerably in the federal and regional centers (72.6 and 43.8%), the relapse-free survival (RFS) (70.2 and 53.4%) and recurrence risk (23.1 and 36.5%) are comparable.
This suggests that the non-intensive, but continuous exposure principle built in the ALL-2009 protocol makes it possible to reproduce the envisaged treatment program and to achieve satisfactory results.
CONCLUSION
The ALL-2009 protocol allows both the federal and regional centers to obtain the long-term results comparable with those of current foreign studies: OS (54.2%), RFS (56.5%); and relapse risk (35.4%).
Multivariate analysis has identified age (over 30 years), initial leukocytosis (30·109/l and more) and t(4;11) among the main clinical prognostic factors.
Gene mutation detection evaluated in a small number of patients (8/36) is not a poor prognostic sign.
There is a need for further investigations with centralized evaluation of the mutation status of leukemic cells and the clearance of minimal residual disease.
