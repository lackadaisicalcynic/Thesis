[Role of assessment of arterial wall stiffness in predicting carotid artery atherosclerosis in patients with abdominal obesity].
AIM  To estimate the possibility of using arterial wall stiffness (AWS) parameters as predictors for carotid artery atherosclerotic plaques (CAAPs) in patients with abdominal obesity (AO).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 132 patients (72% men; mean age, 45.0±5.3 years) with normal blood pressure (BP) and AO, and no cardiovascular diseases (CVD) at a SCORE risk of <5% were examined.
The investigators analyzed lipid composition of blood, its levels of glucose, uric acid, and creatinine, by calculating glomerular filtration rate and performed 24-hour BP monitoring, by estimating AWS parameters, and triplex scanning of the brachiocephalic arteries.
RESULTS
CAAPs were detected in 20 (15.2%) patients.
A subgroup of persons with an aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) of ≥75th percentile (8.0 m/sec for persons aged 31-45 years; 8.3 m/sec for those aged 46-55 years) showed higher rates of carotid atherosclerosis (CA) (44.1% versus 15.2%; p<0.01). The predictors of CAAPs were aortic PWV, average daily aortic systolic BP, and the blood levels of glucose on an empty stomach and uric acid.
CONCLUSION
The analysis of AWS parameters in patients with AO and no CVD at a low SCORE risk may become a potential tool to estimate the likelihood of CAAPs.
When the aortic PWV equal or greater than 8.0 m/sec for persons aged 31-45 years and 8.3 m/sec for those aged 46-55 years, CA screening is appropriate for possible further risk reclassification.
