[Significance of surfactant proteins in the diagnosis of therapeutic diseases].  The lung provides not only respiration, but also the functioning of innate immunity mechanisms.
The hydrophilic proteins SP-A and SP-D are responsible for the regulation of the latter.  In the literature, there is evidence for elevated serum SP-A and SP-D levels in respiratory diseases accompanied by enhanced mucosal inflammation of the lung or its parenchymal injury and their association with age and cardiovascular diseases has been recently found.
Studies of the efficiency of using SP-A and SP-D as specific markers for inflammatory lung diseases are presently worthwhile.
