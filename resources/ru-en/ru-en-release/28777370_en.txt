[Motor activity in psychogenic arm palsy confirmed by polysomnography (clinical case)].  According to current criteria, the diagnosis of psychogenic motor defect is based on the tests which allow recording of movements in the pseudo-paralyzed extremity.
Using polysomnography, electromyography and videomonitoring of motor activities during sleep, movements in the pseudo-paralyzed left arm were recorded in a patient with Munchhausen syndrome and psychogenic plegia in the left arm.
A reduced motor activity in the left side of the body, in particular in the pseudo-paralyzed arm was observed as well.
Possibilities of using movement monitoring during sleep for the diagnosis of psychogenic motor defect are discussed.
