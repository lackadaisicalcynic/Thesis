[Role of AGTR1 A/C polymorphism in the development of atrial fibrillation].
AIM  To investigate the AGTR1 A/C polymorphism associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) to form risk groups among patients who are prone to this disease.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
90 probands with a confirmed diagnosis of AF and their 144 first-, second-, and third-degree relatives were examined.
These families made up a study group.
A control group was formed of 100 apparently healthy individuals without a history of cardiovascular diseases.
Collection of medical history data and complaints, electrocardiography, electrocardiogram monitoring, as well as molecular genetic analysis, thyroid hormone tests were done in all the patients.
RESULTS
No statistically significant data on the correlation between the AGTR1 A/C polymorphism and the development of AF were obtained in any patient subgroup.
The obtained results can be due to the genetic features of a Siberian population, which are dependent on climatic conditions and geographical location, and confirm that AF is a heterogeneous disease.
CONCLUSION
There were no statistically significant differences between the patients in the study group and those in the control group.
Our findings suggest the heterogeneity of AF and confirm its multifactorial nature.
