[Kidney injury associated with monoclonal gammopathies: Perspectives on diagnosis and treatment].  It is currently well justified that monoclonal gammopathies are the most important predictor for kidney diseases, including glomerulonephritis.
To determine a correlation of nephropathy with oligosecretory gammopathy is of fundamental importance, as the treatment of these patients necessitates the use of special chemotherapy regimens to eliminate a pathological clone of lymphocytes or plasmocytes.
If this clone is not eliminated, injury of the organ may recur to develop its failure.
The principles of this therapy have been presently tried out by the example of AL-amyloidosis and showed its efficiency and relatively low toxicity.
