[Antioxidants in complex treatment of far-advanced open-angle glaucoma].  AIM
to evaluate treatment RESULTS in far-advanced glaucoma patients.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 81 patients (81 eyes) with far-advanced open-angle glaucoma were followed up.
The patients were divided into two groups by the treatment they received.
In group 1 (41 patients, 41 eyes) a complex treatment scheme was applied, which included surgical, medicinal, and physiotherapeutic measures, in particular, sinus trabeculectomy (STE) plus posterior scleral trepanation (PST), a 10-day course of subconjunctival Cytoflavin 10 mg 0.5 ml, and magnetolaser stimulation of the optic nerve.
Group 2 (controls) consisted of the rest 40 patients (40 eyes), who received just STE and PST.
RESULTS
The combination approach has yielded visual improvements and glaucoma stabilization in 87% of patients from group 1 by the end of the first year of follow-up, while in group 2 positive changes were found in only 68% of patients.
