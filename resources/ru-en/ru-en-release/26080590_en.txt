[Biointegration of eyelid gold weight implants (experimental study)].  UNLABELLED
The article presents the results of an experimental morphological study of biointegration of different eyelid weight implants used for paralytic lagophthalmos correction.
AIM
To investigate biointegration features of gold monolithic and chain implants.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study enrolled 11 Chinchilla rabbits (22 eyelids).  Light and scanning electron microscopy was performed 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after the implantation.
RESULTS
Over the whole follow-up period chain implants capsules remained more integrated with surrounding connective tissue than those of monolithic implants.
CONCLUSION
The obtained results prove better immobilization of a gold chain implant preventing it from dislocation in the late postoperative period.
