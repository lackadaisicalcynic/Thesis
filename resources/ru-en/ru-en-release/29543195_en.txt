[Algorithm for choosing parameters for relex smile surgery].  Presently ReLEx Smile as a method of vision correction in refractive surgery is becoming increasingly popular in Russia and abroad.
PURPOSE  to develop an algorithm for planning the surgery and choosing its parameters, and to assess the efficacy, safety and predictability of the results in the 6-month follow-up period.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 80 patients (159 eyes) with myopia of various degrees with a mean age of 33±6 years (25 to 44 years old).
Preoperative BCVA was 0.99±0.04 (0.8 to 1.0), spherical equivalent (SE) was -5.14±1.9 (-10.0 to -1.5).
All surgeries were planned and performed according to the developed algorithm.
RESULTS
Results were analyzed 6 months postop.  The average SE after the surgery was -0.08 D (-0.75 to +0.5).
79.5% of patients (126 eyes) were within ±0.5 D from target refraction, 6% of patients (10 eyes) received 1-2 lines of BCVA, in 87% (138 eyes) BCVA remained unchanged, 6% of patients (10 eyes) lost 1-2 lines of BCVA.
95% of patients (151 eyes) had UCVA of 0.8 and higher 6 month after the surgery, and 79% (125 eyes) achieved 1.0 vision.
No significant intraoperative and postoperative complications had occurred.
CONCLUSION
ReLEx Smile is an effective, safe and predictable method of myopia correction.
The newly developed algorithm reduces the risks of complications.  It may be recommended for practical use by surgeons performing ReLEx Smile.
