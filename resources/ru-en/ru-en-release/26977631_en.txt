[Neurological manifestations of giant cell arteritis].  The article describes clinical, including neurological manifestations, of giant cell arteritis (GCA) - granulomatous vasculitis of large and medium-sized vessels, predominantly craniofacial, including precerebral and cerebral, arteries.
Histopathological features of GCA are illustrated by the schemes of panarteritis and «postarteritis» (proliferative and fibrotic changes in the intima, underlying the development of cerebrovascular disorders).
The main clinical manifestations of GCA are described as 3 groups of symptoms: general constitutional symptoms; manifestations of vasculitis of craniofacial, precerebral and cerebral arteries; polymyalgia rheumaticа.
The authors present their own version of the taxonomy of visual disturbances in patients with GCA.
Diagnostic steps in patients with suggestive signs of GCA are described.
Therapeutic regimens of use of glucocorticoids for suggestion/diagnosis of GCA are presented.
