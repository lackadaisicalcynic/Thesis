[Cognitive impairment and compliance in chronic heart failure].
AIM  To determine the factors of cognitive impairment and non-compliance in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and fifty-seven patients with CHF and 32 patients without chronic heart failure (controls) were examined.  Neuropsychological assessment using a 30-minutes protocol recommended by NINDS-Canadian Stroke Standards (NINDS CSS), magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive ERP and a test of compliance were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Approximately 62% of patients did not perform medical prescriptions.
Non-compliance was associated with an increase in the severity of subcortical and perivenricular leukoaraiosis, a slowdown in decision-making processes (an increase in the P300 latency), worse performance on speech activity tests, optical/spatial and frontal dysfunctions and memory.
Patients with non-compliance had frontal cognitive impairment (58%), memory impairment (40%) and mixed forms (21%).  Cognitive impairment in patients with chronic heart failure was associated with the lower left ventricular ejection fraction and deterioration in indices of diastolic function.
