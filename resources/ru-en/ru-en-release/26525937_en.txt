[A trace element analysis of hair in stroke with comorbid depression and cognitive impairment].
AIM
To identify changes in the concentration of trace elements in hair of post stroke patients with comorbid depression and cognitive impairment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined macro - and trace element hair composition of 63 stroke patients with comorbid depressive and cognitive disorders.  The quantity determination was performed by atomic emission spectroscopy.
RESULTS  An increase in hair concentrations of conditionally toxic elements Cd and Pb, essential trace elements Cu, Fe, Mn and decrease in concentrations of Zn were found in the patients with comorbid depression compared to reference values.
CONCLUSION
Post stroke patients with comorbid depression and cognitive impairment had disturbances of the metabolism of trace elements involved in the intrinsic systems of homeostasis.
