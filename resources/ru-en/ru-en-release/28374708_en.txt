[Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with liver cirrhosis].
AIM  To assess efficacy and safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with liver cirrhosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
46 patients with liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh class A and B underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the period from August 2001 to December 2015.
Indications for surgery were acute calculous cholecystitis in 21 (45.6%) patients and chronic calculous cholecystitis in 25 (54.4%) patients.
RESULTS
Mean surgery time was 75 minutes.
Conversion to open surgery was required in 2 patients.
Postoperative complications including bleeding, liver dysfunction, ascites, wound complications were observed in 11 (23.9%) patients.
There were no deaths.
Mean hospital-stay time was 2.5 days.
CONCLUSION
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be successfully performed in carefully selected patients with compensated cirrhosis.
The advantages of minimally invasive technique are less blood loss, surgery time and hospital-stay.
