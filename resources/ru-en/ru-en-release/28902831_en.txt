[Endovenous thermal interventions in treatment of patients with lower limb varicose veins].  The problem regarding treatment of patients suffering from lower limb varicose veins remains a matter of current concern and is important today because of high prevalence of the pathology concerned and a steadily growing number of newly diagnosed cases.
Mention should be made that both Russian and foreign phlebologists along with an open surgical operation on veins have more and more often been using minimally invasive endovenous techniques in comprehensive management of patients presenting with varicose veins.
The present article is a literature review dedicated to a detailed discussion of two most commonly performed and efficient procedures, namely, radiofrequency ablation of lower limb veins and endovasal laser coagulation.
This is accompanied and followed by demonstrating advantages of these techniques, describing the immediate and remote results obtained, as well as possible complications, both typical and rarely occurring.
The majority of specialists employing radiofrequency ablation of lower-limb veins and endovasal endovenous laser coagulation report high effectiveness of their use for treatment of patients with lower limb varicose veins, including those diagnosed with pronounced trophic impairments.
The findings obtained by many authors while comparing efficacy of various endovenous procedures make it possible to assess them objectively and to correctly determine the indications for a particular intervention.
