[Preliminary results of chronic intrathecal therapy in treatment of spastic syndromes of various etiologies].  OBJECTIVE
To estimate the effectiveness of the chronic intrathecal baclofen infusion (ITB) for the treatment of botuloresistant spastic disorders.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
ITB have been performed in 15 cases of spastic disorders.
In 8 cases spasticity was the result of cerebral palsy, 5 - spinal cord injure, 1 - cerebral injure, 1 - pyogenic spinal epiduritis.  The results of surgical treatment were estimated with the Ashworth, GMFM-88 and Arens scales.
These data have been exposed statistically analysis.  RESULTS
Significantly decrease of spasticity have been revealed in most cases: from 4.26±0.7 points before the operation to 1.8±0.67 points after the operation (p<0.004).
In 8 cases we have observed improvement in motor functions.
CONCLUSION
ITB is an effective procedure which leads to decreasing of spasticity, incree of movement volume and improvement in motor functions in patients with spastic disorders.
