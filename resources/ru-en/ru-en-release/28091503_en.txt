[Cocarnit in the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy].
AIM  Study the effect of cocarnit on the peripheral nerve functions in patients with diabetic distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DDSP).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty patients with DDSP, aged from 27 to 65 years, mean 55.3±10.8 years, with diabetes mellitus duration from 2 to 20 years (mean 8.0±5.8 years) received cocarnit as monotherapy in dose of 2 ml daily during 9 days.
The intensity and character of pain were assessed with PainDetect, ТSS and NSS inquirers, quality-of-life was measured with the Russian version of EuroQol-5D questionnarie.
The state of the neuromotor apparatus was studied using stimulation electromyography with the analysis of conduction along motor fibers of peripheral nerves and evoked sympathetic skin responses (ESSR).
RESULTS
After treatment, there was the improvement of scores on PainDetect by 44.3% (p<0.05), NSS by 41.9% (p<0.05) and ТСС by 103.9% (p<0.05).
An increase in the impulse conduction velocity, M- and S-response amplitudes and normalization of ESSR parameters were observed.
In the first turn, the improvement was related to damaged nerves.
CONCLUSION
Cocarnit is an effective drug in the treatment of patients with DDSP.
