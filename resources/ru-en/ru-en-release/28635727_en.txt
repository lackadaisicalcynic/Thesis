[Chronic cerebrovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome: approaches to pathogenic therapy of cognitive dysfunction].
Cognitive decline comprises one of the most important symptoms of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.  It leads not only to social disability of the patients with a subsequent decline in life quality but also to a decrease in adequate control of the course of both vascular pathology and comorbid states.
Pathogenetic therapy and prevention of cerebrovascular disease progression, along with general medical measures, should include the drugs normalizing different symptoms of metabolic syndrome (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus etc) as well as complex drugs with multiple actions (hemangioma correction, antithrombotic, antioxidant and vasoactive) actions.
