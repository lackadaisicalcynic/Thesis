[Neuropsychiatric disorders in dementia: mechanisms and treatment approach].
Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia can manifest at various stages during the disease.  Prominence and rate of progression may depend on nosological form of dementia as well as environmental factors, concomitant diseases et al.
Each psychiatric symptom is based on the specific neurotransmitter imbalance and differentiated involvement of various parts of the Central Nervous System in the pathological process.
Treatment in each case should be chosen individually taking into account the balance of benefits and risks of prescribed drugs.
