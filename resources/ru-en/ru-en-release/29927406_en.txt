[An effect of mexidol on the expression of the transcription factor Nrf2 in the rat cerebral cortex in ischemia].
AIM  To study an effect of the antioxidant and antihypoxant mexidol (ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate) on the transcription factor Nrf2 expression in neuronal nucleis of frontal cortex cells autor the common carotid artery unilateral occlusion.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was performed on 64 male Wistar rats.
The Nrf2 expression was determined immunohistochemically.
RESULTS
Single intraperitoneal mexidol (120 mg/kg b.w.) infusion and oral (100 mg/kg p.w. thrice a day for 14 days) administration of mexidol did not affect Nrf2 expression.
Unilateral common carotid artery occlusion led to the increase in Nrf2 expression 4 h and 5 days after occlusion.
Oral administration of mexidol in dose of 100 mg/kg b.w. thrice a day for 14 days before and after ischemia increased Nrf2 expression on the 4th h and on the 12th day in comparison with intact animals.  Nrf2 expression was higher after 4 h and 12 days in comparison with the control occlusion group.
CONCLUSION  Mexidol increases Nrf2 expression in the frontal cortex of rats not under normal conditions but in common carotid artery unilateral occlusion.
