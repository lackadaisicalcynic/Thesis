[Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in 25-45-year-old Novosibirsk dwellers].
AIM  To study the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and its components in a 25-45-year-old Novosibirsk population.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The Novosibirsk Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine conducted a cross-sectional population-based survey in one of the typical districts of Novosibirsk in 2013-2015.
The survey covered 346 men and 408 women.
The criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP-ATP III, 2001), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF, 2005), the Joint Interim Statement (JIS, 2009), and the All-Russian Research Society of Cardiologists (ARRSC, 2009) were used to detect MS.  According to the ARRSC criteria, MS was recorded if a waist circumference (WC) was >80 cm for women and >94 cm for men in conjunction with 2 of the following criteria: a blood pressure ≥130/85 mm Hg, triglycerides (TG) ≥1.7 mmol/l, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol <1.0 mmol/l for men and <1.2 mmol/l for women, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol >3.0 mmol/l, and plasma glucose level ≥6.1 mmol/l.
RESULTS
According to the 2009 ARRSC criteria, the prevalence of abdominal obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, HDL hypocholestrolemia, LDL hypercholesterolemia, and high plasma glucose level was 42.6, 33.5, 17.5, 24.3, 64.8, and 29%, respectively.
The prevalence of MS in 25-45-year-old Novosibirsk people was 17% (19.9% in men and 14.5% in women) according to the 2001 NCEP-ATP III, 27% (29.5% in men and 24.5% in women) according to the 2005 IDF criteria, 30% (35.8% in men and 25% in women) according to the 2009 JIS criteria, and 29.3% (33.2% in men and 26% in women) according to the 2009 ARRSC criteria, this was higher among men than women.  There was an increase in the prevalence of MS with age.
CONCLUSION
The highest prevalence of MS was 30 and 29.3% when using the 2009 JIS and the 2009 ARRSC criteria, respectively.
Whatever the criterion was used, MS was more frequently recorded in men than women.
