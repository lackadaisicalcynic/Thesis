[Study into ratios of mineral metabolism in patients of different age groups suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee].
A study has been made into indicators of electrolyte composition and phosphatase activity of blood serum, urine and synovial fluid of the patients belonging to different age groups and going through compensated, subcompensated and decompensated stages of osteoarthritis of the knee.  Changes in parameters of mineral metabolism have been detected related to the progress of the disease.
The most obvious alteration was discovered in patients of the second age group having the subcompensated osteoarthritis stage.
Elderly patients at the decompensated stage showed shifts of indicators of the bone remodeling.
