[Neurodevelopmental disorders in children with epilepsy].  Neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, autistic-spectrum disorders, speech disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, are more prevalent in children with epilepsy compared with the general population.
Marked developmental delay and regression of acquired skills are characteristic of epileptic encephalopathies.  Conditions, in which neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with the marked epileptiform EEG activity, while clinical epileptic seizures are absent, represent a serious problem.
The authors consider the features of epilepsy with electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep, pseudo-Lennox syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, children autistic epileptiform regression, autosomal-dominant rolandic epilepsy with verbal dispraxy and a combination of epilepsy and subclinical epileptiform EEG activity with developmental dysphasia and ADHD.
In addition to the optimization of basic treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), nootropic drugs which do not increase epileptiform activity (hopantenic acid), are recommended.
