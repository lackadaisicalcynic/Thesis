[The study of caries incidence in children according to WHO Significant Index of Caries].  The dental hard tissues state was evaluated by SIC index according to a survey of the 5-16-year-old children from Lviv.
The highest SIC index of the primary teeth was estimated in children of 6 years old (9.91±0.40) and the highest mean of the SIC index of the permanent teeth (9.40±0.36) was estimated in 16-year-old children.
It was established that SIC of the permanent teeth in children of 6-9 years old is higher than the average caries intensity in 2.1-2.94 times, indicating the need for a more thorough approach to cariespreventive work among schoolchildren of this age.
