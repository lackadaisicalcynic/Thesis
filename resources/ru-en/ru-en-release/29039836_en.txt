[Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension developed in a female patient with lupus erythematosus and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome].  Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is one of the potentially curable forms of pulmonary hypertension, in which pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is the gold standard treatment.
However, over the last decade, great attention has been given to a combined therapeutic approach including both drug therapy and surgical treatment and the application of endovascular technologies.
This clinical case demonstrates the diagnostic difficulties of CTEPH and the opportunities of a comprehensive approach to therapy for the disease with mandatory assessment of preoperative surgical and medical treatment in order to improve the patient status and to prepare for surgery.
