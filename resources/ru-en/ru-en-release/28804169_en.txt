A cohort study of low birth weight and health outcomes in the first year of life, Ghana.
OBJECTIVE  To investigate the effect of birth weight on infant mortality, illness and care seeking in rural Ghana.
METHODS
Using randomized controlled trial data, we compared infants weighing 2.00-2.49, 1.50-1.99 and < 1.50 kg with non-low-birth-weight infants.  We generated adjusted mortality hazard ratios (aHR), adjusted illness rate ratios (aRR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for health-facility admissions and absence of care seeking for four time periods: infancy, the neonatal period, early infancy and late infancy - represented by ages of 0-364, 0-27, 28-182 and 183-364 days, respectively.
FINDINGS  Among 22 906 infants, compared with non-low-birth-weight infants: (i) infants weighing 2.00-2.49, 1.50-1.99 and < 1.50 kg were about two (aHR: 2.13; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.76-2.59), eight (aHR: 8.21; 95% CI: 6.26-10.76) and 25 (aHR: 25.38; 95% CI: 18.36-35.10) times more likely to die in infancy, respectively; (ii) those born weighing < 1.50 kg were about 48 (aHR: 48.45; 95% CI: 32.81-71.55) and eight (aHR: 8.42; 95% CI: 3.09-22.92) times more likely to die in the neonatal period and late infancy, respectively; (iii) those born weighing 1.50-1.99 kg (aRR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.27-1.95) or < 1.50 kg (aRR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.13-2.21) had higher neonatal illness rates; and (iv) for those born weighing 1.50-1.99 kg, care was less likely to be sought in the neonatal period (aOR: 3.30; 95% CI: 1.98-5.48) and early infancy (aOR : 1.74; 95% CI: 1.26-2.39).
CONCLUSION
For low-birth-weight infants in Ghana, strategies to minimize mortality and improve care seeking are needed.
