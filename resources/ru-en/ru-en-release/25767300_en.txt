Big data in global health: improving health in low- and middle-income countries.
Over the last decade, a massive increase in data collection and analysis has occurred in many fields.  In the health sector, however, there has been relatively little progress in data analysis and application despite a rapid rise in data production.
Given adequate governance, improvements in the quality, quantity, storage and analysis of health data could lead to substantial improvements in many health outcomes.
In low- and middle-income countries in particular, the creation of an information feedback mechanism can move health-care delivery towards results-based practice and improve the effective use of scarce resources.
We review the evolving definition of big data and the possible advantages of - and problems in - using such data to improve health-care delivery in low- and middle-income countries.
The collection of big data as mobile-phone based services improve may mean that development phases required elsewhere can be skipped.
However, poor infrastructure may prevent interoperability and the safe use of patient data.  An appropriate governance framework must be developed and enforced to protect individuals and ensure that health-care delivery is tailored to the characteristics and values of the target communities.
