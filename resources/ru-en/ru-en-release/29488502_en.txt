[The species composition and sensitivity of pathogenic microflora responsible for the development of otitis externa diffusa to the components of Polidexa].
The objective of the present work was to study microflora of the external auditory meatus in the patients presenting with bacterial otitis externa diffusa.
The authors have analyzed the results of microbiological investigations involving 102 patients with this condition undergoing the treatment with 'Polidexa'.
The characteristic of species composition of microflora associated with otitis externa diffusa is presented.  The sensitivity of the most common pathogens responsible for the development of this pathology towards antibiotics contained in ear drops has been analysed.
The advantages of the use Polidexa for the treatment of this acute ear disease are described.
