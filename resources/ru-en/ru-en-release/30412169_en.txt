[The effectiveness of the intra-tympanic administration of methylprednisolone and gentamycin for the treatment of Meniere's disease].  Meniere's disease is an inner ear pathology characterized by periodic fits of systemic dizziness, fluctuating low-frequency sensorineural loss of hearing, stuffiness in the ear and tympanophonia.
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intra-tympanic administration of methyl prednisolone in the combination with gentamycin used to treat the patients presenting with Meniere's disease.
The study included 18 patients at the age varying from 18 to 70 years presenting with this condition.
Group 1 was formed to treat the patients with gentamycin, group 2 was comprised of the patients treated with methyl prednisolone.
Special emphasis was placed on the recording of dynamics of the parameters of tonal threshold audiometry and cervical evoked vestibular myogenic potentials.
The episodes of dizziness were characterized based on the results of comparison of the number of systemic dizziness episodes within the first 6 months after the first injection of methyl prednisolone or gentamycin with the number of such episodes during one month prior to the onset of the treatment.
The results were estimated based on the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI scale).  It was shown that the patients comprising group 2 experienced a more pronounced reduction in the number of dizziness episodes compared with those in group 1 (91.56 and 69.81% decrease respectively).
Moreover, hearing improved by 35% in the patients of group 2, whereas the improvement was altogether absent the patients of group 1.
The patients of both groups reported comparable reduction of subjective tympanophonia estimated based on the DHI scale.  The results of the comparison were evaluated based on the DHI scale (54.9% in group 2 and 53.8% in group 1).
