[Blunt chest trauma: possibilities to stabilize multiple and floating ribs fractures].
AIM
To improve surgical treatment of patients with multiple and flotating ribs fractures.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A comparative analysis of two groups of victims with rib fractures was carried out. 148 patients of the control group underwent conservative treatment, mechanical ventilation, skeletal traction.  In 167 patients of the main group we used advanced surgical tactics based on differentiated, stepwise and combined chest stabilization including osteosynthesis of ribs and thoracoscopy.
RESULTS
Immediate results for each type of stabilization were evaluated.
The most durable respiratory support was observed in case of ventilation alone - internal pneumatic stabilization without surgical stabilization.  Osteosynthesis of the ribs had the best outcomes compared with other methods.
An efficacy of developed tactics was confirmed by significantly reduced morbidity, mortality, mechanical ventilation time and ICU-stay in main group.
CONCLUSION  Surgical tactics in patients with multiple and flotating fractures of the ribs is determined by type of ribs and internal organs damage, combined trauma severity and conditions of medical care.
Differentiated, stepwise and combined chest stabilization by using of high-tech methods of medical care (osteosynthesis, thoracoscopy) improves the outcomes in these patients.
