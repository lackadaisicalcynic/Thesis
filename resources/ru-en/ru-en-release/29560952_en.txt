[Name is a term in clinical terminology].  The paper addresses cognitive mechanisms of nomination on the examples of using proper nouns in the names of clinical syndromes.
The authors explore the names of syndromes in neurology and psychiatry which are underpinned by onomastic metaphors or metonymy.  The most frequent sources of the secondary use of proper nouns in clinical terminology are literature, history, mythology, religion and cinematograph.
A choice of name for a new syndrome is determined by objective as well as subjective factors.  Syndrome names with an onomastic component are based on associative thinking.
Designation of the new phenomenon is the result of identification of associations by similarity or adjacency between characteristics of nominated phenomenon and subjects's features that had earlier received the individualizing name in the language and had respective categorical signs.
The use of proper nouns in secondary nomination allow updating rich information stored in the world as well as emotions that enrich our perception with contextual meaning, in particular, with the possibility of its clinical use.
