[The current state and prospects of the development of cochlear implantation].  This paper reports the literature data summarizing the recent achievements in the field of rehabilitation of the patients suffering from deafness and serious impairment of hearing with the use of cochlear implantation.
Much attention is given to the limitations of the modern strategies of signal processing and the prospects for the further development of scientific research in this area.
Special emphasis is laid on recent progress in audiology including the binaural cochlear implant technology and the electroacoustic stimulation facilitating significant improvement in the outcomes of rehabilitation of the patients.
Also, the prospects for the further developments in the field of construction of the new cochlear implantations systems, the novel algorithms for information processing, and the original therapeutic modalities designed to stimulated the growth of axonal processed of the spiral ganglion and their outgrowths into the electrode system.
