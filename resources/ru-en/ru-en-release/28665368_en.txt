[An effect of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with cerebrovascular disorders on the in-hospital transportation].  In-hospital transportation of 76 patients with cerebrovascular disorders, including those in the first postoperative day, was performed.
Two cerebral hemodynamic measurements were carried out five minutes before and immediately after transportation using transcranial Doppler sonography.
Significant changes in cerebral blood flow in the operated patients were shown.
No significant effect on the rate of cerebral blood flow was identified in patients with ischemic lesions.
