[Forensic medical expertises and the studies of material evidence of biological origin in Russia (based on the materials collected during the period from 2003 till 2017)].  The objective of the present study was the analysis of expert activities of the forensic biological, forensic cytological, and molecular genetic divisions and laboratories of the state agencies carrying out forensic medical expertise in the Russian Federation during the past 15 year period (2003-2017).
We scrutinized the data on the organizational structure and the personnel scheduling chart of the aforementioned units.  The study has demonstrated the progressive decrease in the number of forensic biological and forensic cytological investigations versus enhanced activities of the molecular genetic laboratories.
The volume of work done by the forensic biological department was reduced by 42% during 2017 in comparison with 2003 whereas that of molecular genetic expertises and investigations increased by 6.9 times within the same period.
Simultaneously, the structure of the molecular genetic expertises and investigations underwent appreciable changes.
The relative amount of blood studies decreased while that of hair, teeth, bones, and other biological tissues increased.
The time spent for the performance of expertises and investigations in the respective departments and laboratories decreased in comparison with 2003.
