[Efficacy of serosomyotomy in esophagogastroplasty].
AIM  To evaluate an effectiveness of serosomyotomy in isoperistaltic esophagogastroplasty.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Our analysis shows that serosomyotomy improves the results of isoperistaltic esophagogastroplasty.
RESULTS
Esophagogastrostomy by using of proximal graft with adequate blood supply reduced the risk of anastomosis failure.
The incidence of this complication was 12.2% (n=6) and 3% (n=1) in control and main groups respectively.
