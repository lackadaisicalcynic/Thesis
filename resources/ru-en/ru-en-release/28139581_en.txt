[The paper summarizes data on laboratory and clinical assessment of Corega dent Laboratory and clinical analysis of Corega denture adhesive cream mechanical properties].  The paper summarizes data on laboratory and clinical assessment of Corega denture adhesive cream adhesive properties: adhesion strength and time of adhesive material fixing.
Clinical assessment was based on Ulitovsky-Leontyev denture fixation index evaluated in 18 edentulous patients with full removable dentures 1 and 12 months after denture manufacturing.  After one year of evaluation denture fixation in patients using Corega denture adhesive cream was 8-15% better (depending on alveolar bed anatomy) than in controls proving that Corega improves full denture adaptation to physiological atrophy of alveolar bone.
