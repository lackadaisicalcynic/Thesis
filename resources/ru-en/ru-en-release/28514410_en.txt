[Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis in chronic hepatitis C: Genetic aspects].  Cryoglobulinemia (CG) is detected in more than 50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC); however, only 15-25% of them develop cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV) that is a systemic vasculitis due to the formation of immune deposits, which affects small (less than medium-sized) vessels and which is frequently fatal for the patient.
The causes of CG only in some patients with CHC and the pathogenesis of CV remain unstudied; however, the accumulated data allow one to identify the special contribution of the patient's genetic factors to the development of the disease.
The paper considers the genetic aspects of the development of CG and CV in CHC.
