[On the classification of large and giant paraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysms].
Large and giant intradural ICA aneurysms or the so-called paraclinoid aneurysms are a surgical challenge requiring high qualification of the neurosurgeon.  Despite numerous publications on this topic, there is still no generally accepted classification of paraclinoid aneurysms.
In this paper, we analyzed the definitions and classifications of paraclinoid aneurysms, which were available in the medical literature.  The paper presents our own surgical classification of paraclinoid ICA aneurysms, which has been developed by Prof. Sh.
Sh.
Eliava and co-authors at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute.
The classification is based on the aneurysm neck position relative to the ICA wall, aneurysm dome direction, and type of aneurysm clipping.
