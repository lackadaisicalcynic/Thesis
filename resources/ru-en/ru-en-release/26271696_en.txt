[Epidemiology of teeth hypersensitivity].
A clinical examination of 98 patients aged 20 to 75 years was carried out to identifyclinical and epidemiological features of hard tooth tissueshypersensitivity.
The survey found out what stimuli (cold, hot, sour, mechanical, chemical) cause the appearance of dental hyperesthesia.
The detailed survey of the affected area aimed to determine the presence of dental caries, gingival recession, wedge-shaped defects, erosions, microcracks and chipped enamel, as well as wear of the tooth crown.
Forty-threepatients of 98 (43.88%) had tooth sensitivity.  Most affected age group was 25-34 years (33%).
Among patients studied with hyperesthesia 86% complained of pain.  It was establishedthat dental hyperesthesia most often causes an intense, but quickly passing pain response, wherein upon exposure of several types of stimuli.
Teeth with high sensitivity showed signs of abrasion (74.1%), most often--on the vestibular surface (44.4%).
Patients under 45 years had notable cracks and wedge-shaped defects.  In patients 45 years and older cracks and increased abrasion of hard dental tissues was seen.
