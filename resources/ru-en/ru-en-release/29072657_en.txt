[The influence of biological compatibility of the cyanoacrylate glue on regeneration of the cartilaginous tissue].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the possibility of the application of the cyanoacrylate-based glue for the strengthening of the reconstructed elements of the middle ear and its influence on the regeneration of the cartilaginous tissue.
We used the cartilaginous tissue from the auricles of the male California rabbits as a model.  The cartilage was destroyed in a standard press.
Half of the cartilage thus fragmented was implanted into the left auricle.  The remaining part was mixed up with the cyanoacrylate glue and implanted into the right auricle of the same animal.
The implanted material was used for the morphological study on day 10, within 1 and 2 months after the beginning of the experiment.
The results of the study confirm the absence of the toxic action of the biologically compatible cyanoacrylate-based glue on the regeneration of the cartilaginous and connective tissues which suggests the possibility of its application for the surgical treatment of the diseases of the middle ear.
