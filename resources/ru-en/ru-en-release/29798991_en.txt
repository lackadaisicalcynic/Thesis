[Prospects of combined anterior prosthetic hernia repair in treatment of large and giant ventral hernias].
AIM
To evaluate clinical efficacy of combined anterior prosthetic hernia repair in treatment of large and giant ventral hernias.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients with large and giant hernias have been analyzed.  In the main group (n=675) combined methods of hernia gates repair were applied, in control group (n=257) - stretching repair including prosthesis deployment.
Surgeons (n=22) were interviewed for learning curve, safety, limitations and reliability of combined methods.
RESULTS  Combined method of hernia repair in patients with large and giant hernias reduces overall postoperative morbidity (p<0.001), wound complications (p<0.05) and incidence of recurrent hernia (p<0.001).
Questionnaire data showed the possibility of learning for the method by the most of surgeons to treat these patients.  As a result, some practical recommendations are presented for successful procedures and satisfactory results of treatment.
