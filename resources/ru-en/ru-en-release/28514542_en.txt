[Neurohumoral changes in rats of different aged groups on the background of injection of cryopreserved nucleated cells of cord blood].  The application of the cryopreserved preparation of UCB NCs was accompanied by an enhanced activity of all the neurohumoral regulation elements of heart rate, although the absolute indices in 18- and 24-month-old animals did not reach similar ones in younger age groups.
Also we noted an increase of thyroid hormone content in blood serum of aged rats, the level of which decreased with age.
In addition, there was shown that the introduction of UCB NCs during animal life cycle (every 6 months) allowed keeping a functional state of the autonomic nervous system at a «young» physiological level.
