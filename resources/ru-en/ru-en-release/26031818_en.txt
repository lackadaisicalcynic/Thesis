[The program of accelerated rehabilitation after esophagoplasty (fast track surgery) in esophageal cancer surgery].  Esophagectomy with simultaneous plasty in patient with esophageal cancer is still associated with a high incidence of postoperative complications and long-stay patient in the clinic.
The purpose of our report is to inform the use of the program of accelerated rehabilitation after esophagectomy in a prospective study of 13 patients during the period from 2010 to 2011 year and the role of the anesthesiologist in its implementation.
Methods aimed at the preoperative examination, minimally invasive surgery, thoracic epidural anesthesia/analgesia with local anesthetics as a component of anesthesia and postoperative analgesia, early extubation and mobilization of the patient with the implementation of breathing exercises, early enteral feeding, and the planned short postoperative stay in resuscitation and hospital were used.
Postoperative complications were observed in 3 (23/1%) patients: one patient (7/7%) had right-side pneumonia, two patients (15/4%) had right-side pneumothorax requiring emergency re drainage.
The average intensive care stay was 2 (1-4) days, postoperative hospital stay--9 (7-12) days.
Further monitoring of the patients did not show any long-term complications.
The results confirm that it is possible to optimize the healing perioperative process in patients after esophagectomy with simultaneous plasty by using of accelerated rehabilitation program without the risk of increasing the frequency of postoperative complications. it will provide the reduction of length of hospital stay.
In view of multifaceted and controversial issue the following researches in this direction are necessary.
