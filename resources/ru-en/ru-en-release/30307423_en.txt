AIM  To develop 'Cadaveric Course' of operative surgery for severe combined trauma for students, surgical residents, postgraduate students of medical universities and to compare its effectiveness with other approaches.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
'Cadaveric course' program of operative surgery for severe combined trauma consisted of four stages.
The first stage is theoretical course (2 weeks), the second stage - students' work in cadaveric operating theatre with instructors (5 weeks), the third stage - their independent work in 'cadaveric operating theatre (10 weeks), the fourth stage - analysis of the results and their comparison with those of 5 2-year residents (control group).
RESULTS
There were significant differences in practical skills between students.
Mean time of surgery and expert assessment score were 32.0±9.5 min and 4.6±0.5 in the main group, respectively, in the control group - 46.0±7.5 min and 3.6±0.5 scores, respectively (p=0.03 and p=0.02).
Theoretical background was similar in both groups (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION
Research has opened new opportunities to introduce 'cadaveric course' into educational process, to analyze its outcomes and further improvement.
