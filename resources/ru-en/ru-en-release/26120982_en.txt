[Lipid spectrum changes and ECG in patients with paranoid schizophrenia in the course of therapy with atypical antipsychotics].  OBJECTIVE
To study correlations between parameters of lipid metabolism and ECG in patients with schizophrenia in light of therapy with atypical antipsychotics.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  We examined 42 patients with paranoid schizophrenia.
All patients received atypical neuroleptics - seroquel, zyprexa, and rispolept.
A group of controls included 25 healthy people.
RESULTS  There was a significant increase (p=0.0002) in body mass (in average by 1.5 kg) in 88% patients.
A significant increase in the concentration of serum triglycerides was identified as well.
The concentration of VLDL in the patients with schizophrenia was 2 times higher compared to controls.  After treatment, VLDL concentration increased even more considerably An increase in atherogenic index (AI) was up to 3.1 in patients with schizophrenia compared to 2.2 in controls.
After treatment, Al increased up to 4 that demonstrated the high risk of development of atherosclerosis.
A significant increase in QT interval in the ECG and heart rate (p=0.03) was revealed only in patients receiving rispolept.
In patients receiving zyprexa and seroquel only heart rate was increased.  CONCLUSION
The antipsychotics studied increase the risk of development of cardiovascular pathology.
