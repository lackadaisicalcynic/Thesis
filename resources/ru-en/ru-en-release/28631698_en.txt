[Hepatitis C virus-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis: A 20-year experience with treatment].
AIM  To summarize the experience of a multidisciplinary therapy hospital in treating patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Seventy-two patients (mean age, 49.4±10.3 years) with HCV-associated CV were examined and followed up for an average period of 2.8±3.6 years.
The efficiency of traditional (corticosteroids ± cyclophosphamide) and selective (rituximab) immunosuppressive therapy (IST) was estimated in 31 and 15 observations, respectively, and that of antiviral therapy (AVT) in 25.
Vasculitis activity was assessed using the Birmingham vasculitis activity score (BVAS).
The patients' survival was studied; multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out.
RESULTS
24 (33.4%) of the 72 patients had a stage of liver cirrhosis (LC).
The pretreatment mean BVAS was 11.9±7.2 (range 2 to 36).
Severe CV (BVAS ≥15) was present in 30.6% of the patients.
AVT was accompanied by achievement of sustained virologic response in 48% of the patients, clinical remission in 68% and had an advantage over IST in relation to long-term treatment results.
Rituximab was significantly more effective than traditional immunosuppressants (remission rates of 73 and 13%, respectively).
Combined therapy (rituximab and AVT) was most effective in patients with severe forms of vasculitis.
Sixteen patients died from complications of vasculitis (37.5%), infection (37.5%), and LC (25%).
The factors adversely affecting prognosis were age >55 years (odds ratio (OR), 4.49), the presence of LC (OR, 3.68), renal failure (OR, 4.66) and the use of glucocorticosteroids (OR, 3.91).
CONCLUSION
HCV-associated CV can determine the prognosis of chronic HСV infection.
AVT is the treatment of choice in all patients with HСV-associated CV.
AVT must be combined with rituximab therapy in patients with severe forms of vasculitis.
