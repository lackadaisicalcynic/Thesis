[Robot-assisted operations for non-organ retroperitoneal tumors].
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Robot-assisted operations for non-organ retroperitoneal tumors were performed in 20 patients.
The biggest tumor's diameter was 160 mm, the smallest--32 mm, mean value was 79.1±37.8 mm.
According to morphological investigation data lymphangioma was diagnosed in 4 (20%) patients, lipoma--in 3 (15%) cases, peritoneal cyst--in 2 (10%) patients.  Solitary lymphatic node, teratoma, leiomyosarcoma, accessory stomach, bronchogenic cyst, adenogenous cancer, ureterocele, megaureter, schwannoma, leiomyoma, malignant paraganglioma were observed in 1 (5%) case respectively.
RESULTS
Surgery duration was 138±55.9 min. Blood loss was 69±112.7 ml (range 0-500 ml).
Intraoperative complications (bleeding) were diagnosed in 3 (15%) patients.
There were no conversions.
Robot-assisted variant has been demonstrated in case of non-organ retroperitoneal tumors with diameter not more than 100-120 mm.
