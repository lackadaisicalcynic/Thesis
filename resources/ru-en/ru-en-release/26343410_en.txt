[Microinvasive dental treatment in pre-school children].  The aim of the study was to assess the efficiency of atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) with cavity preparation by means of dental endo motor.
ART method was applied in 94 children (50 females and 44 males, 301 teeth treated) aged 21-96 months.
Wireless dental endo motor (Endo Mate TC2, NSK, Japan) was used for cavity preparation.
The cavities (102 (33.9%) class I, 156 (51.8%) class V, 20 (6.6%) class II, 18 (6%) class III and 5 (1.7%) class IV) were then filled with glass-ionomer cement (Fuji IX, GC, Japan).
Success rate was assessed 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after treatment.
Overall ART procedure success rate (good marginal fit, no occlusal wearing or restoration fractures) at 18-month follow up was 88.7% (267 fillings out of 301) with the highest survival in class I (96.1%) and class V (96.2%) restoration and poorest in class II (50%), class III (44.4%) and class IV (20%) restorations.
Cavity preparation with wireless dental endo motor was well tolerated even by infants (12 children were younger than 24 months), as it is noiseless and significantly faster than conventional manual preparation.
ART method with the use of dental endo motor showed good success rate and proved to be highly efficient in small and apprehensive children.
The method, however, should be avoided in class III and IV cavities as the success rate is poor mostly because of restoration fractures.
