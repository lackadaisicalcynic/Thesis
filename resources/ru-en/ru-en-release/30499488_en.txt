[A clinical and genetic study of impulsive-compulsive disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease].
AIM
To evaluate the frequency and spectrum of impulsive-compulsive disorders (ICDs) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) without dopaminergic medication and among patients receiving dopaminergic replacement therapy, depending on personality type, genetic factors, and to determine the influence of ICDs on the development of other non-motor manifestations of the disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Three hundred and eighty-six consecutive patients with idiopathic PD, including untreated patients with PD (de novo) and patients receiving dopaminergic replacement therapy during one year, were examined.
ICDs were evaluated with QUIP and diagnostic criteria.
Personality type and temperament features were assessed by the Eysenck personality inventory.
Genotyping for the single nucleotide polymorphism rs141116007 in the DBH gene involved in the pathogenesis of PD and ICDs was performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
ICDs were identified in 20.2% patients with PD and in 4% patients of the de novo group.  The most common (10.36%) behavioral disorder was a binge eating.
The frequency of ICDs among patients with PD before the onset of dopamine replacement therapy increased by 1.03 times after one year treatment.
Smoking and young age were risk factors for ICDs (p<0.05).  The results of the study allowed the determination of social and neuropsychological risk factors for ICDs in patients with PD.
The account of these features, as well as early detection of ICDs using screening questionnaires may help to personalize treatment of patients with PD and to prevent the risk of developing comorbid non-motor manifestations of the disease.
