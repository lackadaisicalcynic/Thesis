[Rehabilitation of the patients presenting with the operated spine syndrome during the complicated postoperative period after discectomy].  This article presents an analytical review of the literature concerning the problem of rehabilitation of the patients following the surgical treatment of hernias of intervertebral disks.
The relevance of this problem and the importance of the related research activities in the context of neurorehabilitation are beyond any doubt.
Despite the obvious progress in the modernization of the methods and technologies for medical rehabilitation, the number of re-operations in connection with the recurrences of herniated discs remains too high and the overall success thus far achieved in this field falls short of expectations.
The authors discuss in detail the need for and the contemporary approaches to the rehabilitative treatment of the patients undergoing vertebral microdiscectomy including medication therapy, physiotherapy an therapeutic physical exercises.
The variants of the application of magnetic stimulation during the early period of the rehabilitative treatment of the patients following the minimally invasive interventions for discogenic radiculopathy are considered.
