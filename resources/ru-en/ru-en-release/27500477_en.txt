[The forensic-medical characteristic of the injuries inflicted to a pedestrian in a road traffic accident by the vehicle in the side and front impact position].  The objective of the present study was to distinguish between the separate phases of the car-to-pedestrian collision with the vehicle being in the side and front impact position.
The secondary objective was to determine characteristics of injuries specific for the collisions of this type.  The methods employed in the study included the analysis of archival materials and video sequence images.
We propose to consider a special type of injury resulting from the car-to-pedestrian collision with the vehicle being in the side and front impact position and to distinguish its two varieties.  One of them is caused by the vehicle hitting the pedestrian front laterally, the other arises from the oblique-transverse collision.
