[The role of vasoactive peptid in lower limbs chronic arterial insufficiency treatment].
Atherosclerosis has lead to lower limbs chronic occlusive arterial disease in 80-90 % of cases.  The progress of atherosclerosis is vascular wall self-regulation process violation, and its correction can be made by completion of missing endogenous peptides.
OBJECTIVE  assessment of the possibility to use the vasoactive peptid of Vezugen as monotherapy in patients underwent surgery for chronic lower limbs ischemia.
The results of surgical treatment of lower limbs chronic arterial insufficiency in 41 patients were studied.  A comparative analysis of clinical and ultrasonic parameters of blood flow in the lower limbs before and after monotherapy was undertaken.
Blood flow in the lower limbs after treatment by Vezugen monotherapy significantly improves both on clinical and on the ultrasonic parameters.
