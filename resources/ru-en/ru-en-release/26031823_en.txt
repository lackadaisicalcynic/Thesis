[Analysis of remote results of simultaneous hernioalloplasty and abdominoplasty in patients with postoperative ventral hernias and obesity].  It was performed a comparative research of remote results including local status and life quality of simultaneous surgical treatment in 64 patients with postoperative ventral hernias (W1-W4) and obesity (1-3 degrees).
It was compared advanced hernioalloplasty with new synthetic materials including Prolene-Monocryl-composite mesh and absorbable adhesion barrier INTERCEED (TC7) in combination with abdominoplasty and hernioalloplasty with the same materials.
It was concluded that simultaneous hernioalloplasty and abdominoplasty contributed statistically significant (p < 0.01) decreasing of number of recurrent hernias in 2 times, body mass index and body mass on 24% in comparison with single alloplasty.
