[The specific features of the vestibular function in the patients presenting with sensorineural hearing loss of vascular genesis].
The authors consider the specific features of the vestibular function in the patients with sensorineural hearing loss of vascular genesis.  The study included 60 patients at the age from 28 to 75 years presenting with sensorineural impairment of hearing of vascular genesis.
All of them were examined with the use of the extended otoneurological method.  The data obtained were compared with the structural changes and hemodynamic characteristics of vertebral arteries (VA) and internal carotid arteries (ICA) and with the results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.
