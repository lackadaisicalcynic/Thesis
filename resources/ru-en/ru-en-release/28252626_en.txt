[Numbers of early CD34+ progenitors of bone marrow hematopoiesis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma].
AIM  To estimate the number of early progenitors of bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the late period after high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) according to the mNHL-BFM-90 program.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The investigators analyzed the results of BM immunophenotypic and histological studies in 40 patients (median age, 57 years) with DLBCL who received HDCT according to the mNHL-BFM-90 program at the Hematology Research Center (HRC), Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation (MHRF), in the period 2002 to 2009.
A comparison group consisted of 19 patients (median age, 70 years) treated according to the CHOP/R-CHOP program at HRC, MHRF, in the same period.  The median follow-up period was 6 years.
The results of BM examination were analyzed before and 5-10 years after the end of HDCT.
Immunophenotypic study determined the number of early CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors.
BM cellularity, the size of erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic lineages, their ratio, the presence of dysplasia signs, and secondary stromal changes were histologically determined.
The BM toxic injury signs found for the first time were evaluated as manifestations of late myelotoxicity.
RESULTS
At 5-to-10-year follow-ups after the end of HDCT according to the mNHL-BFM-90 program, the patients showed a smaller number of early CD34+ progenitors of BM hematopoiesis in 31 (78%) cases than those treated according to the CHOP/R-CHOP-21 program (n=8 (2%)) (p=0.005). Myelopoiesis with decreased CD34+ cell count was characterized by hypocellularity in 8 (26%) patients (p=0.07), the narrowing of megakaryocytic lineage in 14 (45%) (p=0.006), erythroid one in 7 (23%) (p=0.01), and granulocytic one in 8 (26%) (p=0.92), pronounced secondary stromal changes in 15 (48%) (p=0.03), and grade 1 thrombocytopenia in 13 (42%); p=0.02).
CONCLUSION
There is evidence that the number of early CD34+ progenitors of BM hematopoiesis decreased in patients with DLBCL in the late period after HDCT.
The investigation shows the relationship of the reduction in the number of early CD34+ progenitors of BM hematopoiesis in the late follow-up period to the presence of pronounced secondary changes in the BM stroma (p=0.02).
There was no statistically significant relationship of the decreased number of CD34+ cells to the age younger or older than 60 years, to the period after the end of chemotherapy, to gender or presence of specific BM injury.
