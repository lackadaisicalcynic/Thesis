[The climatotherapy of depressive states in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AIM  To study an effect of sanatorium-climate therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with comorbid depressive disorders.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The scale of depression CES-D and the Spielberger-Khanin scale of anxiety were administered to 146 patients with COPD, treated in the sanatorium in the south coast of Crimea.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Depressive disorders were identified in 72.6% of patients, including moderate and severe disorders (41.8%).
Anxiety disorders were found in 67.1% of patients.
The severity of anxiety-depressive disorders was correlated with the COPD degree.
It was shown that the sanatorium-resort treatment has a beneficial effect on mental status of the patients.
The best results were demonstrated for mild degree of COPD.
