[The choice of the conditions for the preparation of the pregabalin samples from the biological fluids with the use of the liquid-liquid and solid phase extraction techniques].
The objective of the present study was the development of the methods for the isolation and identification of pregabalin for the purpose of chemical toxicological analysis (CTA).  The authors describe the methods used to obtain pregabalin from the model mixtures of urine and blood plasma with the use of liquid-liquid and solid phase extraction.
In addition, a method for the quantitative determination of pregabalin by means of combined gas chromatography mass-spectrometry was applied.
