[Evaluating the effectiveness of Solanum tuberosum shoots extract in experimental ocular herpes].
UNLABELLED  Ocular herpes (OH) is an infectious disease caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) characterized by a variable clinical presentation and often accompanied by complications that may lead to deterioration of visual functions, cataract development, or even blindness.
Its treatment is arduous.
The aim of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of Panavir eye drops in a rabbit model of OH.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ocular infection was induced with HSV-1 (EU strain) in grey rabbits (all males, 2.5-3.0 kg) according to the standard technique.  The treatment included Panavir-GLA (Panavir-gamma-linolenic acid) and Panavir medications.
RESULTS
Panavir eye drops instilled 6 times daily for 8 days showed a pronounced therapeutic effect and prevented the development of severe corneal opacities.
The most rapid and significant results were seen in rabbits with epithelial keratitis and those with short-term persistence of the virus.
Generally, the effectiveness of Panavir eye drops was comparable with that of the reference drug (Oftalmoferon).  Panavir instillations caused no irritation, toxic and/or allergic effects and were well tolerated by the rabbits.
CONCLUSION
The data obtained suggest that Panavir eye drops may be included in OH treatment schemes.
