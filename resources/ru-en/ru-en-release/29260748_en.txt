[Necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis with clinical presentations of recurrent acute abdomen.  Case report and literature review].
The authors have described the world's first case of necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis (NSG) in a 22-year-old woman with the clinical presentations of acute abdomen, which are associated with abdominal lymph nodal infiltration and necrosis, obvious constitutional disturbances (fever, nocturnal sweats, and significant weight loss), high inflammatory activity (anemia, leukocytosis, high erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels), the gradual appearance of splenic and hepatic necrotic foci, and infiltration into the lung and lacrimal glands with the development of unilateral uveitis.
The patient underwent five surgical interventions, several needle biopsies for recurrent abdominal syndrome, and long-term antibiotic treatment for presumed sepsis, which had caused drug-induced hepatitis.  Bacteriological examination of blood, puncture samples, and removed abdominal cavity tissues, serological tests, and immunomorphogical study of biopsy samples and removed tissues yielded negative results for the presence of bacterial, fungal, and tuberculosis infections.
NSG was diagnosed on the basis of the systemic nature of the lesion, the presence of granulomas with severe abdominal lymph nodal necrosis and necrotizing granulomatous/lymphocytic vasculitis in the mesentery and removed spleen, as well as the absence of granulomas in the spleen, appendix, and biopsy materials of the liver, colonic mucosa, and parotid gland.  Fludarabine therapy was first used in world practice due to the inefficient treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide and to a disease relapse when reducing their doses.
The paper gives a detailed review of the literature on the clinical, laboratory, radiological, and morphological manifestations of the disease, which allow the differential diagnosis of NSG with different variants of granulomatous lesions.  Based on the 5-year follow-up of the patient and on the analysis of clinical, laboratory, radiological, and morphological changes, the authors uphold the concept that the disease is an independent nosological entity: necrotizing angiitis with sarcoid reactions, rather than the entity of nodular or classic sarcoidosis.
