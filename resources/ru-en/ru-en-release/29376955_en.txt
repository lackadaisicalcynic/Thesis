[Pathogenesis and prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in patients after deep vein thrombosis of lower extremities].
AIM  To define the role of thrombophilic and other procoagulant conditions in pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis and the effectiveness of pathogenetic secondary prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic events.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included 107 patients for the period 2007-2016 who were divided into 3 groups.
The main group (n=40) - lifelong individual antithrombotic therapy with warfarin predominantly; the second (control) group (n=39) - warfarin administration for 3-6 months; the third (additional) group (n=28) - specific life-long therapy depending on procoagulant status which was assessed according to original scale.
The main anticoagulants were rivoroxaban or dabigatran etexilate.
Recurrent venous thromboembolic complications (RVTE) were observed in one (2.5%) patient of the first group and in 8 (20.5%) cases of the second group.  In the third group RVTE were absent (significant differences, p<0.03 and 0.001, respectively).
Arterial thromboembolic diseases were noted in 1 (2.5%) patient of the first group, in 4 (10.25%) cases of the second group and in none of the third group (significantly only for group II vs. group III, p<0.01).
RESULTS
Individual antithrombotic therapy reduces the incidence of recurrent venous and arterial thromboembolic events in patients with idiopathic deep vein thrombosis.
