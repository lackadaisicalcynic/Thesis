[Polypous pansinusitis with the deformation of the external nose in a 8 year-old child presenting with the primary ciliary dyskinesia syndrome].  This article reports a rare observation of the development of chronic polypous pansinusitis with deformation of the external nose in a 8 year-old child presenting with primary ciliary dyskinesia syndrome.
The patient underwent multiple surgical interventions in the preceding period.  The key argument in favour of the definitive diagnosis was the results of investigation of ciliated epithelium biopsy taken from the nasal cavity and bronchi in combination with the data obtained by diagnostic endoscopy of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx supplemented by computed tomography.
The proposed treatment strategy including endoscopic endonasal pansinusotomy, antibacterial therapy taking into consideration the sensitivity of the seeded microorganism, and hormonal therapy proved optimal for the management of the given patient.
