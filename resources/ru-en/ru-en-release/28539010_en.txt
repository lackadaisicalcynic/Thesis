Discontinuity of the annuity curves.
III. Two types of vital variability in Drosophila melanogaster.  We confirm five-phased construction of Drosophila annuity curves established earlier.
Annuity curves were composed of stable five-phase component and variable one.  Variable component was due to differences in phase durations.
As stable, so variable components were apparent for 60 generations.  Stochastic component was described as well.
Viability variance which characterize «reaction norm» was apparent for all generation as well.  Thus, both types of variability seem to be inherited.
