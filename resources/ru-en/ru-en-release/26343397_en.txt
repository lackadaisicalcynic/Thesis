[Microcirculation in periodontal tissues assessed by computer capillaroscopy in patients with periodontal disease and metabolic disorders].  The method of capillaroscopy was used to study microcirculation in periodontal tissues in patients with metabolic syndrome and evaluation of vascular disorders in periodontal disease.
In addition to visual assessment of the microcirculation morphometric features of microvessels were obtained: capillary diameter, capillary blood flow velocity, density of capillary network.
Computer capillaroscopy thus allowed revealing the structural features of microvessels and their distribution in periodontal tissues.
