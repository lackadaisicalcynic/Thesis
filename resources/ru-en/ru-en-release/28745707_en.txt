[Treatment of purulent wounds with wound dressing on a foamy basis with Hydrofiber technology].  AIM
to evaluate the effectiveness of modern approaches to the treatment of purulent wounds with the use of foam-based wound coatings with the Hydrofiber technology in comparison with the traditional method of wounds.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
An analysis of the results of treatment of 34 patients with purulent wounds of various etiologies was performed.
Patients were divided into two groups: control and basic.  In the main group, local treatment of wounds was carried out using a foam-based wound coating with Hydrofiber technology.
In the control group, local treatment of wounds was carried out using traditional methods with the use of gauze bandages.
RESULTS
With the use of foam-based wound coatings with HydrofiberÂ® technology, the inflammation process in the wound and surrounding tissues is more rapidly eliminated, the periods of purification and microbial decontamination in the purulent focus are reduced.
