[Direct restoration of the tooth crown using various core build-up materials].  The aim of the study was to assess direct restorations mechanical properties (both in vitro and in vivo) to improve dental restorations quality after root canal treatment.
Laboratory tests showed that using nanocomposite materials of dual curing with the fiberglass reinforced posts improves restoration strength in endodontically treated teeth: by 3.9±5.8% in class II Peroz restorations, 12.6±5.9 and 24.2±4.2% in class III and IV, correspondently.
Using fiberglass reinforced posts (LuxaPost) for the restoration of the tooth crown after endodontic treatment significantly decreases the number of complications associated with marginal leakage of the restoration during first 2 years after treatment (p<005).
