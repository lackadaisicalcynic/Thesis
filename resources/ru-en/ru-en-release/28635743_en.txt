[Clinical efficacy of neuropeptides in cerebrovascular pathology].  Great value in the treatment of ischemic stroke (IS) is given for neuroprotection.
When ischemic neuroprotection aims to increase the period of 'therapeutic window' and stop the cascade of pathological reactions.
The neuroprotection is defined as the continuous adaptation of the neuron to new functional conditions, as the key to reducing damage to brain tissue caused by ischemia, it acts at the level of the molecular cascade leading to the dysfunction and death of neurons.
Special attention is paid to the study of the properties of low molecular weight neuropeptides that penetrate through the hematoencephalitic barrier and exert a multiple effect on the Central nervous system (CNS) even in small concentrations.  One of neuropeptide of cytoprotectors, is Cortexin, containing a complex of low molecular weight peptides (with mass from 1 to 10 kDa), which is optimally balanced and close to the metabolism of brain neurons (organotropic) that exert tissue-specific, regulatory and restorative effect on the cerebral cortex.
The article presents data on the effectiveness purpose of Cortexin in patients with IS.
It is shown that the optimal scheme for the purpose of Cortexin includes: intramuscular administration of Cortexin in the dose of 20 mg (10 mg morning + 10 mg evening) for 10 days, with a repeat the same course within 10 days after the first, since the first 6 h after the onset of stroke symptoms.  The observation period is more than 2 months.
