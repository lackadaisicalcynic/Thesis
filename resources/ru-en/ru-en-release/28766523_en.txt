[The morphological diagnostics of the toxic effects of the smoking blends in the cases of fatal intoxication with pyrrolidinovalerophenone].
The objective of the present study was the development of the morphological criteria for the diagnostics of fatal intoxication with the herbal smoking blends (spices) using the samples of the biological materials obtained from the victims of pyrrolidinovalerophenone poisoning.
The samples were taken from 13 autopsied cadavers of 11 men and 2 women at the age from 26 to 39 years based at the Astrakhan Regional Bureau of Forensic Medical Expertise during the period from 21011 to 2015.  The diagnosis of pyrrolidinvalerpphenon poisoning was verified to the letter.
The materials obtained during the standard autopsy procedure were used for the forensic genetic studies in the combination with the mandatory routine forensic chemical investigations with the application of the gas chromatographic techniques.
Polymorphism of the morphological picture was attributable to the differences in the chemical composition of the poisons and the combination of narcotic and alcoholic intoxication.
The signs of chronic intoxication manifested themselves in the form of mixed gliosis and various lesions of brain neurons.  The variety of clinical symptoms and the morphological picture of pyrrolidinovalerophenone poisoning are responsible for different forms of tanatogenesis which suggests the necessity of further research on the mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of herbal smoking blends.
