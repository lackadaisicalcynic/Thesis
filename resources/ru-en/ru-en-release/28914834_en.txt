[Plasma management in complex treatment of late inflammatory complications after injection contour plasty with polyacrylamide gel].  AIM
To improve the results of treatment of late inflammatory complications after injection contour plasty with polyacrylamide gel.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The authors analyze treatment of 21 patients with late septic complications of body contour plasty with polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) for the period 2010-2015.
Mean age of women was 47.4 years.  Time after primary intervention was 10-22 years.
The depth of soft tissue lesion corresponded to II-III grade by D. Ahrenholz classification (1991), length - from 67 to 180 cm2.
Mammary glands were the most common area of augmentation (18 cases).
Besides antibiotic therapy and surgery complex treatment included exposure with plasma flows in various modes.
RESULTS
Plasma technology significantly accelerated regenerative processes and provided stable microbial decontamination in 100% patients.
High-energy vaporization was associated with maximum possible removal of PAGE from the tissues that was confirmed by histological examination.
