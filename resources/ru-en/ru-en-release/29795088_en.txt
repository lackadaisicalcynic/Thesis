[Resection and correction of the common carotid artery to enable an endovascular approach for treatment of a giant ICA aneurysm (a case report and literature review)].  The article reports a clinical case of endovascular treatment of a female patient with a giant aneurysm of the cavernous internal carotid artery complicated by gross ipsilateral bending of the proximal third of the common carotid artery.
To ensure an adequate endovascular approach to the aneurysm, open repair of the common carotid artery and elimination of its bending were performed at the first stage.
This enabled successful placement of a flow-diverting stent into the internal carotid artery at the aneurysm level at the second stage, resulting in good technical and clinical outcomes.
We discuss the technical aspects of performed interventions and the opportunity of using this approach in patients who need endovascular interventions that are complicated by anatomical-morphological changes in the brachiocephalic arteries.
