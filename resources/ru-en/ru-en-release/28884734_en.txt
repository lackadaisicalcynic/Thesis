[The meteopathic reactions as reflected in the indicators of electropuncture diagnostics.  A pilot study].
The present article was designed to report the results of the electropuncture diagnostics (EPD) with the use of the 'Prognoz' electropunctural device obtained during the examination of 12 patients who experienced meteopathic reactions (MPR) during magnetic storms.
The most frequently detected changes were deviations affecting the acupuncture channels (AC) of the heart, pericardium and triple energizer.
The latter underwent the most pronounced deviation from the 'balanced condition'.
In 2 cases out of the three (66,6%), its hypofunction was documented The pericardium channel was characterized by extreme asymmetry of its left and right branches.
To a lesser extent, a similar asymmetry was apparent in the acupuncture channels of the heart.  The present pilot study revealed the noticeable changed in the functional state of two AC (pericardium and triple energizer) in people suffering from meteopathic reactions.
It is concluded that the further studies involving a larger population of the weather-dependent subjects is likely to identify other sensitive acupuncture channels; the analysis of their functional condition may be instrumental in determining the typical MPR profiles based on the results of the evaluation of the effectiveness of electropunctural diagnostics.
The newly detected patterns may be useful for the development of the personalized approach to the prediction, prevention, and relief of the meteopathic reactions.
