[A favorable outcome of surgical treatment and intensive care in a child admitted in a severe condition in the setting of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (a clinical case and literature review)].
Treatment of children in the acute stage of hemorrhage from cerebral aneurysms is based on clinical cases reported in the literature and descriptions of small series of observations.
There are no studies that enable the development of evidence-based approaches to intensive care in treatment of children with aSAH.  We present a clinical case with a favorable outcome of complex treatment in a child admitted to the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute at an extremely severe condition.
The efficacy of treatment was based on a timely urgent neurosurgical intervention and adequate intensive therapy in the form of extended neuromonitoring with continuous measurement of intracranial pressure, which enabled using the whole complex of measures for timely management of intracranial hypertension.
A favorable outcome (a GOS score IV) after this severe aneurysmal SAH indicates that there are no absolute contraindications for neurosurgical treatment of children with cerebral aneurysms.
