[Applicability of antibacterial agents in chronic tonsillitis treatment].  The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of nitrofuranes applied for the treatment of chronic tonsillitis.
A total of 92 subjects divided into three cohorts were involved in this study.
Cohort 1 included 43 patients presenting with decompensated chronic tonsillitis and having pathogens in palatine tonsil lacunae.  Cohort 2 was comprised of 13 patients with compensated chronic tonsillitis having pathogenic microflora of the same localization, while Cohort 3 was composed of 36 patients resembling those of cohort 1 in terms of clinical presentation, pathogen composition, and microbial spectrum.
While the patients of cohort 1 and cohort 2 were treated by rinsing their tonsil lacunae with a furasol solution as a single-drug therapeutic procedure, those comprising Cohort 3 underwent treatment with furacilinum for the same purpose.
The results of the study give evidence of the important advantages of furasol therapy over other modalities for the conservative treatment of chronic tonsillitis.
