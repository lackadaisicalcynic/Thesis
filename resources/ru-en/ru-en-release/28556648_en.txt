[Compensate restructuring of high cortical regulation of movement in aging at chronic cerebral ischemia].  Dynamic praxis was tested in three groups: two groups of old responders with cognitive impairment of varying severity and one group of old responders sick of vascular dementia.
These groups were compared.
Methodological basis this research is Luriya's theory of system dynamic localization psychic functions.
We found changes of dynamic praxis in aging.
Motor acts some slow in Old responders with mild cognitive impairment.
They compensate this deficit through laud speech, increase of latent period before motor act.
Responders with cognitive impairment have motor perseverations, movement slowdown, which were more often at vascular dementia.
They could not compensate motor deficits in fully.  But same of them can compensate motor deficit after prompting or hit.
