Young and old animals use various strategies of metabolic adaptation to Cu-induced liver fibrosis.
The role of the prooxidant-antioxidant and immune systems in formation of age-related adaptive responses to chronic effects of toxic substances (copper ions) was studied.  In this purpose in young and old animals by multiple sequential administration of copper sulfate was induced liver fibrosis.
Using this model the characteristics of prooxidant-antioxidant and immune systems, and physiological characteristics of were assessed.  The Cu-induced liver fibrosis was accompanied by the oxidative stress and a significant reduction in cell immune activity.
In the case of elimination of oxidative stress by introducing exogenous antioxidants (mix factor) in animals with fibrosis was recovered efficiency, body weight, the content of red blood cells.
In old animals the restoring of the changed parameters of cellular immunity was more effective than in the young.  Young and old animals used different metabolic strategies of adaptation to toxic environmental factors.
