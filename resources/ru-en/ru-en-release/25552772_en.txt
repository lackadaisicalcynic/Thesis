Post-licensure deployment of oral cholera vaccines: a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE  To describe and analyse the characteristics of oral cholera vaccination campaigns; including location, target population, logistics, vaccine coverage and delivery costs.
METHODS
We searched PubMed, the World Health Organization (WHO) website and the Cochrane database with no date or language restrictions.
We contacted public health personnel, experts in the field and in ministries of health and did targeted web searches.
FINDINGS
A total of 33 documents were included in the analysis.  One country, Viet Nam, incorporates oral cholera vaccination into its public health programme and has administered approximately 10.9 million vaccine doses between 1997 and 2012.
In addition, over 3 million doses of the two WHO pre-qualified oral cholera vaccines have been administered in more than 16 campaigns around the world between 1997 and 2014.
These campaigns have either been pre-emptive or reactive and have taken place under diverse conditions, such as in refugee camps or natural disasters.  Estimated two-dose coverage ranged from 46 to 88% of the target population.
Approximate delivery cost per fully immunized person ranged from 0.11-3.99 United States dollars.  CONCLUSION
Experience with oral cholera vaccination campaigns continues to increase.  Public health officials may draw on this experience and conduct oral cholera vaccination campaigns more frequently.
