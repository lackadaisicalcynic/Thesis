[Marburg's variant of multiple sclerosis: a case report].  Marburg's variant of multiple sclerosis, first described by the Austrian neurologist Otto Marburg in 1906, is a rare demyelinating disease that usually leads to severe disability or death within weeks to months.
Our case report describes a young 24-year old woman with Marburg's variant of multiple sclerosis who became totally disabled over a period of some months.
Clinical features and MRI-characteristics of two demyelinating diseases: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and Marburg's variant of multiple sclerosis are discussed.
The use of intense immunosuppression in the case described is considered.
