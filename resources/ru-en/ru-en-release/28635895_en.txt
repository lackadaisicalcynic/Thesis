[The paranasal sinuses as the nitric oxide depot].  This paper was designed to report the currently available data on physiology of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses together with the results of national and international investigations on the computer modeling of the air flow in these structures.
Also discussed are the gas composition in the paranasal sinuses and the potential factors responsible for the changes in the concentration of nitric oxide with the chemical formula of NO in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.
