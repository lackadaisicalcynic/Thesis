[A study of the efficacy and safety of new cephalosporin in the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis].
Acute rhinosinusitis is leading in frequency of antibiotic prescribing all over the world.  At the same time the problem of antibiotic resistance and safety of antimicrobial drugs becomes more relevant and international.
The article describes the basic mechanisms of bacterial resistance and growth of side effects when using macrolides, respiratory fluoroquinilones and Î²-lactam antibiotics of different types.  Formation of IgE-mediated cephalosporin allergy is associated with the side R1 chain.
The R1 structure of cephalosporins I and II generations is similar to penicillins, thus creating conditions for cross-allergy progression.
R1 of cephalosporins III and IV generations is represented by a qualitatively different chemical compound (aminothiazol-oxime group) that increases the level of tolerance to these antibiotic types.
The data of surveillance study are given to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new drug Spectracef (active substance is cephalosporin of III generation Cefditoren) when treating acute bacterial rhinosinusitis on an outpatient basis.
