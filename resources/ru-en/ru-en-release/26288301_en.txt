[A clinical and psychological study of tobacco dependence in patients with alcoholism].
AIM
To study the effect of sex- and age-related features, social aspects and progression of alcoholism on tobacco smoking (TS), tobacco dependence (TD) and alcohol dependence (AD) in the Chuvash Republic.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors questioned 769 inpatients with AD and then performed detailed examination and questioning of 390 patients.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  74.4% patients with AD (82.2% men and 41.6% women) were cigarette smokers.
According to the Fagerstr√∂m's test, 79.2% had Nicotine Dependence (ND), 80.3% smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day.
ND was diagnosed much more often in men, TS in them was more intense in comparison with women.
There were highly significant correlations between alcoholism progression and TS or TD.
Patients with AD had more significant ND compared to total population.  They started TS much earlier, more often didnot prefer a particular brand of cigarettes, smoked high pitch cigarettes.
Rejuvenation of TS onset with the fast formation of ND and AD is noted.
