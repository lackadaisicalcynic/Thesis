[The comparative immunohistochemical characteristic of the pharyngeal tonsil under conditions of different environmental impacts].  The objective of the present work was the comparative comprehensive immunohistochemical study of thepharyngeal tonsillar tissues taken from the children living in the regions of the Republic of Tatarstan (RT) differing in the degree of pollution of the atmospheric air.
A total of 100 samples of hyperplastic adenoid vegetation tissuesdivided into three groups were available for the examination.
Group 1 included pharyngeal tonsillar tissues obtained from the children (n=20) living in the regions of RT with the low level of atmospheric pollution.  Groups 2 and 3 were composed of tissue samples from 48 and 32 children respectively living in the regions of TR with the moderate and high levels of environmental pollution.
The analysis of the results obtained in this study demonstrated that the morphological changes in the hyperplastic pharyngeal tonsillar tissues depend on the strength of the environmental impacts.
The lymphoid tissue was shown to respond to the effect of the ecopathological factors in the form of both non-specific stromal-vascular reactions and specific immunomorphological reactions.
The former are apparent as microcirculatory disorders followed by sclerosis and the latter as the reduced intensity of the local immune response associated with inactivation of its T- and B-cellular components mediated through the changes in the monocytic-macrophagal system.
