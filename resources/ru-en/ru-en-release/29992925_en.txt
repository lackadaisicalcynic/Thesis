[Selective approach for splenic flexure mobilization in total mesorectal excision followed by low colorectal anastomoses].
AIM
To evaluate the results of selective approach for splenic flexure mobilization (SFM) after total mesorectal excision with low colorectal anastomoses.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Clinical data were obtained from the multicenter RCT database comparing ileostomy and colostomy in patients with rectal cancer who underwent total mesorectal excision from 2012 to 2017.  Our clinic policy is performing paraaortic lymph node dissection with 'low' inferior mesenteric artery ligation, left colic artery preservation and use of sigmoid colon for colorectal anastomosis.
SFM was used only in cases of inability to apply above-mentioned procedure (selective approach for SFM).
RESULTS
SFM was performed in 15 (13%) out of 115 patients.
The most frequent reasons for SFM were sigmoid colon diverticulosis, impaired blood supply or inadequate length of sigmoid colon.
There were no differences in intraoperative and postoperative complications between TME without SFM and TME with SFM.
CONCLUSION
Selective SFM in TME followed by advanced paraaortic lymph node dissection and left colic artery preservation is safe and may be considered as a viable option to routine SFM in rectal cancer surgery.
