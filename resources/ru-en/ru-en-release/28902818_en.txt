OBJECTIVE  The purpose of our study was to evaluate both clinical and laboratory efficacy of sulodexide given at a daily dose of 500 lipasemic units (LSU) in patients presenting with class C3-C4 chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) according to the CEAP classification.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The study included a total of 25 patients diagnosed with C3-C4 CVI and prescribed to receive sulodexide at a daily dose of 500 LSU for 90 days.
Efficacy was comprehensively controlled by the following tools: the disease-specific Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life Questionnaire (CIVIQ), visual-analogue methods of assessment separate symptoms; the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), as well as ultrasonographic determination of the thickness of subcutaneous fat and crural fascia.
Amongst the key laboratory indices determined by means of the ELISA test were the levels of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), vasopressin and endothelin.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Of the initially enrolled 25 subjects, twenty-two patients completed the study and were taken as 100%.
The 90-day treatment yielded favourable results manifesting themselves in complete disappearance of convulsions in the calf muscles detected at the first visit in 22.7% of patients (p=0.0485), a significant reduction in the frequency of complaints of decreased tolerance to static loads from 27.3 to 9.1% (p=0.2404).
The volume of the crus of the control lower extremity decreased from 134.18±14. 92 to 128.42±12.46 cm3 (p=0.0006), subcutaneous fat thickness at the fixed point decreased from 1.50±0.53 to 1.32±0.46 cm (p=0.0007), and fascial thickness decreased from 0.14±0.7 to 0.11±0.04 (p=0.0359).
Pain syndrome according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) decreased from 36.45±25.60 to 17.50±19.27 mm (p=0.0002).
The global index of quality of life (GIQoL) according to the CIVIQ-20 increased by 27.7% compared with the baseline level (p = 0.0001), the VCSS index decreased from 6.00±1.83 to 4.86±2.05 points (p=0.0002). as for the laboratory markers of endothelial dysfunction, there was a significant decrease in the levels of MMP-2 - from 178.53±36.30 to 176.35±36.67 ng/ml (p=0.0152), MMP-9 - from 90.84±20.41 to 89.78±20.32 ng/ml (p=0.0394), and that of endothelin - from 0.42±0.10 to 0.39±0.10 fmol/ml.
CONCLUSION
Sulodexide exerting a statistically significant clinical and endothelium-protecting effect turned out to be an effective drug for treatment of initial forms of chronic venous insufficiency of lower limbs.
