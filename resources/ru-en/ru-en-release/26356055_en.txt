AIM  To analyze the results of repeated reconstructions of choleresis after living related liver fragments transplantation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 268 recipients (145 women and 123 men) aged 5 months - 61 years (mean age 16,11 Â± 14,62 years) who underwent liver fragments transplantation in the department of liver transplantation of cad.
B.V. Petrovskiy Russian Research Surgery Center from 1997 to 2012.
Biliary reconstructions were performed at different terms after transplantation in 37 patients (13.81%).
Complications followed repeated reconstructions, the initial conditions for biliary anastomosis formation during transplantation, the results of biliary reconstructions after transplantation were analyzed.
RESULTS
In most cases despite the prevailing complications there is a combination of various biliary complications requiring biliary reconstruction.
It was found that live rfragment used for transplantation, type of primary reconstruction of choler sis, number of bile ducts orifices of graft and biliary anastomoses do not demonstrate statistically significant effect on the incidence of post-transplant biliary reconstructions (p>0.05).
Poor prognosis in patients with biliary complications required biliary reconstructionsis determined by the development of graft dysfunction.  Early reconstruction before development of liver transplant dysfunction is necessary condition of successful treatment.
In the case of graft dysfunction liver retransplantation is unique method of treatment.
