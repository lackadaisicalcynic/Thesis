[Modern diagnostic of agenesis of the corpus callosum in children].  Observations of the authors regarding main MRI symptoms of agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) and literature review on the structure of the corpus callosum in normalcy and pathology are presented.
The authors emphasize that some cases of isolated ACC has been found during routine prenatal ultrasound examination.
In this regard, prenatal MRI is more effective.
In 74% patients with ACC, MRI results are consistent with the results of ultrasound and CT.
MRI has advantages in the differentiation of inherited corpus callosum malformation as well as concomitant CNS abnormalities.
