[Long-term outcome prediction in patients with stroke].
AIM  To create a model to predict long-term stroke outcome using polysomnographic parameters.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors prospectively enrolled 56 acute stroke patients.
All subjects underwent clinical evaluation and polysomnographic study.
A modified Rankin Scale was used to measure the degree of disability after stroke.
Long-term stroke outcome was assessed 1 year post-stroke.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
REM-latency and apnea-hypopnea index are factors influencing long-term outcome of stroke.
Including these parameters into the logistic regression model allows to predict stroke outcome at high levels of sensitivity and specificity.
