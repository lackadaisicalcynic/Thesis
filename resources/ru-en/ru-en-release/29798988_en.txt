AIM  To analyze informative value of radiological examination in diagnosis of acute gallstone intestinal obstruction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Diagnosis and treatment of 7 patients with acute gallstone intestinal obstruction have been analyzed.  Diagnostic protocol included radiography of abdominal cavity, sonography and computed tomography.
RESULTS
Computed tomography within the first hours after hospitalization is highly informative to diagnose gallstone intestinal obstruction if other methods are ineffective.
CONCLUSION
Inclusion of computed tomography into survey algorithm optimizes diagnostic process, clarifies the cause of acute intestinal obstruction and promptly determines the indications for video-assisted surgery.
