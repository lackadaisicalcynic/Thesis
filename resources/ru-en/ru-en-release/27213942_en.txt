[The influence of low-intensity laser radiation on the functional activity of neutrophils in the patients presenting with community-acquired pneumonia].
AIM
The objective of the present study was to elucidate the influence of low-intensity laser radiation on the results of the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test in the patients presenting with community-acquired pneumonia.  PATIENTS AND METHODS
A total of 100 patients with community-acquired pneumonia were available for the examination of whom 70 were treated with intravenous low-intensity laser irradiation of blood (ILIB) by means of the ILIB-405 technique during 7 days.  The functional activity of neutrophils was estimated from their ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium in both spontaneous and stimulated NBT-tests.
RESULTS
The analysis of the data obtained in the study has demonstrated the significant improvement of the results of the NBT tests in the group of patients receiving the ILIB treatments regardless of whether its content was originally elevated or reduced.
CONCLUSION
The inclusion of intravenous low-intensity laser irradiation of blood in the combined treatment of the patients with community-acquired pneumonia appreciably promotes normalization of the bactericidal activity of neutrophils.
