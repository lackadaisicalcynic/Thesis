[The association of hemostasis system genes with the development of ischemic stroke in patients under the age of 50 years].  AIM
To study an influence of polymorphic variants of hemostasis system genes on the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in patients of the Slavic population under the age of 50 years.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ninety-two patients (19 women and 73 men), aged 18-50 years, were examined.  The diagnosis of stroke was confirmed by neuroimaging (CT or MRI) in all patients.
Polymorphic alleles of GP1BA, F2, F5 were studied by a real-time polymerase chain reaction using the TaqMan technology.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
An analysis of the GP1BA -5T/C polymorphism showed that it was associated with IS in young men, lacunar stroke and stroke due to thrombosis of the brachiocephalic arteries.  This association was not found in young women.
The F5 G1691A polymorphism was associated with lacunar stroke.  The F2 G20210A polymorphism was associated with stroke due to thrombosis of the brachiocephalic arteries.
