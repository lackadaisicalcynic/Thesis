[New risk factors of stroke in young adults].
According to the modern point of view, up to 75% stroke cases may be associated with conventional (basic) risk factors such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes, and others.  However, up to 25% of stroke cases are associated with the influence of other risk factors, especially among young people.
In this review, an analysis and evaluation of the most significant new stroke risk factors in young adults, such as genetic predisposition, «small» vessels disease, hyperhomocysteinemia, thrombophilia, «silent» brain infarction and others was made.  Attention was paid to a role of new stroke risk factors in women.
In this review, criteria for clinical evaluation of new stroke risk factors and pattern of laboratory tests to determine the stroke risk were defined based on current literature and personal observations.
