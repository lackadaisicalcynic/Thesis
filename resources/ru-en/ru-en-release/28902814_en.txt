['Life-saving' interventions in subacute thrombosis of crural and plantar arteries].  The authors report a clinical case concerning successful endovascular treatment for subacute thrombosis of crural and plantar arteries in a patient with the only leg, substantiating therapeutic decision making with due regard for the duration of thrombosis and localization of the lesion of the arterial bed.
Taking into consideration the statistical data on survival in case of performing major amputation in this cohort of patients, an 'aggressive' endovascular approach including three vascularizations made it possible not only to preserve the leg but also to save the patient's life.
