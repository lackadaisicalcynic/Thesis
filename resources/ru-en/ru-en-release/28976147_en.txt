[The mechanisms of stimulation of cellular proliferation under the effect of L-amino acids in the tissue culture in young and old rats].  The statistical method of range correlation was used to analyse the correlation of individual characteristics of L-amino acids, as well as of the dipole moments of the first pair of the nucleotides of their codons to the biological activity of the amino acids, i.e. to the stimulation of the cellular proliferation.
The experimental material was obtained in the organotypic tissues of ecto- and mesodermal genesis in young and old rats.
It was demonstrated, that each of stimulating amino acids acts in the explants from old rats to 1,5-6 times rarely, as compared to the explants from young rats.
The weak correlation was detected between the stimulation of the cellular proliferation and physical-chemical characteristics - hydrophobicity, dipole moment and isoelectrical point of the amino acids, - in many tissues, but high and moderate correlation was detected in the brain subcortical explants, cerebella and skin.  However, the moderate close correlation was detected between the dipole moment of the first pair of the nucleotides of their codons and the stimulating activity for the explants of the brain subcortical structures (young and old rats), of cerebella and skin (young rats), Spearman correlation coefficient rS =0,52; 0,45; 0,60, 0,71 accordingly.
The moderate close correlation was detected also for the explants of testis and cartilage.  It can be suggested, that some physical-chemicaland biochemical characteristics of amino acids should correlate to their biological activity, especially in relation to the ectodermal tissue.
