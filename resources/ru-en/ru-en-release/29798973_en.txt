[Clinical presentations, diagnosis and treatment of cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis].  The problem of thrombosis of cerebral veins and venous sinuses is insufficiently studied.
The real incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis remains incompletely defined.  The article presents results of clinical research on cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis, which served as a ground for an analysis of causes and development of the disease.
In 20-35% of patients with cerebral venous thrombosis, this disease remains idiopathic after extensive investigation.
Particular attention is given to risk factors, clinical presentations, early diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis.
