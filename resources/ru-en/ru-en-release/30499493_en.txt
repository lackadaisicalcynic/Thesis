[Prevention of progression of cognitive decline in the first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease].
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy of course neurotrophic therapy with cerebrolysin in a group of first-degree relatives of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients who had minimal cognitive dysfunction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty-seven relatives (mean age 57.6Â±14.2 y.o.) received cerebrolysin in the dose of 20 ml/day in intravenous drips in 100 ml isotonic saline.
The duration of treatment was 1 month.
RESULTS
The positive effect of course treatment on the CGI was established in 77.6% of the relatives.
The scores on the MMSE and MoCA scales were significantly improved in the group with cognitive difficulties objectively confirmed by the clinical/neuropsychological examination (n=27) and in the group without cognitive difficulties (n=40).
CONCLUSION
The positive effect of cerebrolysin on the cognitive status of the first-degree relatives of AD patients, regardless of their cognitive deficiency, was demonstrated.
