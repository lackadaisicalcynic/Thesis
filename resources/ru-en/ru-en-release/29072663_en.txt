[The effectiveness of the combination of azelastine hydrochloride and mometasone furoate for the intranasal application in the patients presenting with seasonal allergic rhinitis].  The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of azelastine hydrochloride and mometasone furoate for the intranasal application to treat the patients presenting with seasonal allergic rhinitis.
A total of 60 subjects suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis were available for the observation.
All the patients were allocated to three groups comprised of 20 individuals each.  The patients of the first group received the fixed combination of azelastine hydrochloride and mometasone furoate for the intranasal application, those in the second group were given mometasone furoate administered intranasally together with an oral antihistamine preparation of the third generation, and the patients of the third group were treated with intranasal mometasone furoate alone.
The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated on days 7 and 14 after its initiation.
It was found that the treatment with the use of the combination of azelastine hydrochloride and mometasone furoate resulted in a more pronounced alleviation of rhinological symptoms and improvement of the quality of life at the early stages of therapy in comparison with mometasone furoate monotherapy.
It is concluded that the patients with moderate and severe seasonal allergic rhinitis can be recommended to use the combination of azelastine hydrochloride and mometasone furoate as качестве the initial treatment.
