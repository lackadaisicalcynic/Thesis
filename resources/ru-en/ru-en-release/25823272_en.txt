[Association of cognitive impairments with carbohydrate and lipid metabolic parameters in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery].  UNLABELLED
AIM.  To comparatively analyze neuropsychological parameters in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) depending on the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to evaluate their relationship to carbohydrate and lipid metabolic parameters.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS  Fifty-two male patients with type 2 DM (mean age 58.0 ± 5.7 years) and 46 male patients without this condition (mean age 57.1 ± 6.2 years) were examined.
Besides standard clinical examination, neurophysiological testing and determinations of glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c),) and insulin concentrations, QUICKI index, and blood lipid profile were made.  RESULTS
The patients with DM differed from those without DM in the lower speeds of sensorimotor reactions during neurodynamic testing and in worse attention values.  In the patients with type 2 DM, the worse neuropsychological status was associated with the higher plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, HbA(1c), total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, and triglycerides and with the lower levels of high-density lipoproteins.
These relationships were not observed in the patients without DM.
CONCLUSION
The patients with CAD concurrent with DM had a worse neurophysiological status than those without DM.
Only the DM group demonstrated a relationship between cognitive impairments and carbohydrate metabolic markers.
Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic disturbances may be assumed to make a negative contribution to the development of cognitive impairments in patients with CAD concurrent with type 2 DM.
