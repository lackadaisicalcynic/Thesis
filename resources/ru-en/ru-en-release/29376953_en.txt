[Antegrade approach for cholangiolithiasis complicated by mechanical jaundice].
AIM
To improve an efficiency of surgical treatment of patients with cholelithiasis complicated by obstructive jaundice through antegrade interventional approach.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
166 patients aged from 23 to 92 years with cholangiolithiasis complicated by mechanical jaundice were enrolled.  Patients were divided into 2 groups: group I (136) - retrograde endoscopic method, group II (30) - antegrade interventional approach.
RESULTS  In the first group surgical efficacy was 79.4%.
Morbidity and mortality were 13% and 2% respectively.  In the second group these values were 96.7%, 10% and 3% respectively.
CONCLUSION
Antegrade interventional approach for minimally invasive procedures is technically feasible, has the same effectiveness as the retrograde endoscopic method and also all advantages of minimally invasive techniques.
