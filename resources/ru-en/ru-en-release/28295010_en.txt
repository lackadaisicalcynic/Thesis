[Deported syncytiotrophoblast and placental microparticles in the mother's body during normal pregnancy and preeclampsia (28 years later)].  Over the last 25 years, there has been new evidence for the need to systematize deported placental cells, by identifying 3 groups according to their size, blocking or passing the pulmonary capillaries.
In group 1, deported syncytiotrophoblast is a viable multinucleated complexes 100 to 20 µm in diameter.
Their common cytoplasm displays β-hCG immunoexpression.
After apoptosis of these cells in the lung capillaries, placental bioproducts directly interact with endothelial cell receptors, by contributing to the gestational rearrangement of the woman's body.
In Group 2, placental microparticles are necrotized parts of syncytiotrophoblast microvilli and organelles 1000 to 100 nm in size: they freely pass the lung capillaries, activate the production of proinflammatory cytokines by maternal macrophages, and cause a systemic inflammatory response.  In excess they become triggers of extensive endotheliosis and vasospasm.
In Group 3, placental nanoparticles (or exosomes) are the smallest structures 120 to 20 nm in size; their numbers in the blood are increased in preeclampsia.  The given materials call for further investigation of deported placental cells by standardized studies.
