In 37 (61.7%) patients isolated ASD with deficiency or absence of one edge was diagnosed, isolated ASD with primary septum aneurysm - in 16 (26.7%) cases, 7 (11.6%) patients had reticulate ASD.  5 (8.3%) patients had concomitant tricuspid valve insufficiency required surgical repair (suture annuloplasty).
Following 17 patients underwent completely endoscopic procedure.  Depending on the shape, size and anatomical features of the defect we performed suturing (14 patients, 23.3%) or repair with xenopericardial patch (46%, 76.6%).
Postoperative variables: mechanical ventilation 3.3±1.5 hours, ICU-stay - 18.2±3.7 hours, postoperative hospital-stay - 13.4±5.7 days.  There were no mortality and any life-threatening intra- and postoperative complications.
All patients were in NYHA class I-II with 100% freedom from ASD recanalization and redo surgery.  According to echocardiography data there were decreased right heart, pulmonary artery pressure and preserved left ventricular function in early postoperative period and 1 year after surgery.
In view of favorable course of postoperative period, no significant specific complications and encouraging immediate results we can talk about endoscopic robot-assisted ASD closure in adults as a safe and effective alternative to surgical treatment.
