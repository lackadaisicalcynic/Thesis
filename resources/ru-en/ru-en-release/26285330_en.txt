[The influence of balneo- and peloid therapy on the characteristics of the hormonal regulation in the women presenting with bacterial vaginosis].
AIM
The objective of the present work was to study the influence of balneo- and peloid therapy on the characteristics of the hormonal regulation in the women presenting with bacterial vaginosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) was used to study characteristics of hormonal regulation in 128 women presenting with bacterial vaginosis and normal prolactin level and 58 women with bacterial vaginosis and concomitant hyperprolactinemia.  The study included the evaluation of dynamics of the clinical and laboratory parameters under the influence of peloidtherapy.
The application of the sulfide-containing siltypeloids was shown to have positive clinical effect on the adrenal and ovarian function and to exert the modulating action on the levels of the pituitary and sex hormones in women with bacterial vaginosis and normal prolactin levels.  In contrast, the same treatment of the women with bacterial vaginosis and hyperprolactinemia causes a further deterioration of hormonal imbalance, increases the initially elevated prolactin level, aggravates disorders in the pituitary and ovarian regulation, and decreases the effectiveness of the treatment.
CONCLUSION
The results of the study suggest the necessity of the differential approach to the prescription of balneo- and peloid therapy to the patients with gynecological problems associated with hormonal disorders taking into account the level of prolactinemia.
