[Dynamics of neurologic disturbances on the background of combined therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes].  AIM
The aim of the research was to study the dynamics of neurologic disorders in the context of combined therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 50 patients with diabetic polyneuropathy aged 50-70 years, with more than 12 months disease duration.
The main group (n=30) included the patients who received 18 injections of Cocarnit against the background of hypoglycemic therapy.
The control group patients (n=20) received only hypoglycemic therapy.
The intensity and character of the pain on the background of the therapy was assessed on the TSS and NSS scales.
An objective evaluation of the neurological status was performed using NDS.
The state of the neuromotor apparatus was studied using stimulation electroneuromyography (ENMG) on motor fibers.
RESULTS
As a result of the study, patients in the main group experienced a significant improvement in the NSS, TSS, NDS scales, as well as a decrease in the latent period, an increase in the M-response amplitude and n. peroneus impulse conduction rate.
CONCLUSION
The obtained data confirm the efficacy and high safety profile of Cocarnit in the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
