[Changes in intraocular pressure after intravitreal injections].  At present, intravitreal drug injections are used for treatment of various diseases of posterior segment of the eye.
Among its side effects is significant rise of intraocular pressure (IOP).  PURPOSE
To study the changes in IOP levels after two intravitreal injections.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was performed on a random selection of 335 patients (335 eyes) diagnosed with choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM).
All the patients received intravitreal injections of ranibizumab according to medical indications.
IOP was measured by rebound tonometer Icare-Pro (Icare, Finland) before intravitreal injection, as well as 1 minute, 30 minutes and 3 hours post-injection.
Injection was repeated one months after the initial procedure.
RESULTS
Intravitreal injection of additional liquid volume causes significant IOP rise, up to 38 mm Hg in average (confidence interval 30-45 mm Hg, p<0.05), with further tendency for IOP to self-normalize.
After 30 minutes, IOP remained slightly higher than the initial level - 18 mm Hg (confidence interval 15-21 mm Hg, p<0.05).
After 3 hours, IOP approached baseline level - 14 mm Hg (confidence interval 12-16 mm Hg, p<0.05).
After the second injection, IOP was observed to decrease slower, causing more patients (28% compared to 21% after the first injection) to have IOP raised by 6 to 10 mm Hg from the initial level 30 minutes after the procedure.  CONCLUSION
The revealed changes can serve as a pathophysiological model for studying changes of biometric parameters of anterior and posterior eye segments and biomechanical properties of fibrous tunic.
