[Oral fluid indicators dynamics in pregnant women by topical calcium-phosphate-fluoride gel application].  In this article the most significant oral fluid indicators in pregnant women have been studied before and after the caries prevention course with using the ternary calcium phosphate-fluoride-containing gel.
The topical application of the gel has been established to result in improving the majority of studied oral fluid parameters values.
In addition the probability risk of the oral fluid indicators impact on the dental caries growth rate was assessed in the paper.
Herewith the influence of the same oral fluid parameters on the dental caries growth intensity has been proved to be probably different before and after carrying out the local prophylactic caries impacts.
