[The physiological changes in the larynx of the opera singers].  A total of 30 opera soloists (15 men and 15 women) at the age from 27 to 35 years were examined to elucidate the influence of vocal loading on the vocal fold colour.
Two types of the vocal load were used (20 and 60 minutes in duration).
In the former case, the participants were examined prior to singing and 15 min after it.
In the latter case, the examination was repeated in triplicate, viz. in the morning before singing, thereafter 15 min and 12 hours after singing.
Mirror laryngosopy, laryngostroboscopy, and the acoustic test were employed for the examination.
It was shown that 20 minute singing did not cause an appreciable vocal fold hyperemia.
It developed after singing during 60 minutes and persisted for at least the next 12 minutes in 12 men and 13 women.
However, simultaneous stroboscopy and the acoustic test failed to reveal any abnormalities in these singers.
It is concluded that the majority of the singers develop physiological hyperemia of the vocal folds after singing during 60 minutes that exerts neither subjectively nor objectively noticeable influence on the voice quality even though it lasts at least 12 hours.
