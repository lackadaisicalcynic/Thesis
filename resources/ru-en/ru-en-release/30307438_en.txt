[About the estimation of the possibility of carrying out of several self-inflicted fatal injuries by the victim].  Forensic medical experts are not infrequently faced in their practical work with the question of the possibility of inflicting body injuries by the victim to himself (herself).
In such cases, the law-enforcement authorities are in the first place interested not in the possibility of such self-inflicted injuries but rather in the correspondence between the character of the injuries and the circumstances of the event that needs to be objectively established in the course of the forensic medical expertise.
The cases of multiple severe self-inflicted injuries in which all the witnesses were one way or another involved in the accident as the participants of the fight with the victim, attract especially close attention and require careful examination.
The authors present a case that evolved into a massive public outcry in which a car driver, supposedly under the influence of narcotic drugs, provoked a road traffic accident and the conflict with other road users after which he inflicted severe stab and slash wounds to himself by five knife hits to the left half of the chest.
