[A review of drugs for treatment of Alzheimer's disease in clinical trials: main trends].
Development of drugs for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), is thought to be a complicated problem of current medical chemistry.
According to current concepts, AD is proteinopathy due to impairments in the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein and tau-protein that results in the pathological protein aggregation in the brain.
The author describes about 130 compound used in clinical trials of AD in 2015 and presents major characteristics of their action.
It has allowed to find the following trends in a search for drugs for AD: 1.  Development of disease modifying drugs, 2.
Drugs, which act on several molecular targets simultaneously, 3.  Search for new possibilities of using known drugs (drug reposition).
