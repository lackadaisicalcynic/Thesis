[Age peculiar by endonasal homeostasis in humans.]
The state of protective functions of the nasal cavity determines its homeostasis.  At the stages of postnatal development and involution of functional parameters by endonasal homeostasis undergo a number of specific changes, the study of which has not only scientific value but also practical value for experimental physiology and clinical medicine.
The article presents data on the age dynamics of functional indicators by endonasal homeostasis of human as buffer properties and morphological features of nasal secret.
These indicators are examined at the stages of postnatal development in a comparative perspective based on the study of the age gradients and the position of the doctrine of entropy.
