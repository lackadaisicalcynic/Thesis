[The optimization of restoration approaches of advanced hand activity using the sensorial glove and the mCIMT method].  AIM
To reason the choice of methods of restoration of advanced hand activity depending on severity of motor disturbance in the top extremity.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty-eight patients were randomized into 3 groups: 1) the mCIMT group, 2) the 'touch glove' group, 3) the control group.
For assessment of physical activity of the top extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity, Nine-Hole Peg Test, Motor Assessment Scale were used.
Assessment of non-use phenomenon was carried out with the Motor Activity Log scale.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
At a stage of severe motor dysfunction, there was a restoration of proximal departments of a hand in all groups, neither method was superior to the other.
In case of moderate severity of motor deficiency of the upper extremity the most effective was the method based on the principle of biological feedback - 'a touch glove'.
In the group with mild severity of motor dysfunction, the best recovery was achieved in the mCIMT group.
