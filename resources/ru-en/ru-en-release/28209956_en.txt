[Vacuum-therapy in complex treatment of epithelial coccygeal course].  AIM
To analyze the outcomes in patients with epithelial coccygeal course (ECC) after original vacuum-therapy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 61 patients with ECC.  Patients were divided into 3 groups: 22 patients underwent ECC excision followed by wound closure by Donati, ECC excision with following wound management with ointment swathes was used in 19 cases, vacuum-therapy of open wound was conducted in 20 patients.
RESULTS
In group 1 hospital-stay was 11±1.9 days (ranged 3-20, Me=11), time of complete wound healing - 14.9±4.9 days (ranged 8-49, Me=12.5), early postoperative complications were observed in 5 (22.7%) patients, recurrence - in 3 (13.6%) cases.
In group 2 hospital-stay was 13.7±2.6 days (ranged 3-25, Me=15), time of complete wound healing - 74±5,7 days (ranged 35-112, Me=57,0), early postoperative complications were observed in 2 (10.5%) patients, recurrence - in 1 (5.3%) case.
In group 3 hospital-stay was 13.9±2.3 days (ranged 5-24, Me=15), time of complete wound healing - 31.1±2.7 days (ranged 15-39, Me=31.0), complications and recurrences were absent.
CONCLUSION
Vacuum therapy improves surgical results compared with conventional treatment.
