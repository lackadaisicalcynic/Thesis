[IDH1- and IDH2-mutations in brain glial tumors - the new antioncogenic mechanism].  Mutant forms of the gene IDH1 progress significantly slower, have a lower risk of neoplastic transformation, and generally, mutations of this gene have a pronounced anti-oncogenic effect.
At the same time, almost all mutations are quite stereotyped (98,9%) and occur in the same region of the gene - R132H mutations.
IDH1 gene mutations is a complex multi-layered process, which is a completely new, not previously described anti-oncogene activation mechanism of intracellular protection.
The reason that there is a mutation in the tumor cells is associated with de novo blocking differentiation processes and development of brain cells in the development process, as evidenced by severe cerebral hypoplasia in patients with congenital forms of this mutation.  A completely new mechanism of antitumor protection has been described - stereotypical IDH1 gene mutation is a gene, in fact, is a key event, causing a cascade of further anti-oncogenic mechanisms in brain gliomas.
