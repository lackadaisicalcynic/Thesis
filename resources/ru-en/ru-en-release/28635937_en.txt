[A role of the MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline in treatment of Parkinson's disease].  The current medications for Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment have predominantly symptomatic action.
They reduce the severity of main motor symptoms and delay the disability and fatal outcome but do not able to prevent the late stages characterized by multiple motor and non-motor disorders.
A search for new drugs, which are able to slow disease progression at the early stage and promote effective treatment of symptoms at the late stage, is extremely urgent.  Rasagiline (azilect), a new generation MAO-B inhibitor, helps to solve the problems at different stages of PD.
