[Daily dynamics of time perception in bipolar II disorder patients with redarted or anxious depression].  AIM
It is known affective disorders are changing the perception of time.  The study of time perception in patients with affective disorders enables researchers to make early diagnostic criteria for these conditions, as well as to shed light on possible mechanisms for the development of affective disorders.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
20 patients with bipolar affective disorder type II in accordance with the DSM-5 criteria (10 patients with a predominance of anxiety and 10 patients with a predominance of psychomotor retardation) and 10 healthy subjects were recruited to the study.
Test for measuring minute was conducted from 7 hours to 21 hours with an interval of 2 hours.
Patients were distributed into two experimental groups in accordance with the severity ratio of psychomotor retardation and anxiety.
All patients were on monotherapy with agomelatine in a single dose 25-50 mg/day.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Duration of individual minute, was significantly shorter in the experimental groups compared with the control group and did not differ within experimental groups.
In the group of healthy volunteers length of individual minutes was close to Â«AIM: minute, i.e. 60 seconds, in groups of patients with prevalence of anxiety and a predominance of psychomotor retardation length of individual minutes was set to about 40 seconds and did not differ significantly in patients groups.
In patients with retarded depression distribution of a minute duration peaks was shifted for 2 hours late (13-17 h) comparing to controls, in anxious depresssion the distribution was bimodal with peaks in 10 and 18 hours.
There were no singnificant differences between groups.
Shorter duration of individual minute in patients with recurrent depressive episodes, may be an early sign of a new depressive episode.
