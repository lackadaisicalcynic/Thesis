Postgraduate training for trauma prevention, injury surveillance and research, Uganda.  Problem
The burden of trauma and injuries in Uganda is substantial and growing.  Two important gaps that need addressing are the shortage of trained people and a lack of national data on noncommunicable diseases and their risk factors in Uganda.
Approach
We developed and implemented a new track within an existing master of public health programme, aimed at developing graduate-level capacity and promoting research on key national priorities for trauma and injuries.  We also offered training opportunities to a wider audience and set up a high-level national injury forum to foster national dialogue on addressing the burden of trauma, injuries and disability.
Local setting
The Chronic Consequences of Trauma, Injuries and Disability in Uganda programme was implemented in 2012 at Makerere University School of Public Health in Kampala, Uganda, in conjunction with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, United States of America.
Relevant changes  Over the years 2012 to 2017 we supported four cohorts of master's students, with a total of 14 students (9 females and 5 males; mean age 30 years).
Over 1300 individuals participated in workshops and seminars of the short-term training component of the programme.  The forum hosted three research symposia and two national injury forums.
Lessons learnt
Institutional support and collaborative engagement is important for developing and implementing successful capacity development programmes.
Integration of training components within existing academic structures is key to sustainability.
Appropriate mentorship for highly motivated and talented students is valuable for guiding students through the programme.
