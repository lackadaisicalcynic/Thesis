[Hybrid intervention for a multilevel aneurysmatic lesion of the aorta in a patient with multifocal atherosclerosis].
A multilevel aneurysmatic lesion of the aorta is a rare pathology.  The authors describe herein a clinical case report regarding stage-wise treatment of a patient presenting with aneurysms of the thoracic and abdominal portions of the aorta and a haemodynamically significant lesion of coronary and carotid arteries.
Strategy of surgical management was decided upon collegially.  Successful endoprosthetic repair of the aneurysm of the thoracic portion of the aorta required closure of the left carotid artery with a graft, which, taking into consideration an existing occlusion of the right internal carotid artery, demanded preliminary carotid-subclavian bypass grafting.
The clinical course of progressing angina pectoris (75% stenosis of the anterior descending artery with a poststenotic aneurysm) also increased the risk of the surgical stage.
The authors provide a detailed description of the planning procedure, stages, and technical aspects of the operations performed.
No complications were encountered.
The duration of the follow up period amounted to 15 months.
There was regression of the symptomatic manifestations, accompanied and followed by complete thrombosis of the aneurysmatic zones stented.
A hybrid approach demonstrated efficacy and safety in staged treatment of complicated combined pathology of the aorta and its branches.
