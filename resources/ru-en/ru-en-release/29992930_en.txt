[Modern approaches to components of therapy of patients with diabetes mellitus operated on for malignant neoplasms of small pelvic organs].  The purpose of this study was assessment of the effect of cytoflavin preparation inclusion in surgical treatment of patients with malignant neoplasms of small pelvic organs and diabetes mellitus.
A prospective examination of 51 patients aged 56 to 76 years suffering from diabetes mellitus and malignant neoplasms of the pelvic organs was performed.  Patients were divided into two groups: the first group consisted of 27 patients whose adaptive potential was characterized by tension of adaptation mechanisms, the second one - 24 patients with poor adaptation.
In turn, in each group, patients were divided into subgroups depending on the treatment regimen: in the main subgroup of the first group (14 people) the treatment program was supplemented with cytoflavin (10 ml 2 times a day), in the main subgroup of the second group were 13 patients with cytoflavin supplement (20 ml 2 times a day).  Patients of control groups underwent standard therapy.
Concentration of glucose, lactate, lactate dehydrogenase was assessed.  The results of the study showed clear relationship between the nature of changes in transport and oxygen consumption, adaptation adaptive reactions, allowing to identify mechanisms that characterize formation of various types of energy deficiency in perioperative period in patients with malignant diseases of the pelvic organs and diabetes.
Use of cytoflavin contributed to a qualitative and effective correction of energy deficiency as well as reduction in the patients stay in the hospital.
