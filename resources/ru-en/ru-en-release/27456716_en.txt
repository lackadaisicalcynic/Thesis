[Features of the dynamics of clinical types of developmental delay in preschool children with residual brain damage].
AIM  To study the features of the dynamics of different clinical variants of developmental delay (DD) in preschoolers with residual brain damage and analyze the relationship of these types with disease course and prognosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty-six children (76 boys and 10 girls), aged 3-6 years, were examined.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The following clinical variants have been described: DD with speech impairments (motor and sensory-motor alalia); DD with hyperdynamic syndrome; DD with autistic syndrome; DD with affective instability syndrome; DD with neurotic syndromes (cerebroasthenic syndrome and other neurotic-like conditions).
It is assumed that a poor prognosis in preschool children with developmental delay is associated with manifestations of the autisticand alalia syndromes.
