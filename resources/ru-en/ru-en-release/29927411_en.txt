[A rare variant in the sortilin-related receptor 1 gene is associated with declined cognitive functions in the elderly].  AIM
To estimate the association of rs11218343 in the sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) gene with cognitive performance in the elderly and with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Russian population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A sample included 586 elderly people (mean age 70.9±5.7 years) without AD diagnosis and 100 patients with late-onset AD (mean age 72.1±7.8 years) from the Tomsk population.
SORL1 rs11218343 was genotyped using PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
Cognitive performance in the sample of elderly without AD was assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.
RESULTS
Allele frequencies of the SORL1 polymorphism were not significantly different between the elderly without AD and AD patients.
However mean MoCA score in the carriers of the rare allele (19.00±6.61) was significantly lower than in homozygotes for the common variant (22.25±3.89) (F=4.97; p=0.026).
CONCLUSION
The rare variant in SORL1 gene previously associated with AD in genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses was associated with lower total МоСА scores in the random sample of elderly people that suggests declined cognitive functions in the carriers of this variant in elderly.
