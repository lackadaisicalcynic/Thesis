[The morphological features of a 20 mcl blood stain].  The objective of this work was to study blood stains of small volume (20 mcl).
It was shown that the fall of a blood droplet from the height of 5 to 200 cm at the angle of 90 degrees on a smooth non-absorbing surface (glass) leaves round stains.
Their size increases with increasing height of the fall.
The character of the stain edges also depends on the height of the fall.
The edges are even when the drops fall from the height of less than 20 cm but become wave-shaped with blunt projections when the height of the fall is increased to 30-90 cm.
The fall from the height of 100 to 200 cm gives rise to the stains with the scalloped edges having the rectangular or nearly rectangular protrusions.
From one to three additional Plateau drops can be observed near the main one.
