[Endoscopic retro-muscular alloplasty for primary and postoperative ventral hernias: our initial experience].  AIM
To define optimal surgical approach for middle primary and postoperative ventral hernias.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  We have presented the first results of endoscopic retro-muscular alloplasty in 8 patients with umbilical hernia and postoperative ventral hernia combined with rectus abdominis muscles diastase.
RESULTS
One patient had seroma above mesh implant that was evacuated under ultrasonic control.
Absent hernial protrusion and reduced diastase were noted in all patients.
There were no symptoms of recurrence, purulent-septic complications and venous thromboembolic complications.
Mortality was absent.
CONCLUSION
Further experience and analysis of long-term results are necessary to determine the role of this technique in anterior abdominal wall hernias management.
