[Shereshevsky-Turner syndrome: Estrogen replacement therapy and cardiovascular risk factors].
AIM  To investigate the impact of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on the expression of risk factors for cardiovascular events (CVEs) in patients with Shereshevsky-Turner syndrome (STS); to elaborate an algorithm for patient management using MHT.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
From 2010 to 2012, a total of 41 patients aged 14 to 35 years with STS were examined in the framework of a prospective observational study. 100 STS case histories in 2000 to 2009 were retrospectively analyzed.
The indicators of the so-called cardiometabolic risk, such as body mass index (BMI), lipidogram readings, venous plasma glucose levels, and blood pressure, were estimated in relation to the type of MHT.
In the prospective part of the investigation, an angioscan was used to estimate vessel characteristics (stiffness, wall tone, endothelial function (EF)), by using the examination data.
RESULTS
90% of the patients with STS were found to have risk factors for CVEs: atherogenic dyslipidemia (85%; 51% in the general female population of the same age), diastolic hypertension (36%; no more than 5% that is not typical for age-matched healthy general female population).
In addition to increased arterial wall stiffness (AWS), obvious EF disorder is typical for STS patients.
MHT was accompanied by a dose-dependent (estradiol, at least 2 mg) reduction in diastolic blood pressure by an average of 13% over 24 months, an increase in high density lipoprotein levels by more than 10% over 24 months and also contributedto a decrease in AWS and an improvement in EF.
CONCLUSION
By favorably affecting the EF of vessels and reducing the severity of atherogenic dyslipidemia, MHT potentially enables a reduction in CV risk in patients with STS.
