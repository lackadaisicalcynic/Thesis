[Surgical treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments with high risk of proliferative vitreoretinopathy].  AIM  to analyze the effect of internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in patients undergoing 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy for the treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) with a high risk of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
This was a prospective consecutive study of 231 eyes of 227 patients.
All eyes underwent vitrectomy with silicone oil/gas tamponade for RRD with a high risk of PVR: in 42 eyes the ILM was peeled (group 1) and in the remaining 189 eyes - was not (group 2).
The follow-up period was at least 3 months.
RESULTS
In group 1, single-surgery anatomic success was achieved in 85.4% and definitive reattachment - in 95.2% of patients.
In group 2, single-surgery anatomic success was achieved in 67.2% and definitive reattachment - in 89.4% of patients.
None of the patients from group 1, who had their ILM peeled, developed epiretinal membrane.
Final BCVA in groups 1 and 2 was 1.2±0.5 logMAR and 1.34±0.82 logMAR respectively (p=0.297).
CONCLUSION
ILM peeling during vitrectomy in RRD patients at high risk of PVR provides high primary anatomic success rate.
