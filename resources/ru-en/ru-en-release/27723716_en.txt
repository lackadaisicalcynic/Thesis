[Gait disorders and postural instability in patients with an essential tremor].
AIM  To study gait disorders and postural instability in patients with essential tremor (ET).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty patients with ET, aged from 29 to 82 years, (mean 64.2Â±13.0) were examined.
Tandem walk, tremor, stability and stabilometry were studied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A half of the patients had gait disorders and postural instability.  Though these disorders were mild to moderate, they caused significant subjective discomfort and influenced quality of life.
The results suggest the involvement of the cerebellum in the pathogenesis of gait disorders and postural instability in ET.
