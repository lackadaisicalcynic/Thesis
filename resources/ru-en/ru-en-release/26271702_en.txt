[EMG functional changes in masticatory muscles by elastopositioner use in patients with TMJ dysfunction].  The analysis of the results of EMG studies in patients with TMJ dysfunction was carried out before and after use of elastpositioner "Corrector".
The study revealed significant functional disturbances of the masticatory muscles, which were corrected after applying elastpositioner: there was a trend to decreased activity of masseter and temporal muscles, especially in the stag–µ of rest.
