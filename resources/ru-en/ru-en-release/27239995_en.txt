[Dynamics of tooth decay prevalence in children receiving long-term preventive program in school dental facilities].  The paper presents the assessment of tooth decay prevalence in clinically homogenous groups of children receiving long-term preventive program (PP) in school dental facilities.
Five-years PP were introduced in clinical practice in 2 Moscow schools.
Preventive treatment was performed by dental hygienist.
The results show that systematic preventive treatment in school dental offices starting from elementary school allows reducing dental caries incidence 46-53% and stabilize the incidence of caries complications.  It should be mentioned though that analysis of individualized outcomes proves heterogeneity of study results despite of equal conditions of PP.
Potentially significant hence is early diagnostics and treatment of initial caries forms as demineralization foci, especially in children with intensive tooth decay.  Optimization of pediatric dentist and dental hygienist activity in school dental facilities is the main factor of caries prevention efficiency.
