AIM  to compare long-term results after 2 types of stage management of obstructing colonic cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Main group included 105 patients after staged treatment with decompressive colostomy followed by radical surgery at the second stage.  Control group consisted of 115 patients after obstructive colonic resection with colostomy as radical intervention at the first stage; the second stage included reconstructive intervention colostomy removal.
RESULTS
Local recurrences were observed in 5.1% and 13.7% in the main and control groups respectively.
Distant metastases occurred in 7.1% and 13.7% in both groups respectively.
5-year overall survival was 69.4% and 50.9% in the main and control groups respectively.  Recurrence-free sirvival was 65.3% and 48.1% in both groups.
CONCLUSION
Decompressive colostomy and delayed radical surgery with intestinal integrity restoration improve long-term outcomes compared with emergency radical interventions.
