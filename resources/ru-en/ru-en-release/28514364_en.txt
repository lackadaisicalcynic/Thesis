[Radiodiagnostics of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis].
The objective of the present study was to analyze the potential of such techniques as X-ray, multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT), and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for diagnostics of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis.  The secondary objective was to describe changes in maxillary sinuses identifiable with the help of the above methods.
The study included 166 patients at the age varying from 21 to 81 years presenting with odontogenic maxillary sinusitis.  All of them underwent the roentgenological examination.
The study has demonstrated the low effectiveness of the projection radiography techniques.  The use of computed tomography made it possible to verify the diagnosis in 110 (66.2%) of the 166 examined patients, to reveal the radiological characteristics of the deyected changes suggesting their odontogenic etiology, and to choose the proper strategy for the further treatment.
It is concluded that MSCT and CBCT are the most informative methods to be used for diagnostics of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis.
