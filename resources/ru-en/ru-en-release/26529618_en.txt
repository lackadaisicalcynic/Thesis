[Combined treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations.  Experience of the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute].
OBJECTIVE  Despite the achievements of recent years, cerebral AVMs continue to pose a challenge to treatment.
The objective of this work was the development of recommendations for combined treatment of AVMs based on analysis of the available material and published data.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 93 patients hospitalized at the Neurosurgical Institute for combined treatment of cerebral AVMs in 2010-2014.  A group of combined surgery (removal of an AVM with preoperative embolization) consisted of 40 patients, and a group of combined radiotherapy (radiation after partial embolization or partial removal of an AVM) included 53 patients.
36 patients underwent radiosurgery, and 17 patients received stereotactic radiation therapy.
Both groups were analyzed in terms of outcomes, complications, and follow-up results.
RESULTS
In the group of combined surgery, according to the Glasgow outcome scale, good results (grade 4-5) were achieved in 35 (87.5%) patients at discharge and in 27 (90%) patients during follow-up.
Treatment outcomes, surgery duration, and the amount of blood loss were not significantly different from those in the control group.
Complete AVM obliteration was achieved in 29 (80.6%) patients 3 years after radiosurgery and in 8 (47%) patients after stereotactic radiotherapy.
In discussion, these findings are compared to the published data, and recommendations for AVM treatment are suggested.
CONCLUSION
The combined treatment of AVMs is effective management for patients with complex AVMs (Spetzler-Martin grade III-IV AVMs).
Successful treatment of AVMs requires careful planning and teamwork of vascular and endovascular neurosurgeons, radiologists, and neurologists.
