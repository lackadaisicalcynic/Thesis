[Evaluation of main and additional root canal curvature in maxillary molars].
The aim of the study was to investigate the degree of the main and additional root canal curvatures of the maxillary molars in Krasnoyarsk population.
Main and additional root canal curvature was measured in 48 maxillary first molars (M1) and 122 second molars (M2) with cone beam computer tomography.
In total 476 measurements were taken for M1 and 1038 for M2 (all measurements were doubled in sagittal and coronal views).
M2 showed more variety of root canal morphology and significantly higher proportion of additional root canals.
Curvature rates of M1 did not differ significantly from M2.
Additional root canals had close or similar curvature rates with the main ones.
The obtained data are useful for the improvement of root canal treatment efficacy and endodontic treatment planning.
