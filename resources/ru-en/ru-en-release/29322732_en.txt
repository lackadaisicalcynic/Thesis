[Functional cumulation of influence of vascular peptide bioregulator on microcirculation in the brain cortex of spontaneously hypertensive rats.]
We investigated the influence of vascular peptide bioregulator on microcirculation in the brain cortex of spontaneously hypertensive rats of different ages and figured out whether there is functional cumulation during two-time application of the drug «Slavinorm» by above-mentioned animals.
It was shown that a single course treatment with vascular peptide bioregulator had increased the density of microvascular network of the pia mater in young animals ca. 1,2-fold and had not affected the perfusion and oxygen saturation of sensorimotor cortex.  The second course treatment with «Slavinorm» was provided in a 6 months.
Functional cumulation was revealed in 12 month-aged rats which had 2 course treatments with vascular peptide bioregulation: the density of microvascular network of the pia mater was increased ca. 1,6-fold; level of perfusion was increased ca. 15% in comparison with intact animals of the same age.  These animals were more tolerant to cerebral vasospasm (the application of vasoconstrictor on the surface of the brain): the highest level of tissue oxygen saturation was remained at fairly constant perfusion in comparison with other animals.
