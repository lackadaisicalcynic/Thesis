[The effectiveness of topical antihistamine monotherapy in the patients presenting with the manifestations of seasonal allergic rhinitis].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of monotherapy with the use of allergoferon gel composed of topical recombinant human interferon-α-2β and loratadine.
A total of 105 patients at the age varying from 18 to 55 years presenting with the manifest form of seasonal allergic rhinitis were available for the examination.  They were given the topical treatment in the recommended standard doses.  The patients included in group 1 (n=65) were treated with allergoferon while those comprising group 3 (n=40) received mometasonefuorate (nasonex).
Changes in the clinical symptoms were recorded on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28.
The best results of the treatment were documented in the patients of group 1 on day 3 afterthe onset of therapy; this effect was attributed to the rapid beginning of the drug action that was apparent within15 minutes after the topical application of the medication.
There were no significant difference between the manifestations of the symptoms on days 7 and 14 in the patients of both groups.  None of the patients in group 1 refused to continue therapy up to day 28.
Two patients in group 2 (5%) wished to discontinue the treatment due to side effects.  It is concluded that the treatment with the allergoferon gel for the topical and external applications extends the possibilities for efficacious and safe therapy of the clinical manifestations of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
