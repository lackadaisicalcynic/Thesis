[Pathomorphology of the ventricular germinal zone and neocortex in newborn infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus].
AIM  Ð¢o study the morphological features of the ventricular germinal zone and neocortex in newborns at 22-40 weeks' gestation with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The brains of fetuses and newborns at 22-40 weeks' gestation with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (n=12) were examined; a control group included the brains with a lateral ventricle lumen width of not more than 0.5 cm (n=30).
The investigators conducted a comprehensive pathomorphological study of the ventricular germinal zone and neocortex in the projection field No.
6.  RESULTS
Posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus is characterized by a deceleration in the reduction of the ventricular germinal zone and by the corresponding level of differentiation of the cortex and neurons to gestational age in the presence of the physiological expression of reelin in the Cajal-Retzius neurons and in that of the impaired expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (a decrease) and the glial protein S-100 (an increase) in the cells of the ventricular germinal zone.
CONCLUSION
The morphological features of the ventricular germinal zone and neocortex of fetuses and newborns at 22-40 weeks' gestation with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus should be considered as morphological differential diagnostic criteria for the disease.
