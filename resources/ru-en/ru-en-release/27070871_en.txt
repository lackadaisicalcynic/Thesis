[Methods of internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts].
AIM
To present own experience of internal drainage and characteristics of its different variants which are applied in various countries.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Endosonography-assisted internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts was performed in 25 patients.
Plastic stents were implanted in one stage without change of instruments while metal stents - with change of instruments during manipulation.  RESULTS
Intervention was successful in 24 patients.  In 1 case bleeding developed during cystostomy that required open surgery.
Plastic and metal stents were used in 11 and 12 patients respectively.
1 patient had two pancreatic pseudocysts.  Therefore 2 stents of both types were used in this case.
Clinical success was achieved in 91% of cases.
CONCLUSION
Different variants of method resolve problem of surgical approach, stomy and choice of stent.
However every technique is targeted to resolve separate problem while single method is not accepted.
Further large comparative studies are necessary to define optimal technique of internal drainage.
