[Foreign bodies (disk batteries) in the nose].  This paper reports the results of analysis of the treatment of 8 children after the removal a disk battery from the nasal cavity.
It was shown that the restoration of all the structures of the nasal cavity is possible if the foreign body remains in it during a short (up to 5 hours) time.  The longer presence of such a body in the nasal cavity gives rise to post-traumatic defects, in the first place septal perforations and injuries to the inferior turbinated bone.
In such cases, the foreign body must be immediately removed from the nasal cavity, and the child should be placed under thorough medical observation taking into consideration the long process of rejection of necrotic tissues and healing of the resulting defects.
