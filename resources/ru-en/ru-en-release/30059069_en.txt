[Gemistocytic astrocytomas].  Gemistocytic astrocytomas (GA) are a variant of diffuse astrocytomas GII (WHO, 2016).
Like all diffuse astrocytomas, GA recur with time, which is often accompanied by malignant degeneretion into the anaplastic astrocytoma GIII or to the secondary glioblastoma GIV.
However, the progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with GA is less than in patients with diffuse astrocytomas.
Given that this group of patients, according to the WHO classification (2016), is classified as GII, patients with GA usually do not receive comprehensive treatment.
We have conducted a thorough analysis of research on this problem for the period from 1956 to 2017.
Differences in the histological pattern, immunohistochemical and molecular-genetic profiles, survival of patients with GA and diffuse astrocytomas GII are shown there.
A clinical case of a patient with transformation of a diffuse astrocytoma in GA (GIII) and then into a secondary glioblastoma is presented.
