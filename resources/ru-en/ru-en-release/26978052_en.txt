[Experience of the antidepressive therapy with valdoxan (agomelatine) in a psychogeriatric unit of the psychiatric hospital].
OBJECTIVE
To assess therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and safety of valdoxan (agomelatine) in the treatment of depression in elderly inpatients of the psychiatric hospital.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 20 patients, aged 60 years and older, with depression of varying severity.  Patients received valdoxan in standard doses 25-50 mg/day during 42 days.
RESULTS
Valdoxan showed a good balanced profile (in terms of indicators of depression, anxiety and anhedonia) of therapeutic response and tolerability in inpatients with mild to moderate depression.  The use of valdoxan led to a significant reduction of depressive disorders and anxiety already in the early period of treatment.
The severity of anhedonia decreased to the 14th day of treatment.  A significant improvement in cognitive functioning of patients was noted to the end of treatment.
CONCLUSION
Valdoxan can be recommended for treatment of mild and moderate depression in inpatients of psychiatric hospitals.
