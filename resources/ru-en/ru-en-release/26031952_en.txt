[Laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment of early adhesive small bowel obstruction after gynecological surgery].  It is presented the results of diagnostic and curative laparoscopic interventions in 33 patients with acute early adhesive small bowel obstruction.
Ileus developed after surgical treatment (laparotomy) of different gynecological diseases.
Laparoscopy appeared as the most informative diagnostic method to confirm diagnosis in all patients, to estimate state of abdominal cavity and small pelvis organs what can help to determine method of surgical treatment.

Early adhesive ileus was resolved laparoscopically in 21 (63.6%) of 33 patients.  Recurrent acute early adhesive ileus was detected in 1 (4.7%) patient.
