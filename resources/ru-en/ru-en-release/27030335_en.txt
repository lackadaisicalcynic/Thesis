[Population characteristics of metabolic syndrome components in 25-64-year-old males of an average urbanized Siberian town].
AIM  To establish the population characteristics of the components of metabolic syndrome (MS) in the age range of 25-64-year-old males in an average urbanized Siberian town.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was conducted in a representative sample of the electorate of a Tyumen administrative district among 1000 males, with 250 being in each of 4 life decades (25-34, 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64 years).
There were 850 (85%) responses.
The IDF criteria (2005) were used to evaluate MS.
RESULTS
In the Tyumen open population of 25-64-year-old men, the population characteristics of systolic blood pressure (BP) and waist circumference (WC) were shifted to the right in the normal distribution range, which determined the high prevalence of hypertension and abdominal obesity (AO).
In the 25-64-year-old men with the high prevalence of hypertension (a standardized rate of 59.8%) and AO (a standardized rate of 42.6%), the age was positively related to systolic BP in the third to fifth decades of life, diastolic BP, and WC at all ages.
CONCLUSION
Examining the epidemiological situation regarding the prevalence of MS components necessitates the elaboration of a scientifically sound prevention program in the specific conditions of an average urbanized Siberian town.
