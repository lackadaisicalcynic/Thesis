[Videolaparoscopic and morphological parallels in diagnosis of different forms of acute appendicitis].  AIM  To compare results of macroscopic assessment and materials of histological examination of 1635 appendices removed using videolaparoscopy in patients with acute appendicitis.
All patients have been treated in N.V.Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Care for the period from 2002 to 2014.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Intraoperative macroscopic assessment of appendix's inflammatory changes was performed using some conventional signs.
Ð¡atarrhal, phlegmonous and gangrenous changes were suspected in 77 (4.7%), 1432 (87.5%) and 126 (7.7%) cases respectively.
RESULTS
Histological examination revealed catarrhal, phlegmonous and gangrenous changes in 86 (5.3%), 1338 (81.8%) and 115 (7.0%) cases respectively.
In 65 (4.0%) patients changes were estimated as chronic, 31 (1.9%) patients had not inflammation.
Intraoperatively suspected diagnosis of different forms of appendicitis was confirmed by histological survey in 94.1%.
Most cases of matched intraoperative and histological diagnosis were observed in case of phlegmonous appendicitis (88.2%).
Only 5.9% of patients had not acute inflammation of appendix that may be explained by overdiagnosis and excess of indications for appendectomy.
