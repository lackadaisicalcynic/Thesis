[The DC-potential of the brain in older women with postural instability].
The article presents the results of studies of the DC-potential of the brain level distribution in elderly women with postural instability.  Analysis of the DC-potential of the brain level distribution was held by mapping obtained by measuring the monopolar values of the DC-potential of the brain and calculating deviations in each of the leads from the average records which were registered in all areas of the head.
It is established that elderly women with postural instability DC-potential of the brain level distribution are characterized by increasing in background values and rigid structure of the interaction between brain regions.
The disturbance of the principle of the dome-shaped DC-potential of the brain level distribution due to the alignment of values for brain regions was revealed.  Factor model with postural instability reflects the control strengthening over the potential falls from the frontal areas of the brain.
