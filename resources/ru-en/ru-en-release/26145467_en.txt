[Osteostimulating effect of bone xenograft on bone tissue regeneration].
The aim of experimental case-control study performed in 28 dogs divided in 2 groups was to assess local tissue reactions on bone xenograft transplantation; dynamics of bone remodeling and formation at the site of bone defect wall contacting with bone xenograft; dynamics and mechanisms of xenograft remodeling.
Transplantation of xenograft in conventional bone defects did not cause inflammatory of destructive reactions because of high biocompatibility of the material.
At transplantation site active fibrous bone trabeculae formation filling the spaces between xenograft participles was observed.  On the 90th day newly formed bone showed lammelar structure.
Simultaneously from the 42d day the invasion of cell elements from recipient bed into the material was seen leading to xenograft resorption.  The observed dynamics may be assessed as gradual substitution of xenograft with newly formed host bone structures.
