[The Metabolic Optimized Fast Track Concept: preoperative preparation for abdominal surgery].  In recent years the protocols of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (E.R.A.S.) have been introduced into clinical practice and actively used.
The goal of E.R.A.S. is to increase recovery, decrease complications and reduce length of stay after surgery through optimization of perioperative management.  One of the key elements of E.R.A.S. is Metabolic Optimized Fast Track Concept (MOFA).
It involves the administration of combined carbohydrate-protein-glutamine drinks which results into decreased insulin resistance in the early postoperative period.  The implementation of MOFA within the structure of perioperative nutrition and metabolic support in abdominal surgery may actually be beneficial by reducing postoperative complications, length of hospital stay and mortality rate.
