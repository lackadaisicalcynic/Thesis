[The role of topical glucocorticoids in the treatment of rhinosinusitis].  The guidelines of the European position paper on rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps (EPOS, 2012) ascribe the highest strength and the most comprehensive evidence-based significance to the application of intranasal glucocorticosteroids (inGCS) as the first-line therapy for the patients presenting with acute and polypous rhinosinusitis; moreover they are recommended as the medications of choice for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis in the absence of polyps.
The author presents the data concerning the mechanism of action, clinical effectiveness, and safety of inGCS used for the treatment of acute, recurrent, and chronic rhinosinusitis.
It is shown that mometason furoate produces the favourable therapeutic effect and is possessed of beneficial pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties in the cases of its topical application.
The comparative randomized clinical study (RCS) of the new preparation of mometason furoate in the form of the intranasal spray (manufactured by 'Teva' Ltd.) registered in the Russian Federation in 2015 has demonstrated that it can be considered as a therapeutic equivalent to nasonex.
