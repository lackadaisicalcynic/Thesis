[Gold weight implants for lagophthalmos correction in chronic facial nerve paralysis (late results)].  UNLABELLED
Upper eyelid weigh gold implant is the widely accepted standard for the treatment of paralytic lagophthalmos (PL).  AIM
To evaluate late outcomes of PL correction with chain gold implants.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Chain gold implants were inserted in the upper eyelids of 70 patients with lagophthalmos due to chronic facial paralysis.
A comprehensive ophthalmic examination was performed prior to surgery and then at months 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36.
RESULTS
The results obtained prove the method highly effective.  None of the patients developed any severe complications.
Cases of implant removal were few.  Some of the studied biometric parameters decreased significantly after surgery, while the upper eyelid excursion increased.
The implant had no effect on the inner surface of the cornea and its peripheral thickness.
CONCLUSION
Efficacy of the proposed eyelid implant has been convincingly demonstrated; late complications have been analyzed.
