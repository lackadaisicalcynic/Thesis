AIM  To improve the results of treatment of a widespread purulent peritonitis in children by optimizing fluid therapy includes the use of combined treatment: reamberin and remaxol.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We studied 269 patients aged 1 to 15 years with a widespread purulent peritonitis treated at the children's surgical departments in Samara from 2001 to 2015.
The study group included 179 children who used the optimized infusion therapy.
In the study group was allocated to 2 groups: 69 children in infusion therapy which used reamberin and 110 patients in which treatment was applied reamberin and remaxol.
The surgical treatment used laparoscopic sanation of the abdomen.
Comprehensive survey included a study of dynamics of the white blood cell count, leukocyte index Kalf-Caliph, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, temperature, total albumin concentration, transaminase levels.
Catamnesis studied 48 patients with the definition of complex intima-media thickness in the projection of basilar, brachial and femoral arteries.
RESULTS
A study compared indicators of both groups, revealed a more rapid reduction of intoxication symptomps (leukocytosis, LII, body temperature), the disappearance of enteric disease, recovery of protein-synthetic function of the liver, decrease of cytolytic and mesenchymal-inflammatory syndromes in the main group, especially in the subgroup in which treatment was included remaxol.  CONCLUSION
The use of reamberin and remaxol in infusion therapy led to improvement of the results of the treatment of common purulent peritonitis in children.  Study catamnesis with the study of the intima-media revealed that children undergoing widespread purulent peritonitis further develop signs of endothelial dysfunction.
The developed clinical recommendations to significantly reduce the risk of developing signs of endothelial dysfunction, thereby reducing the possible appearance of vascular pathology in patients who underwent childhood widespread purulent peritonitis.
