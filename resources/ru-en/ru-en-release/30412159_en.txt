Spinal surgery in patients with overweight and obesity is associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications.  Minimally invasive (MIS-TLIF) and traditional (O-TLIF) techniques of rigid stabilization are extensively used, but the advantages and disadvantages of MIS-TLIF in patients with an elevated body mass index (BMI) remain controversial.
The study aim was to assess the efficacy of a new low-invasive rigid fixation technique and traditional open spinal fusion in surgical treatment of degenerative lumbar spine diseases in patients with overweight and obesity.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Two study groups were allocated: group I (MIS-TLIF, n=32) included patients operated on using an original technique of spinal canal reconstruction, interbody spinal fusion, and combined transpedicular stabilization; group II (O-TLIF, n=41) included patients who underwent single-level rigid stabilization through the median approach.  The mean follow-up period was 34 months in group I and 40 months in group II. Comparative analysis assessed clinical parameters, intraoperative indicators, postoperative period specificity, instrumental data, and complications.
Compared to the O-TLIF group, the MIS-TLIF group was characterized by a shorter time of surgery, X-ray exposure, activation, and hospital stay as well as by a smaller amount of blood loss.  A comparative analysis of the pain severity (visual analogue scale) and performance status (ODI) in the follow-up period revealed significantly better results in group I, which was associated with smaller intraoperative injury to soft tissues.
In this case, the interbody bone block formed in the long-term postoperative period in 88% of group I patients and in 83% of group II patients (p=0.15).  According to the instrumental data, there was statistically significant greater muscular atrophy in the group after O-TLIF (p<0.001).
