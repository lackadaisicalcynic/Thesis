[The possibility of using standardized self-report anxiety and depression scales in elderly patients: Depression scales/questionnaires in elderly].
AIM  To study possibilities of using depression scales in elderly patients, evaluate the parameters of their reliability and validity and develop practical recommendations on the use of these scales in clinical practice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 234 patients, aged over 50 years, with anxious depression.
The following scales/questionnaires BDI, GDS-15, CES-D-10, CES-D-20, ZDS and HADS-D were used at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment.
Data analysis included the calculation of convergent, discriminative and diagnostic validity of depression scales/questionnaires in elderly.
RESULTS
All scales are effective for the diagnosis of depression in elderly people.
The possibility of using these scales in patients with mild cognitive impairment is shown.
An increase of the correlation between the scores on depression and anxiety scales up to the loss of discriminative validity of «double» scales/questionnaires by the alternative set of symptoms for the diagnosis of depression and anxiety was confirmed.
