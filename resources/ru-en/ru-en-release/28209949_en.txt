[Surgical treatment of retroperitoneal masses].
AIM
To improve the results of treatment of patients with retroperitoneal tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 83 patients with retroperitoneal tumors including 57 cases of benign tumors and 26 patients with malignancies.
Laparotomy (Lt), robot-assisted (RA) and laparoscopic (Ls) techniques were used in 35, 34 and 14 patients respectively.
Median tumor sizes in the largest dimension were 102 mm, 75 mm and 81.5 mm in Lt, RA and Ls groups respectively.
RESULTS
Average time of surgery was 112.5 minutes in Lt-group, 140 min in RA group and 125 minutes in Ls group.
Median blood loss was 125 ml, 50 ml and 50 ml in the same groups respectively.
Conversion was performed in 1 patient during RA-surgery and in 7 patients during laparoscopy.
Postoperative complications occurred in 6 patients after laparotomy and in 5 patients after RA-intervention.
There were no deaths.
CONCLUSION
Comprehensive evaluation of different surgical methods is necessary to achieve successful treatment of retroperitoneal tumors.
Conventional approach is indicated for tumors over 10 cm while minimally invasive techniques are justified for tumors less than 10 cm.
RA-interventions facilitates surgery for tumors located in difficult areas and small anatomical spaces as well as for neoplasms adjacent to great vessels.
