[Combined forecasting system of peritonitis outcome].
AIM
To create a reliable system for assessing of severity and prediction of the outcome of peritonitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Critical analysis of the systems for peritonitis severity assessment is presented.
The study included outcomes of 347 patients who admitted at the Department of Faculty Surgery of Peoples' Friendship University of Russia in 2015-2016.  The cause of peritonitis were destructive forms of acute appendicitis, cholecystitis, perforated gastroduodenal ulcer, various perforation of small and large intestines (including tumor).
RESULTS
Combined forecasting system for peritonitis severity assessment is created.  The system includes clinical, laboratory data, assessment of systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) and severity of organ failure (qSOFA).
The authors focused on easily identifiable parameters which are available in virtually any surgical hospital.
Threshold value (lethal outcome probability over 50%) is 8 scores in this system.
Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 93.3, 99.7 and 98.9%, respectively according to ROC-curve that exceeds those parameters of MPI and APACHE II.
