[Surgical treatment of a female patient with type III nonspecific aortoarteritis].  Described herein is a case report of a severe lesion of the arterial system in non-specific aortoarteritis: lesion of the aortic arch branches, thoracoabdominal segment of the aorta, abdominal aorta, visceral and renal arteries, thus underlining a multiple nature of the lesion of the aorta and its branches in the pathology concerned.
Diagnosis of lesions of the aorta and its branches was made by means of multispiral computed tomography (MSCT), being the most informative method of examination in this cohort of patients, making it possible to accurately diagnose both the degree of the lesion and its extension, to choose an optimal surgical policy, to carry out dynamic follow up of the condition of the reconstructed arterial segments.
