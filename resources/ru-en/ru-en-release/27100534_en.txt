[Role of the endothelium in pathogenesis of chronic postembolic pulmonary hypertension].  The review contains the data concerning the role of the endothelium in the development of chronic postembolic pulmonary hypertension.
It is noted that this pathology is associated with changes in the balance of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators, as well as haemostasis factors synthesized by the endothelium, thus leading to remodelling of not only pulmonary arterioles but venous pulmonary vessels.
Along with it, the mechanisms of the endothelial function and biochemical markers of this process in patients with chronic postembolic pulmonary hypertension remain insufficiently studied.
Such markers may be an increase in blood plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, endothelin I and vascular endothelial growth factor along with a decrease in the level of thrombomodulin.
