REALIZATION OF INFORMED CONSENT AS ONE OF PATIENT'S RIGHTS: CURRENT SITUATION IN AZERBAIJAN.
Azerbaijan is a country in which the law is based on democratic principles.
The mentioned principles underlie the national health care law.  Democratic values, such as respect for human rights and freedoms, human dignity, as well as universal bioethical principles that are widely implemented in the national law, create conditions for the implementation of the patient's rights.
The basic law governing the doctor-patient relationship, Law on Protection of Health of Population in Azerbaijan, reflects the basic patients' rights and obligations of doctors and medical institutions.
Informed consent, which is a key component of patient rights, is also reflected, however, to date, a significant drawback of the Azerbaijan medical legislation is described in the article in this field.  For example, at the moment there is no single standardized informed consent form in the country's different medical institutions.
Due to the absence of any legally approved standards for informed consent forms, public and private health care institutions individually develop such forms, which sometimes can differ significantly.
At the moment, one of the important directions in the field of healthcare is its improvement in accordance with international standards.
The research made it possible to make conclusions about the necessary measures to improve and unify the informed consent form.  The authors also analyzed the main provisions of the medical law of Azerbaijan and identified the main trends of its further development.
