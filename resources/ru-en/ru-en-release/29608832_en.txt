[Vitamin D deficiency as a risk factor for chronic non-infectious diseases.]
Vitamin D deficiency is an important risk factor for a number of chronic non-infectious diseases.  The results of the study showed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with cardiovascular and bronchial obstruction diseases.
Patients with coronary artery disease in association with hypertension were diagnosed with a vitamin D deficiency in 60% of cases, a pronounced deficiency in 40%; in patients with arterial hypertension - a vitamin D deficiency in 80%, and a pronounced deficit - in 20%; in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - vitamin D deficiency in 33%, and a pronounced deficit - in 67%; in patients with bronchial asthma - vitamin D deficiency in 75%, a severe deficit in 25%, and a vitamin D deficiency in 25% of the subjects.
According to the received results, vitamin D deficiency is associated with intensity of chronic heart failure, arterial hypertension in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and also with the degree of respiratory failure accompanying glucocorticoid therapy in patients with bronchial obstructive pathology.
The intensity of hypovitaminosis of vitamin D is aggravated with age and the duration of menopause in women.
The article shows that patients with chronic non-infectious diseases have a high risk of osteoporotic fractures, most patients with bronchial obstructive and cardiovascular diseases need anti-osteoporotic therapy and osteodensitometry.
