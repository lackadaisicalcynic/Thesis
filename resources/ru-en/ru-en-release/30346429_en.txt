[60 years towards definition of dyscirculatory (vascular) encephalopathy: can we put new wine into old wineskins?]
The term 'dyscirculatory encephalopathy' (DEP) was proposed in 1958 by Garun Maksudov and Vladimir Kogan for the definition of gradually progressive diffuse brain changes with slowly worsening of cerebral circulation ('dyscirculation') in vascular disorders.  The article presents current data on the etiology and pathogenesis of DEP, with the emphasis on its syndromal status, clinical/pathogenetic types of DEP, neuropsychological and neuroimaging signs, which provide a causal relationship to avoid hyperdiagnosis of DEP.
In addition, possible methods of treatment and prevention of DEP are considered.
