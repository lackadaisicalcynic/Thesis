[The distribution of carbosulfan in the body of warm-blooded animals].  The objective of the present work was to study the specific distribution patterns of carbosulfan in the body of warm-blooded animals by means of thin-layer chromatography, low-pressure column chromatography, electron spectrophotometry, and GCh/ MS.
The carbosulfan distribution in the warm-blooded animals (rats) was investigated after the intragastric administration of this poisonous substance at a dose equivalent to three median lethal doses (LD50) in the form of an aqueous emulsion.
The highest concentrations of carbosulfan were found in the contents of the stomach, small and large intestines, liver, and lungs.
The same organs and spleen contained carbofuran, the main metabolite of carbosulfan.
