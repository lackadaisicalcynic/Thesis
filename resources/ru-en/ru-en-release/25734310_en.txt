[The experimental substantiation of the application of bone cement for the reconstruction of postoperative defects in the walls of paranasal sinuses].
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the biocompatibility of bone cement used in plastic surgery of the anterior wall of the paranasal sinusis.
This material was used to shape a fragment corresponding to the bone defect to be placed subperiosteally.  This experimental study has demonstrated that the anterior wall of the paranasal sinusis can be reconstructed within 1.5--3 months after surgery owing to the formation of a granulation tissue replaced in the course of time by the connective tissue, coarse-fibred tissue and, locally, bone plate tissue (in that order).
