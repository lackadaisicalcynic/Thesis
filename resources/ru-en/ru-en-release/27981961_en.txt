[The possibilities for the expert assessment of the influence of the structural features of a hunting weapon barrel on the characteristics of injuries inflicted by the multi-element ammunition in a cylindrical container].  The objective of the present study was to analyze the available information contained in the special literature concerning the possibilities for the expert assessment of the influence of the constructive and ballistic characteristics of hunting weapon barrels («cylinder» versus «choke») and their regular ammunition (equipped with pellets placed in a special wad-container and without it) on the mechanisms of damage formation.
It was shown that the barrel muzzle narrowing produces the well apparent effect on the process of formation and release of all the damaging factors of the shot which makes it difficult to diagnose the resultant damage.
It is concluded that the use of shooting ammunition with the pellets enclosed in wad-containers creates the objective prerequisite for the differentiation between its different types.
