[Hyponatremia: A clinical approach].  Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte metabolic abnormality in clinical practice.
The unfavorable course of many diseases is associated with hyponatremia.
Acute severe hyponatremia is life-threatening because cerebral edema may develop.  Less obvious chronic hyponatremia increases the risk of balance problems, falls and fractures, especially in elderly patients.
In any occasion, hyponatremia should not be now regarded only as a laboratory phenomenon in critically ill patients, but it necessitates a thorough clinical analysis of each individual case and appropriate therapy.
The paper presents approaches to diagnosing and treating hyponatremia in various clinical situations.
