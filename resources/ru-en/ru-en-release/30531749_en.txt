[Early outcomes of robot-assisted liver resection].  AIM
To assess an experience of robot-assisted liver resection using CUSUM-test.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of 46 robot-assisted liver resections were retrospectively analyzed by using of CUSUM-test.
RESULTS
There were 3 periods in development of the technology.  The 1st period - procedures with the lowest index of difficulty (n=16), the 2nd period - expansion of the indications for difficult resections (n=18) and the 3rd period - stabilization of the results (n=12).
The dynamics of difficulty index, intraoperative blood loss, duration of procedure and morbidity (Clavien-Dindo Grade II-V) were evaluated.
Five liver resections were needed to decrease blood loss and duration of the procedure.
Expansion of indications was feasible after 16 procedures.  Stable results were obtained after 34 liver resections.
