[REM-sleep behavior disorder and sleepwalking in a patient with Parkinson's disease and essential tremor].  REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), a form of parasomnia, is characterized by motor and/or speech activity during sleep corresponding to the dream content.
RBD is currently considered as a marker of onset of neurodegenerative diseases (sinucleinopathies) and as a most specific early symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD).
The authors describe a clinical case of a patient with the combination of essential tremor, initial signs of PD and RBD.
A polysomnographic study has confirmed clinical signs of RBD and determined the disturbances of sleep architecture: the increase in falling asleep, number of awakenings, wakefulness during sleep, the absence of deep slow-wave sleep.
The particular features of the patient were essential tremor and sleep walking.
