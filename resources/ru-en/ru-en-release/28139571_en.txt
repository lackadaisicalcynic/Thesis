[The preliminary results of subthalamic nucleus stimulation after destructive surgery in Parkinson's disease].  OBJECTIVE  To evaluate the efficacy of bilateral electrical stimulation (ES) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) after preceding pallidotomy or ventrolateral (VL) thalamotomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 9 patients with bilateral STN ES who had undergone previous unilateral destructive surgery on the subcortical structures: pallidotomy (5 patients) and VL thalamotomy (4).
A control group consisted of 9 patients with STN ES, without prior destructive surgery.
A clinical and neurological examination included quantitative assessment of motor disturbances using the Hoehn-Yahr scale and Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS).
UPDRS was used to evaluate the motor activity (IIIrd part of the scale) and severity of drug-induced dyskinesia and motor fluctuations (IVth part of the scale).
RESULTS
In the group of STN ES with preceding destruction of the subcortical structures, an improvement in motor functions in the early period (6 months) was 45%, and severity of drug-induced complications was decreased by 75%.
In a group of STN DBS without destruction, motor disturbances were improved by 61%, and drug-induced complications were decreased by 77%.
Improvement in motor functions amounted to 51.9% in patients with preceding pallidotomy (GPi destruction) and 37.5% in a group with preceding VL thalamotomy.
The equivalent dose of levodopa was reduced by 51.39%, from 1,008±346 to 490±194, in the study group and by 55.04%, from 963±96 to 433±160, in the control group.
CONCLUSION
Bilateral STN neurostimulation is effective after unilateral stereotaxic destruction of the subcortical structures in PD patients.
