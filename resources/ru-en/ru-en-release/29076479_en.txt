AIM  To analyze the first experience of laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery for locally advanced and generalized stomach cancer at the Burdenko Clinic of Faculty Surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Since 2011 27 laparoscopic and 2 robot-assisted operations for locally advanced and generalized stomach cancer have been performed in our hospital.
Mean age of patients was 62.1Â±10 years.  There were 19 men and 10 women.
RESULTS
There were 11 gastrectomies with abdominal esophageal resection and 18 Billroth I subtotal resections.  Advanced surgery was made in 4 (13.7%) patients including 1 case of transverse colon resection and 3 cases of liver resection.
Mean time of surgery was 260 min (180-380 min) in gastrectomy, 210 min (175-310 min) in subtotal resection.
Mean intraoperative blood loss was 120 ml (50-220 ml).
CONCLUSION
Minimally invasive technologies reliably reduce blood loss, rehabilitation, ICU- and hospital-stay.
The quality of life after minimally invasive interventions is significantly higher compared with conventional surgery while reduced rehabilitation allows to start chemotherapy already in early postoperative period.
