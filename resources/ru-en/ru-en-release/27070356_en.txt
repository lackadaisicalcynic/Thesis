[Current concepts on intrathecal humoral immune response and diagnostic importance of oligoclonal immunoglobulins in multiple sclerosis].
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system of probable autoimmune origin.
In this review of literature, the authors present a constantly broadening list of potential antigens, including myelin and non-myelin structures, that cause the autoimmune reaction.  Determination of antibodies to any antigen has not sufficient specificity and sensitivity for the use in routine laboratory practice.
Oligoclonal immunoglobulins determined with isoelectric focusing (IEF) technique are currently considered as the main immunological MS markers.
The sensitivity and specificity of IEF are 90 and 86%, respectively.  The authors have considered the additional markers such as oligoclonal IgM and MRZ-response.
