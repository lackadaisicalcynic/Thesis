[FIP1L1-PDGFRА-positive myeloproliferative disease with eosinophilia: A rare case with multiple organ dysfunction and a response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy].  The described case of FIP1L1-PDGFRА-positive myeloproliferative disease is characterized by an atypical aggressive course to develop severe specific complications as injuries to the brain, heart, lung, and intestine.
Pathogenetic therapy with imatinib could stabilize a patient's state, but failed to produce a complete hematological response.
Switching from imatinib to dasatinib could produce sustained clinical, hematological, and molecular remissions.
