[Enteral distress syndrome in surgery: definition, pathogenesis, diagnosis].  It was performed a comprehensive experimental and clinical study of functional and metabolic status of the intestine in acute peritonitis, pancreatic necrosis, acute intestinal obstruction.
We obtained objective data of impaired barrier function based on levels of toxins in arterial and mesenteric venous blood.  Association of organ and organismic homeostatic changes was revealed.
It was proved an important role of membrane-destabilizing processes in intestinal epithelium as a cause of enteral insufficiency.  Leading trigger mechanisms of lipid metabolic disorders were determined.
Enteral distress syndrome was determined as pathological response to acute abdominal surgical diseases.
Enteral distress syndrome is a complex of pathological processes due to membrane-destabilizing mechanisms, impaired intestinal barrier function followed by progression of endogenous intoxication.
This syndrome significantly aggravates the course of acute surgical abdominal diseases.
