[The modern possibilities for the application of photogrammetry in the forensic medical practice and scientific researches].
The authors consider the modern possibilities for the application of photogrammetry in the domestic forensic medical practice and scientific researches as exemplified by the use of 3D-laser scanning and the single-chamber photogrammetric technique for the visualization of various objects including the places of road traffic accidents and other events.  Special emphasis is laid on the objective difficulties likely to be encountered in this work and the prospects for the further application of photogrammetric methods in the work of experts in various fields of human activities.
The important role of scientific and technical progress in the solution of practical expert problems is illustrated based on the utilization of the unique up-to-date computed technologies capable of improving the quality of expert support of investigative activities.
