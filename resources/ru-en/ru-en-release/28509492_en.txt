[Suitable working conditions for elderly people with different degrees of compensation of dysfunctional blood circulation of eyes].
In dealing with complex problems in labor and social rehabilitation of elderly people with different degrees of compensation of dysfunctional blood circulation of eyes, a great role play methods of rational and qualitative analysis of appropriate employment.  The analysis of 110 patients of 55-70 years of age (220 eyes) with dysfunctional blood circulation of eyes has been done.
