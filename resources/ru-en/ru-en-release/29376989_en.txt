[Syndrome of mild encephalopathy with a reversible splenial corpus callosum lesion].  Mild encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS) is a clinico-radiological syndrome that has been associated with a variety of underlying etiologies including viral and bacterial infections, epilepsy and antiepileptic drug cessation, hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance.
We report a case of a 24-year-old woman who had an isolated splenial lesion in the corpus callosum on neuroimaging associated with MERS.
