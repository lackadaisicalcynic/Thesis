[The peculiar morphological features of the blood stains on the snow over of different density].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the peculiar morphological features of the blood stains on the snow over of different density.
We have undertaken the modeling and investigation of the blood stains on the loose snow cover (ρ=0.35±0.03 g/cm3) and at the areas of snow compacted by a motor-vehicle wheel (ρ=0.96±0.03 g/cm3) with the use of the visual, metric, descriptive, and statistical methods.  The analysis of the blood stain patterns on the loose snow showed that a blood drop tends to form a depressed cylindrical canal at the bottom of which an irregularly shaped spherical element can be seen; it is composed of small snow crystals soaked with blood.
The upper end of the canal has the fine-scalloped edge tending to shed unevenly.  The morphological picture of the blood stains at the compacted snow cover is similar to that on the hard wettable rough surfaces; they have the oval shape and the unevenly serrated edge with the well apparent signs of sputtering.at the periphery.
