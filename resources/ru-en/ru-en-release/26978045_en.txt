[Development of preclinical diagnosis and preventive treatment of neurodegenerative diseases].  Neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) are serious fatal neurological and mental diseases that resulted in disability and fethal outcome.
Based on the advances of basic sciences over the last two decades, new knowledge on the risk factors for NDD and molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis are obtained.
It has been shown that the accelerated process of neuronal death which is the main cause of NDD development begins long before the appearance of clinical symptoms.  The first symptoms appeared only after the death of most specific regulatory neurons and exhaustion of brain compensatory reserve.
Only at that time, one can make the diagnosis and start traditional treatment of patients that accounts for the extremely low efficacy of the latter.  Currently, complex preclinical diagnosis based on the identification of relatively specific clinical precursors and peripheral biomarkers has been developing.
Development of preclinical diagnosis and preventive treatment is a strategic issue of modern neurology and psychiatry.
The resolution of this issue allows to consider NDD as cured, but not fatal, diseases.
