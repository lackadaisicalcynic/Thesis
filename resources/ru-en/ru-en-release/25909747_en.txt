[The outcomes of arthroplasty in degenerative lesions in the lumbar spine].  STUDY DESIGN
A retrospective study.  OBJECTIVE
To investigate the safety and effectiveness of total intervertebral disc replacement with a Maverick prosthesis in patients with discogenic pain in the lower lumbar spine.  SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA
Lumbar disc arthroplasty has been developed as an alternative to rigid interbody fusion for patients with pathology in the lower lumbar discs.  According to the developers, motion preservation in the operated segment should prevent secondary pathology of the adjacent segments.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  From November 2007 to date, 41 patients have been operated on and 42 disc prostheses have been placed.
All patients underwent surgery in the same hospital by the same surgeon.  The clinical and radiological results of treatment of 35 patients were studied.
The patients were examined before surgery, immediately after surgery and then in the intervals of 3-6, 6-12, 12-24, and 36-48 months.
The longest follow-up was 61 months.
Mean follow-up was 30 months.
RESULTS
Patients operated on using total intervertebral disc prosthesis demonstrated a significant improvement compared to their preoperative status.  A significant reduction of back and leg pain intensity was observed.
The quality of life significantly improved.
The intervertebral disc space height, the sagittal balance and the balance in the adjacent levels were restored and preserved after correction.  The motion in the implanted segment was preserved.
Total lumbar disc replacement with a Maverick prosthesis has proved to be an effective and safe technique.  The clinical and radiological methods showed the significant improvement of the patients' status.
