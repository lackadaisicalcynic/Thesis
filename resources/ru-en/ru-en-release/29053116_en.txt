[Abdominal pain in migraine patients].
AIM  To study the frequency of comorbid abdominal pain in migraine patients and the influence of that symptom on the formation of disease phenotype.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Clinical features of migraine were studied in 66 patients with episodic migraine and 40 patients with chronic migraine.  Presence of pain, intensity, duration of seizure-associated abdominal pain and interictal abdominal pain were assessed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The frequency of abdominal pain in the painful phase of migraine was >11% and did not depend on the type of migraine.  Pain in the abdomen were reported by 88% of patients, with the increase in the frequency in patients with chronic migraine.
The intensity and frequency of abdominal pain did not depend on organic pathology of the digestive system.  Correlations between the intensity and duration of abdominal pain during the migraine attack phase (k=0.59), between the intensity of associated pain and maladjustment severity (k=0.59), and also between the abdominal pain intensity during the painful phase and in the interictal period were identified.
Allodynia developed more frequently in patients with abdominal pain between migraine attacks (Ð F=0.005).
Also relationships between the level of intensity of interictal abdominal pain and the rates of alexithymia (k=0.24), anxiety (k=0.29) and depression (k=0.25) were revealed.
The association of abdominal pain with disease severity and allodynia suggests similar development of these symptoms.
