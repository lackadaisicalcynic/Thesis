[Analysis of the short-term and long-term results in surgical treatment of the chronic cystic pancreatitis].  INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the practice of abdominal surgery marked increase in the number of patients with pancreatic cysts.
Tactics of treatment of this disease is still disputable.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The article analyzes the treatment of 128 patients with formed pancreatic cysts.  They were divided into three groups: 1) external drainage - 44 (34.4%); 2) internal drainage - 41 (32.0%); 3) resection surgery - 43 (33.6%).
RESULTS
The duodenum resections were introduced for the treatment of the pancreatic head cysts - 21 (48.8%).
Resection methods in the number of postoperative complications (23.3%) could be compared with the operations of the internal drainage of pancreatic cysts (19.5%), although the resection methods are technically more difficult and traumatic.
66 (51.6%) patients were observed in the long-term period.
The number of postoperated disease recurrences was more in group 1 (28.6%).
Quality of life indicators (SF-36) were higher in group 3.
We marked the best results after resection operations.
CONCLUSION
So this type of operation can be recommended for the treatment of patients with formed pancreatic cysts as the most radical method.
