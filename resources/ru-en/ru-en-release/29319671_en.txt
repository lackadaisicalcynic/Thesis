[A modified implant for upper eyelid ptosis correction in frontalis suspension surgery].  AIM
to develop a modified implant to correct ptosis through brow suspension and to evaluate its effectiveness.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The clinical group consisted of 20 patients (29 eyes) aged 23 to 69 years (45±5.3 years on the average) and the comparison group - of 20 patients (33 eyes) aged 19 to 77 years (47±9.5 years on the average).
All patients were operated on for severe ptosis of the upper eyelid, which implied stitching their eyelids to the eyebrows.
In the main group, an original implant was introduced as suspensory material - a 200 µm thick porous polytetrafluoroethylene tape, length 13 cm, width 6 mm, round staggered perforation pattern, 1.5 mm holes, 3.5 mm pitch.
In the comparison group, Mersilene mesh strips were used.
The article contains a detailed description of the surgical technique.
Checkups were performed at 1, 6, and 12 months.
Follow-up periods were up to 4 years (1.7 years on the average) in the main group and up to 7 years (5.1 years on the average) - in the controls.
RESULTS
Were evaluated by the width of the palpebral fissure at raised eyebrows, marginal reflex distance (MRD, which is the distance between the center of the pupil and the upper eyelid margin), presence and depth of the upper eyelid crease, and residual lagophthalmos.
Examinations held at months 1, 6, and 12 after surgery showed that the results were positive and stable in all cases.  Neither signs of recurrence, nor statistically significant differences between the groups were found.
CONCLUSION
The use of the original modified implant during frontalis suspension surgery provides high and stable cosmetic result and expands the possibilities of ophthalmic plastic surgery.
