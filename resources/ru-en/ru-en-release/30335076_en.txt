[Relationships of rs7341475 polymorphism and DNA methylation in the reelin gene with schizophrenia symptoms].  AIM
To study the role of polymorphism rs7341475 and methylation of the reelin gene in symptoms of schizophrenia and semantic verbal fluency.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Genotypes at the locus rs7341475 were identified in 556 patients with schizophrenic disorders.
PANSS scores were obtained for 549 patients and 221 patients performed a test for semantic verbal fluency.
The association of the reelin promoter methylation with the PANSS and verbal fluency measures was evaluated in 35 patients.
A five-factor model of the PANSS was used.
RESULTS
The interaction effect of sex with genotype on the PANSS scores was found (F=2.70, p=0.020).
Schizophrenic men homozygous for a common allele G had the lowest scores of the positive syndrome.
Verbal fluency was related to the reelin promoter methylation.
CONCLUSION
The results suggest that polymorphism rs7341475 may be associated with the variability of positive symptomatology in schizophrenic men.
At the same time, the reelin gene methylation pattern, which consists of a higher methylation level in the region of the transcription start site and a lower one in the distal region of the promoter, may be beneficial for verbal fluency.
