[Effectiveness and safety of rufinamide at treatment of epilepsy with complications and drug-resistant epilepsy (according to meta-analysis data)].
AIM
Meta-analysis was undertaken to evaluate rufinamide safety and effectiveness in numerous heterogeneous groups of patients with severe and drug resistant epileptic disorders.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 164 relevant articles available via medico-clinical periodic databases, but only 15 have been chosen suitable for meta-analysis.  All together 1847 participants were included into common massive, with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and similar encephalopathy syndromes, and with drug-resistant partial epileptic forms. 1169 were administered rufinamide additionally to typical anti-epileptic medications (experimental group). 686 received treatment with common practice drugs without rufinamide (control group).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Patient with more than 50% seizures reduction were more numerous in rufinamide group (χ2=89.7 with р=0.000...; ОR=2.9 with 95% CI 2.3-3.7).
Most frequent and statistically reliable complications of rufinamide use were headache/dizziness and nausea/vomiting.
Rufinamide is safe and effective for treatment of different epilepsies including LGS and drug-resistant partial seizures.
Rufinamide may be used as second-line adjuvant for routine neurologic practice.
