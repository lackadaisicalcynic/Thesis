[Is there a place for single laparoscopic approach in colic surgery?].
INTRODUCTION  This prospective randomized study was performed to determine the place of surgery via single laparoscopic access in modern coloproctology.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of right-sided hemicolectomy using multiport laparoscopic-assisted technique (n=48) or single laparoscopic access (n=47) in case of cancer were analyzed.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
There were no significant differences in the incidence of complications, severity of pain, postoperative rehabilitation and quality of life.
Surgery via single access were characterized by better cosmetic effect, less need for analgesics compared with multiport interventions.
However, according to surgeons' opinion operations with single laparoscopic access are more laborious.
CONCLUSION
Thus, single laparoscopic access canot be recommended for routine use in daily practice because of absence of significant advantages in colon resection compared with multiport technique.
