[Stenosis of the carotid artery in women with ischemic stroke and markers of inflammation].
AIM  To assess the relationship between the severity of stenosis of the carotid arteries, the level of female sex hormones and markers of subclinical inflammation in women with ischemic stroke (IS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Two hundred and eleven women (mean age 68.9±9.23 years) were examined.
A history of cardiovascular disease, previous cardiovascular events, type and subtype of stroke were recorded.  Neurological status was assessed using neurological scales.
Atherosclerosis was diagnosed by color duplex scanning of brachiocephalic arteries and laboratory testing (estradiol, markers of subclinical inflammation).
RESULTS
Carotid artery stenosis of ≥50% was found in 13.3% of patients, less severe stenosis in 36.0%.
Stenosis of ≥50% was positively correlated with the level of IL-18, TNF-alpha, and negatively correlated with the level of IL-6, IL-4, and MMSE score.
In dynamics, there was a decrease in the level of TNF-alpha in all groups of patients, and an increase in the IL-4 level in women with carotid artery stenosis of ≥50%.
CONCLUSION
Study of the influence of markers of subclinical inflammation on the atherosclerosis progression and recurrent disorders of cerebral circulation in women with IS should be continued.
