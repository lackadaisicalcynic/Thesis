[Increase of reparative potential of fabrics in sugar diabetes].
AIM
The purpose of the study was to study the effectiveness of the domestic drug Remaxol in reparative processes of laparotomic wound tissues in acute surgical abdominal pathology in patients with diabetes mellitus.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Clinical and laboratory studies were performed in 86 patients with acute surgical pathology of the abdominal cavity, 56 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, including 26 patients who received Remaxol in the early postoperative period (daily intravenous infusions of 400.0 ml for 5 days).  RESULTS
It was established that diabetes mellitus is an important aggravating factor in the reparative process of tissue structures of a laparotomic wound.  Undoubtedly, a significant factor in reducing the reparative potential of tissues is a significant activation of factors leading to membrane-destabilizing phenomena - oxidative stress, activation of phospholipases, hypoxia.
The inclusion of Remaxol, which has antioxidant and antihypoxic effects, allows to significantly correct these pathogenetic components, which is the basis for optimization of the reparative process against the background of diabetes mellitus.  There was a significant decrease in wound complications in the early postoperative period, a significant reduction in the stay of patients in the hospital.
