[Sliding traсheal plasty in children under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (first experience in Russia)].
AIM
To improve the results of surgical treatment of children with extended tracheal stenosis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Since 2013 slidingtraсheal plasty under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed in 4 children aged 1 year 2 months - 4.5 years with extended tracheal stenosis in Children's City Clinical Hospital №13.
Patients' weight was from 10,5 to 16 kg.
Extended tracheal stenosis and complete cartilag inousrings were confirmed in all patients after peoperative survey.
Indications for surgery were based on medical history data, the severity of respiratory failure and survey data.
Sliding traсheal plasty by different approach esunder extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was applied in all patients.
RESULTS
There were no intraoperative complications.
In the study group 1 patient died in remote postoperative period after discharge due to deterioration of his condition caused by upper respiratory tract infection and acute respiratory failure.
In immediate postoperative period 1 patient had pronounced growth of granulation tissue in the area of anastomosis followed laser photocoagulation and prolonged intubation.
The average ICU-stay was 24 days, the duration of mechanical ventilation - 11 days.
Follow-up carefor patients was conducted on terms of 4-6 and 12 months after surgery.
