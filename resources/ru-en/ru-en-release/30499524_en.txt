[XEN-45 Gel Stent implant in glaucoma treatment].  The XEN-45 drainage implant is a hypotensive device made of hydrophilic gelatin and stabilized by glutaraldehyde.
The implant is designed for modern Microinvasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS).
Being installed ab interno, the stent drains aqueous fluid from the anterior chamber into the subconjunctival space.
According to indications, XEN-45 can be used in treatment of primary open angle glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation or pigment glaucoma with uncompensated intraocular pressure amid maximum tolerated hypotensive therapy, and refractory glaucoma including cases with history of unsuccessful surgery.
The implant can also be effectively used in combination with phacoemulsification.
The article describes the structure and implantation process of the XEN drainage and reviews existing clinical trials on its effectiveness.
The article also presents results on hypotensive efficacy of the implant, as well as characteristics and complications of postoperative management.
