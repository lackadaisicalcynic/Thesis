[Surgical treatment of thyroid cancer metastases in the 7th (retrosternal) group of lymph nodes].
The incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) is being significantly increased.  A significant percentage consists of metastatic cancer (MCP) in particular in the anterior-superior mediastinal lymph nodes (Group 7).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
153 out of 324 patients with metastatic TC underwent video-assisted lymphadenectomy of group 7 of lymph nodes.
The operations were combined with interventions on the primary tumor or on cervical lymph nodes in case of recurrence.
RESULTS
The possibility of long-term survival (over 10 years) was studied in more than 80% of cases.
Sternotomy is advisable in case of impossible video-assisted procedure.
