[Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in patients with asthma: Results of a prospective study].
AIM  To estimate the frequency of fungal sensitization and the incidence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in asthmatic patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A total of 140 asthmatic patients were examined.  They underwent allergologic (skin tests for fungal allergens, estimation of total and fungal allergen-specific IgE levels) and mycological (microscopy and inoculation of respiratory biosubstrates) examinations.
Chest computed tomography, when indicated, was done.
A group of patients with ABPA and that of patients with severe asthma and fungal sensitization were identified.
RESULTS
The frequency of fungal sensitization in asthmatic patients was 36%; the main allergenic fungi were Aspergillus and Alternaria.
The incidence of ABPA was as high as 4% in the patients with asthma and 11% in those with severe asthma and fungal sensitization.
CONCLUSION
The given current diagnostic criteria will assist practitioners to identify ABPA, to prevent its progression, and to initiate specific anti-inflammatory and antifungal therapy in due time.
