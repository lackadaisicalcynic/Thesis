[The morphological and molecular genetic characteristics of sarcomatoid chromophobe renal cell carcinoma].  The paper describes a case of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma growing into the muscular layer of the descending colon and with metastases in 4 lymph nodes of paranephral tissue in a 66-year-old woman.
The tumor had a zonal structure with an alternation of epithelioid and sarcomatoid structural sites and with the signs of grades I, II and III according to the grading system by Paner and et al.
(2010).  The sarcomatoid renal component occupied about 70.0% of the tumor.
There was a pronounced immunohistochemical reaction with VEGF-A (5 scores), a high Ki-67 proliferation index (70%), and a large number of tumor cells with nuclear p53 expression (85%) in the areas with minimal differentiation and sarcomatoid elements (Grade III).
These signs can serve as criteria for the aggressive behavior of the tumor.
A large volume of the sarcomatoid carcinoma component and a strong reaction with VEGF-A are indications for targeted therapy with anti-VEGF drugs.
