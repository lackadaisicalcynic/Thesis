[The analysis of the commission forensic medical expertises concerning charges against healthcare providers].  This article as designed to present the results of the many-year analysis of the results and procedures of commission medical expertises concerning charges against healthcare providers as exemplified by the activities in these fields carried out by the Saint-Petersburg Bureau of Forensic Medical Expertise.
The analysis has demonstrated the well apparent tendency toward the growth in the number of expertises necessitated by the constantly increasing frequency of private claims and complaints in connection with the inadequacy and/or poor quality of medical assistance provided for the population.
This growth may be attributable either to the enhanced activities of the judicial and investigation governmental bodies (including the increased frequency and periodicity of the planned inspections of the cases of lethal outcomes) or to the more active behavior of the patients themselves exhibiting a greater than during the preceding period concern about their health status (or both).
