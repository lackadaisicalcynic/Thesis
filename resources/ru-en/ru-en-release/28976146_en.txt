[The effect of intracerebral transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells on orientation and exploratory behavior of aged animals].
Male Wistar-Kyoto rats (12 and 22-24 months old) were intracerebrally transplantated with syngeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).
Three weeks or one year later, orientation and exploratory behavior of the same animals (not 2 years old) was assessed using an «open field» test.
Older rats (22-24 months old) were inhibited in the basic behavioral acts in comparison to younger animals (2-3 months old).
Transplantation of MSC did not cause improvement of an orientation and exploratory behavior of aged rats.  Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis suggests intracerebral MSC transplantation led to the injury of the cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere.
