[Neurotrauma as a factor of epileptogenesis].  The presented article deals with traumatic brain injury, which can cause convulsive seizures with the subsequent development of epilepsy, which is especially characteristic of young people.
The problems of classification of posttraumatic epileptic seizures, development of their mechanisms, characteristics of diagnosis, as well as the stages of epileptogenesis leading to the development of traumatic epilepsy are considered.
The variants of therapy are given in view of traumatic brain injury.  It is noted that the use of electrical stimulation during individual phases of paroxysmal oscillations can be an effective method in preventing the development of homeostatic plasticity that is involved in the development of epileptogenesis.
