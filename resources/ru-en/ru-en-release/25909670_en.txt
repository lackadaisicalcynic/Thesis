[Pedagogical rehabilitation of deaf pre-school children following cochlear implantation].  This publication was designed to summarize the results of the long-term study with the purpose of developing a scientific and methodological approach to rehabilitation of the children having cochlear implants.
The main emphasis is laid on the initial (launching) stage of rehabilitative measures aimed at the reconstruction of the sensory basis of communication and interaction with the surrounding hearing subjects taking into consideration peculiarities of the children who experienced the loss of hearing late in their life and deaf children with different levels of speech development.
The main corrective measures are described to be taken at the initial stage of rehabilitation of the young and pre-school children unable to speak by the time of prescribed cochlear implantation.
The markers of completion of the initial phase of the rehabilitative period are identified indicating transition of a child toward the normal development as a result of cochlear implantation.
The author discusses the results of corrective pedagogical measures that can be achieved by their adequate organization and consistent implementation.
