[The new technologies of kinesiotherapy for the rehabilitation of the patients suffering from the post-stroke locomotor disorders].  This paper was designed to report the results of the application of two therapeutic modalities for the rehabilitation of 44 patients presenting with post-stroke locomotor disorders in the form of spastic hemiparesis.
The patients allocated to the main group were treated with the use of the new kinesiotherapeutic methods including cryomassage and the Armeo robotic complex.  The patients of the control group had to perform traditional therapeutic physical exercises in combination with classical massage and remedial gymnastics.
It is concluded that the application of the combination of the modern kinesiotherapeutic factors exerting the positive corrective influence on different aspects of the locomotor deficiency in the upper extremities and the psychoemotional status of the patients has advantages over traditional physical exercise therapy in terms of clinical efficiency because it enhances the rehabilitative potential for these patients with serious locomotor problems.
