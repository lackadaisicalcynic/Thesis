[The development and validation of the method for the identification of ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate as the markers of the consumption of ethyl alcohol during one's lifetime].  The objective of the present study was the development and validation of the rapid reproducible method for the identification of ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate allowing to store and transport the study specimens without the loss of the substances of interest by placing the samples on the paper.
We have developed the validated technique for the detection and quantitative determination of ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate in the cadaveric blood and urine by means of low-resolution tandem mass-spectroscopy with the use of deuterated derivatives of these substances as the internal standards.
The low threshold for quantitative determination of both above substances is 50 ng/ml for the blood and 100 ng/ml for the urine.  The method is characterized by the accuracy and precision with the coefficient of variation below 15% and the influence of the matrix with the coefficient of variation below 15%.
The evaluation of stability of the two analytes in blood when stored in the dry condition on the paper carrier during 2 weeks showed that the coefficient of variation did not exceed 6.4%.
The comparative study of ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate in the samples of cadaveric blood and urine containing from 0 to 5.2% of ethyl alcohol was carried out.
The methods for the transportation of the biological fluids and for the extraction of ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate placed on the paper carrier (Whatman 903) have been proposed.
The possibility has been demonstrated to use ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate as the markers of the consumption of ethyl alcohol during one's lifetime for the purpose of investigation of the putrifactive changes of the blood components.
