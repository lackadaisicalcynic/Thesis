[Application of semi-buried curvilinear distraction devices in complex management of lower micrognathia in children].
The aim of the study was to apply an effective treatment protocol with low morbidity for children with syndromic and nonsyndromic micrognathia using curvilinear distractors, intraoral approach and early orthodontic treatment.
We report 7 patients aged from 3 to 13 years with bilateral mandibular hypoplasia.  These patients were characterized by severe malocclusion, esthetic facial deformation and respiratory disorders.
In 3 patients mandibular hypoplasia was combined with anterior open bite.  The intraoral surgical approach was used in all cases.
Good functional and esthetic results were achieved during treatment.  The less traumatic intraoral approach, curvilinear distractors, ultrasound callus formation control and early orthodontic treatment assure the good functional and esthetic results in severe cases facilitating the continuinty in complex rehabilitation of the growing child.
