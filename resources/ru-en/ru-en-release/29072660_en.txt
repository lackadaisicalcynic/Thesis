[The role of a leukotriene receptor antagonist in the restoration of the nasal breathing in the patients presenting with polypous rhinosinusitis].  The present study was designed to investigate the clinical. laboratory, and morphological characteristics of the nasal obstruction process.
It included 87 patients presenting with polypous rhinosinusitis.  The dynamics of the serum leukotriene C4 (LTC4) level in the patients and the morphological changes in their polypous tissue suggested the existence of the pronounced exudative phase of allergic inflammation and provided a basis for the use of the leukotriene receptor antagonist in the form of the sodium montelucast tablets for the treatment of nasal obstruction.
