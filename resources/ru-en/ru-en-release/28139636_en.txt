[Treatment of asthenoneurotic disorders in children].
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy of cogitum in the treatment of asthenoneurotic disorders in children after bacterial meningitis (BM) or brain injury (BI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Twenty-four patients were examined.  Group 1 included 14 patients with BM, 8 boys and 6 girls, aged 7 - 12 years, mean age 9,91 ± 1,71 years; group 2 consisted of 10 patients with BI, 6 boys and 4 girls, aged 7-12 years, mean age 10,4 ± 2,36 years.
All patients received cogitum in dose of 250- 500 mg daily during 8 weeks.
Neurological and neuropsychological (Bourdon's test, Luria's tests) examinations, EEG, MRI were performed before and after treatment.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The study of cognitive functions showed a decrease in the accuracy and speed during performance of Bourdon's and Luria's tests.
After the beginning of treatment with cogitum, 80% of the patients in both groups demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of Bourdon's test (р<0,01) and verbal retention (р<0,001).
Repeated EEG (3-6 months after treatment) showed the distinct theta- , alpha-, beta- rhythms and clear zonal differences.
Given a spectrum of clinical effects of cogitum, the authors recommend it for active use in pediatric practice.
