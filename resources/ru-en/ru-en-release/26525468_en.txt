[The specific features of the anatomical structure of the artery of labyrinth (an anatomical and topographical study)].  The objective of the present work was to study syntopy of the artery of labyrinth using block-preparations of the posterior cranial fossa, variants of its branching-off from the vertebro-basiliar basin (VBB), and peculiar features of its anatomical structure.
A total of 12 block-preparations of the posterior cranial fossa were available for the investigation.
They were preliminarily stained with red latex and fixed in a three-point system.  These procedures were followed by retrosigmoid craniotomy, opening of dura mater in the supero-lateral part of the cerebellomedulllary cistern, traction of the cerebellum, and blunt separation of the basiliar artery (BA).
Variants of branching of the antero-inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) and branching of the artery of labyrinth from AICA were studied.
It was shown that the artery of labyrinth branches off from the antero-inferior cerebellar artery in 100% of the cases.
The latter artery formed a loop in 14% of the cases (3 ears).
The average diameter of the labyrinth artery was 0.32 mm and its mean area 0.06 sq.cm.
The artery of labyrinth branched off from the posterior para-stem segment of the antero-inferior cerebellar artery in 42.6% of the cases (9 ears), and from the anterior para-stem segment of AICA in 14.2% of the cases (3 ears).
Within the conventional «rhombus», the artery of labyrinth was straight in 76.2% of the cases (16 ears) and arc-shaped in 23.8% (4 ears).
