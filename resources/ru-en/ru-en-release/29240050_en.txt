[Antithrombotic therapy after bypass grafting below the inguinal ligament].  The importance of antithrombotic therapy following reconstructive operations on arteries below the inguinal ligament is beyond question.
The pharmaceutical market offers a wide variety of antiaggregant and anticoagulant agents, with many studies (including randomised and multicenter ones) performed worldwide on the problem of choosing optimal antithrombotic therapy in the postoperative period after arterial reconstructions.
Nevertheless, the problem of selecting adequate antithrombotic therapy after shunting operations remains undetermined.
Presented in the article is a review of foreign studies on the problem concerned.
This is followed by discussing the results of many large international studies, including such trials as the BOA and CASPAR.
Based on the findings obtained in these studies, Cochrane reviews, European and American guidelines, the authors express their opinion on the algorithms of choosing an appropriate variant of antithrombotic therapy during the postoperative period in patients after arterial reconstructions below the inguinal ligament.
