[TMJ disc displacement as a cause of changes in facial skeletal morphology].
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate an efficiency of TMJ open disc repositioning surgery with use of bone anchors.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
TMJ open disc repositioning surgery was indicated for patients with TMJ anterior disc displacement without reduction and skeletal class II or asymmetric forms of dysgnathia related to condyle resorption.  Surgery was performed on 9 patients divided into two groups: the first one (5 patients) consisted of patients that were seeking help for bite problems, the second one (4 patients) consisted of patients with signs of TMJD, such as decreased mouth opening and pain in TMJ area.
RESULTS
The first group patients underwent open disc repositioning and orthognathic surgery with counterclockwise rotation of occlusal plane.  All the patients showed stability in skeletal and occlusal elements at 6 months follow-up period.
The second group patients underwent disc-repositioning surgery only.  In all the cases pain was completely eliminated but there was no sufficient improvement in MIO at 6 months follow-up period.
Open TMJ disc repositioning surgery can be used for prevention of relapse after orthognathic surgery in patients with TMJ internal derangements such as anterior disc displacement without reduction.
