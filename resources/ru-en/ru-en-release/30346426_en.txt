[New method of brackets positioning for orthodontic treatment of dentoalveolar anomalies].  The aim of the study was to improve the accuracy of the positioning of brackets in the conduct of orthodontic treatment of the anomalies of the dentoalveolar system.
The developed method of positioning the brackets assumes a temporary fixation of the wire guides in accordance with the prospective longitudinal axis of the tooth before carrying out the orthopantomography (X-Ray picture) of the teeth.
According to the OPG (orthopantomography), the accuracy of determining the longitudinal axes of the teeth is estimated, and if the fixed wire guides and longitudinal axes of the teeth do not coincide, the angle is measured and corrections are made by moving their gingival part to the required value, then the impressions from the patient's jaws are taken and diagnostic plaster models having precise guidelines axis.
Brackets are fixed indirectly using a standard technique by aligning the longitudinal line of the bracket with the landmark indicated on the plaster model of the jaw.
The proposed method makes it possible to increase the accuracy of the positioning of brackets on the tooth surface during orthodontic treatment of the anomalies of the dentoalveolar system.
