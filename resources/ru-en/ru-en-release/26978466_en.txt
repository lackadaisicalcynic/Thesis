AIM  To study the results of deferoxamine (Deferal) administration in intensive therapy program of 63 patients with severe acute pancreatitis to decrease effect of oxidative stress and endotoxemia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In deferoxamine group (31 patients) there were decrease of serum iron's level and inhibition of free radical oxidation that led to early relief of endotoxemia, reducing periods of organs' dysfunction.  It was not observed in comparison group (32 patients).
RESULTS
Deferoxamine decrease risk of pancreatic necrosis and pancreatogenic sepsis.  It allows reducing ICU- and hospital-stay and number of extended surgical procedures.
