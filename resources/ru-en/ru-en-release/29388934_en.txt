[The application of the physical factors for the medical rehabilitation of the children presenting with neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder].  This article describes the modern technologies for the medical rehabilitation of the children presenting with neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder aimed at improving the act of urination at all levels of innervation.
The most frequent variant of neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder in the children is the hyper-reflexive one; it is this variant in which the most pronounced disorders of urodynamics due to intravesical hypertension and detrusor hypoxia are observed.
The urodynamic disorders are known to contribute to the formation of the characteristic clinical picture associated with the hyper-reflexive urinary bladder dysfunction in the children characterized by the mandatory urination syndrome, pollakiuria, imperative urges, and mandatory urinary incontinence in the combination with enuresis.  The treatment of urinary bladder dysfunction includes both behavioural and medication therapeutic modalities.
The "golden standard" for the pharmacotherapy of neurogenic bladder dysfunction of the hyper-reflexive type in the childhood is the use of M-cholinoblockers, such as oxybutynin.
The popularity of the physiotherapeutic methods is attributable to their influence on the main links of pathogenesis, the absence of side effects, and the possibility of application in the children of the early age.
The combined treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction includes the use of a wide range of physiotherapeutic methods the action of which is aimed at regulating the act of urination at all levels of innervation of the bladder, normalizing the tone of the muscles of the bladder, eliminating sphincter insufficiency, improving circulation and accelerating the maturation of the neuromuscular apparatus of the pelvic organs.
At present, the natural and preformed methods of physiotherapy are finding the wide application for the management of neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder in the children in the conjunction with therapeutic physical exercises, massage, and the biological feedback (BFB) technique.
