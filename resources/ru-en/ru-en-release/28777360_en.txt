[Contemporary approaches to the relationships between chronic pain and sleep].  Chronic pain represents the unique pathophysiological condition characterized by the sustainable chemical, morphological and behavioral patterns.
Sleep facilitates many chronic pain syndromes by the blockade of nociceptive ways, release of specific neuromediators and the absence of conscious perception in this time.
The restriction of sleep duration or disruption of its structure results in intensification of pain while the improvement of sleep leads to the alleviation of pain in some cases.
