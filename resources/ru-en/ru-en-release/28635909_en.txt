[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease concurrent with metabolic syndrome: Pathophysiological and clinical features].  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) still remains a serious public health problem, which is a common cause of disability and death in the able-bodied population.
Furthermore, the number of patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) is steadily increasing worldwide.
Recently, there is also an increase in the number of patients with COPD concurrent with MS, which is a mutually confounding risk factor for concomitant cardiovascular disease and adversely affects prognosis in these patients.  Systemic subclinical inflammation is a common link between COPD and the components of MS.
Systemic inflammation in patients with comorbidity is complemented by an inflammatory process in the abdominal visceral adipose tissue that serves as a source of proinflammatory adipokines (leptin, resistin, and tumor necrosis factor-Î±).  Patients with COPD in the presence of MS components have in general higher ventilation needs, more obvious clinical manifestations of bronchopulmonary diseases, and more frequent COPD exacerbations and frequently require higher doses of inhaled glucocorticosteroids.
As compared with normal-weight patients with COPD, obese patients with this condition have more limited physical activity and much more exercise intolerance.
There are currently no practical recommendations for the management of patients with comorbidity; patients with COPD concurrent with MS need an individual therapeutic approach.
It is important to elaborate a package of preventive measures to improve quality of life in patients, to reduce the incidence of systemic complications, and to achieve symptomatic improvements.
Thus, to develop and implement practical guidelines for physicians and patients are an urgent issue.
