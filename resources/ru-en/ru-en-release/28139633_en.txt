[Molecular mechanisms of pidolate magnesium action and its neurotropic affects].
AIM  A complex study of pharmacological properties of magnesium pyroglutamate using the modern methods of chemoinformatics and bioinformatics.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Pharmacological properties of magnesium pyroglutamate were studied using chemoinformatic and bioinformatic analyses.
RESULTS
Neurotropic effects of magnesium pyroglutamate are due to an influence on the synthesis of neuropeptides containing pyroglutamate (orexin, thyroliberin, neurotensin etc) and due to the similarity between pyroglutamate-anion with some neuroactive components (L-theanine, 2-pirrolydinone, piracetam).
CONCLUSION
The results of the study suggest neuroprotective, sedative and antidepressive properties of magnesium pyroglutamate which are realized by pyroglutamate-anion in the synergism with magnesium cation.
