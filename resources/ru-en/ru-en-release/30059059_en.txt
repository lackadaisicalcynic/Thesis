[Sleep disorders in chronic pain syndromes].
Sleep disorders and pain syndromes are widespread in the general population.  This review presents data on comorbidity of these phenomena and possibility of their mutual influence on each other including data based on long-term prospective studies.
Studies of pain syndromes and sleep disorders dynamics are analyzed in detail.  Anatomical basis of sleep-pain interactions is described, and results of the emotional influence on sleep and pain associations are presented.
Non-pharmacological and drug-based approaches to treatment with detailed description of the biochemical basis of their action are considered.  The authors conclude that pain syndromes and sleep disorders have reciprocal relations; the improvement of sleep quality helps in various pain syndromes; sleep normalization could play a preventive role with regard to pain.
