[The role of small intestine length in the development of short bowel syndrome].
AIM  To define the the role of small bowel length in development of SBS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Seventeen patients with SBS after small bowel resection in neonatal period were included into the study.  Total small bowel length ranged from 5 to 55 cm (11.8Â±5.59% from normal length for certain age).
RESULTS  Described small bowel length has high risk of SBS/IF development irrespective to other factors (specific segment of small bowel that was resected, preserved intestinal segment state, absence of colon and/or ileocecal valve).
CONCLUSION
It is required to perform further studies with greater amount of patients to discover exact small bowel length which is associated with SBS and other factors affecting small bowel state.
