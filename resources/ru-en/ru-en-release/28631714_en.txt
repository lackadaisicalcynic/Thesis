[Extrarenal rhabdoid tumor: A review of literature and a report of cases with atypical morphology].  Extrarenal extracranial rhabdoid tumor (EERT) is a rare malignant pediatric tumor characterized by extremely aggressive behavior, rapid metastatic spread, low survival rates, and no targeted therapy.
The morphological diagnosis of classical cases of EERT is not difficult and it is based on its characteristic histologic pattern and immunohistochemical findings in a relatively short time, which allows one to immediately initiate therapy.
The paper describes two cases of ERRT in the complete absence of classical rhabdoid morphology, as revealed by light microscopy when the material was primarily assessed.  The final diagnostic search could establish a diagnosis of EERT in both cases on the basis of immunohistochemical findings.
