[Corneal dystrophies].
The article reviews modern clinical, morphological, and genetic aspects of corneal dystrophies based on the most recent international classification updated in 2015.  Corneal dystrophies is a group of slow progressing, non-inflammatory corneal pathologies, most of which are characterized by variability of the associated traits.
The existence of such pathologies makes important their differential diagnosis from acute inflammatory processes of various etiology, which require urgent therapy.  Conservative treatment suitable for dystrophies is usually associated with disorders of the anterior corneal surface and employ symptomatic tactic (lubricants, epithelizing agents, soft contact lenses).
No effective etiopathogenetically targeted treatment is currently known.
In cases with significant visual acuity decrease, it is possible to perform phototherapeutic keratectomy, abrasive polishing of Bowman's membrane with diamond bur and various types of keratoplasty depending on the depth of involvement.
