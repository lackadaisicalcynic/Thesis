[Sacral resection in surgical treatment of locally advanced primary and recurrent rectal and anal cancer: short-term outcomes].  AIM
To assess safety of rectum removal with distal sacral resection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The short-term results of surgical treatment of primary and recurrent locally advanced rectal and anal cancer with sacral fixation have been analyzed.
32 patients underwent combined operations with sacral resection at the level of S2-S5.
In 12 patients only one point of tumor fixation (F1) was revealed, 10 patients had two points of fixation (F2), three patients had three fixation points (F3) and in 7 cases the tumor was fixed to four points (F4) of fixation to different pelvic structures.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Mean intraoperative blood loss and surgery time was 551±81 ml and 320±20 min in cases of sacral fixation only that was significantly lower compared with F2 cases - 1278±551 ml and 433±45 min, F3 cases - 2200±600 ml and 620±88 min, F4 cases - 2157±512.5 ml and 519±52,3 min, respectively (р<0.05).  Complications requiring surgical intervention occurred in 9% patients (n=3).
Among 23 patients with intact bladder and ureters urinary disorders occurred in 42% (n=10).  Resection margin was negative along posterior surface of the specimen in all cases.
CONCLUSION
Advanced surgery with distal sacral resection is advisable for radical removal of locally advanced and recurrent rectal and anal canal cancer fixed to the sacrum with negative resection margin.  These operations are feasible in specialized centers and should be performed by specially trained oncological or colorectal surgeon.
