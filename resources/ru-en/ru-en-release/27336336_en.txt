Takayasu's arteritis: followed the effects of therapeutic pharmacology by carotid ultrasonography.  INTRODUCTION
The carotid ultrasonography could be used to assess the effects of therapeutic pharmacology in the Takayasu's arteritis (TA).  CASE PRESENTATION
21-year-old female with a pulsatile headache and high blood pressure.  There were difference in the blood pressure between arms and a bruit over the carotid and subclavian region.
The CT angiography demonstrated arterial wall thickening of nearly the whole aorta and its branches.  We diagnosed the patient as having AT.
The immunosuppressive therapy was started.  The thickening of the left common carotid artery decreased from 2.5 to 1.5 mm.
DISCUSSION  TA is a large vessel vasculitis characterized by adventitial thickening, cellular infiltration of the tunica media, and intimal hyperplasia leading to marked vessel wall thickening, Ultrasonography is a noninvasive and effective method for evaluating the carotid arteries in patients with this disease and may be a useful method for follow-up of anatomic and hemodynamic changes in response to immunosuppressive therapy.
