[Surgical management of non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors].  AIM
To analyze immediate and long-term results of surgical treatment of patients with non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Outcomes in 21 patients with non-functioning pNETs were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS
Long-term results were followed-up in 18 (85%) cases, median follow-up was 39 months.
Postoperative mortality was 4.7%.
The incidence of postoperative complications Clavien-Dindo degree IIIA and over was 20.8%, overall 5-year survival - 89%, desease-free 5-year survival - 78%.
CONCLUSION
At present time surgical intervention remains the only radical method of non-functioning pNETs management.
Threshold tumor dimension should be 15 mm that determines surgical intervention or active surveillance.
From an oncological point of view tumor enucleation is permissible only in case of small dimensions (up to 2 cm) and full confidence in low degree of malignancy.
Lymphadenectomy should be performed in all cases in standard fashion because lymph node involvement is reliably poor prognostic sign.
