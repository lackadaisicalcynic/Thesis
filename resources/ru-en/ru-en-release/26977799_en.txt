[Pr—Ö-monitoring based decision-making about decompressive craniectomy in a patient with severe traumatic brain injury.  A case report].
The presented case illustrates a new approach to making a decision about decompressive craniectomy in the patient with sever traumatic brain injury and intracranial hypertension.  The approach is based on continuous assessment of cerebral autoregulation using Prx-monitoring in addition to monitoring of intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure.
Prx-monitoring enables timely detection of autoregulation failure and provides the opportunity to make a decision about decompressive craniectomy before starting such aggressive methods of intensive care as hypothermia or barbiturate coma.
