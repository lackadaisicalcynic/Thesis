[Indices of the antioxidant system and dopamine in blood plasma in the dynamics of microwave resonance therapy in patients with alcoholism].
AIM
To study effects of microwave resonance therapy (MWRT) on the level of dopamine and some indices of the antioxidant system of blood plasma in patients with alcohol dependence.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Dopamine, reduced glutathione, activities of catalase and superoxidismutase (SOD) were measured in blood plasma of alcoholic patients (50 men) before and after therapy.  Plasma of 25 physically and mentally healthy men matched for age was used as control.
RESULTS
In alcoholic patients in withdrawal state, the significant increase in dopamine (p=0.03), activity of catalase and SOD (p<0.05) as well as a decrease in reduced glutathione (p<0.01) in blood plasma in comparison with controls were found.
The level of dopamine decreased significantly as after conventional therapy, as well after the therapy with addition of MWRT.
After MWRT, the level of glutathione in blood plasma increased significantly and activities of catalase and SOD decreased practically up to the control level while after conventional therapy (without MWRT), the indices of the antioxidant system did not change significantly.
CONCLUSION
The inclusion of MWRT in complex treatment of patients with alcoholism contributes to the normalization of the activity of catalase and SOD and increases the level of reduced glutathione, but has no significant effect on blood plasma dopamine level.
