[The first experience of using a single-layer intra-abdominal collagen plate].  UNLABELLED
The aim of this study was to define the possibility of using a collagen substance CollGARA as a protective barrier between the polypropylene mesh implant and abdominal organs.  The drug is a sterile bioabsorbable membrane consisting of refolded equine collagen.
Indications--use as barrier separating adjoining tissues and organs in the areas of the abdominal cavity, where the formation of adhesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS  Were performed 10 operations in patients with ventral hernias with different localization.
8 patients had postoperative hernia in 2--linea alba hernia.
8 patients were operated open, 2--laparoscopically.  After intra-abdominal hernia repair was performed plastic mesh implant, delimiting it from the abdominal cavity membrane CollGARA.
Serious complications from the abdominal cavity and the surgical wound wasnt observed.
RESULTS
The first experience with intra-abdominal plastic polypropylene mesh implant coated with collagen plate indicates the possibility of applying this method in the future.
