[The significance of EEG in the evaluation of arterial hypertension treatment].  AIM
To assess the efficacy of the treatment of patients with arterial hypertension (AH) using electroencephalography (EEG).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Arterial pressure (AP) was recorded in 250 patients with AH, along with simultaneous recording of EEG with electrocardiography (ECG), computed CT of the brain, which did not reveal any pathological changes.
Patients were examined during AH elevation and after its normalization and improvement of general health state.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Normalization of EEG parameters depended only on the AH level was observed in systolic AH <140 mm hg and diastolic AD <90 mm hg in the improvement of general health state during 1-2 month.  AH normalization led to disappearance of monophasic spikes, synchronized to ECG R wave, an increase in Î±-rhythm index, absence of bilateral synchronized spikes.
The method of simultaneous recording of AH, ECG and EEG can be used for assessment of AH treatment efficacy and medical-social expertise of patients.
The method of biofeedback is effective only when used together with pharmacological treatment of AH according to current treatment standards.
