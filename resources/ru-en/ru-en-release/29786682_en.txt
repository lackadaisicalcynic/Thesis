[The implementation of the method of enhanced external counter pulsation for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases].  The cardiovascular diseases occupy a leading place in the structure of overall morbidity affecting the population not only of Russia but also of the majority of the developed countries throughout the world; they thus impose the heavy social and economic burden on both the public healthcare services and the modern society in general.
At the same time, systemic atherosclerosis is considered to be one of the most common, severe, and life-threatening condition.
Despite the presence of a large number of pharmaceutical and surgical methods for the treatment of this pathology, they are not infrequently lacking the desired effectiveness.
The use of the shunting operations and endovascular methods failed to radically resolve the problem of managing systemic atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis of the lower limbs.
A relatively novel approach which currently begins to find the ever increasing application for the treatment of patients presenting with cardiovascular pathology is based on the enhanced external counter-pulsation method although both the clinical and theoretical prerequisites of its application were developed rather long ago.
This non-invasive therapeutic method allows to increase the perfusion pressure in the coronary arteries in diastole and to reduce the resistance to the cardiac ejection in the systole.
The objective of this review article was to perform the analysis of the available literature publications on the use of the enhanced external counter-pulsation technique for the treatment of the patients presenting with the diseases of the cardiovascular system and to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this approach as well as the availability of the treatment for the patients.
