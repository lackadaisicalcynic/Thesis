[Ophthalmic Rosacea: etiopathogenesis and modern treatment methods].  Rosacea is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease with various clinical manifestations.
Primarily it is seen as a dermatological condition, but it's not uncommon for it to develop ophthalmological implications affecting eyelids, cornea and conjunctiva.
The article describes main aspects of its etiopathogenesis, variations in its clinical course and treatment approaches.
There is currently no universal treatment strategy for the disease due to its varying clinical manifestation, particularly of its ophthalmological form, differing severity of the pathological process, lack of knowledge about its etiology and pathogenesis.
Leading role in its pathological process belongs to disturbance of regulatory mechanisms of the vascular, immune and nervous systems.  Additionally, higher levels of metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can be observed.
Possible influence of a range of micro-organisms also hasnot been excluded.  Basic therapy involves both systemic and topical drugs.
The first include tetracycline antibiotics.
A new direction in Rosacea treatment that aims at structural and functional restoration of vascular endothelium, improvement of microcirculation and recovery of rheological properties of blood is angioprotector therapy, in particular with Calcium Dobesilate (Doxi-Hem).
Aside from systemic drugs, the ophthalmological forms of Rosacea are treated topically with anti-inflammatory preparations, immunosuppressants and artificial tears that are chosen depending on the symptoms' severity.
In cases with heavy corneal damage, various types of keratoplasty can be performed.
Collaboration between ophthalmology and dermatology specialists is necessary in order to choose adequate strategy for Rosacea treatment.
