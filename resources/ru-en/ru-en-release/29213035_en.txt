[Problems of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.  A view through the prism of time].
The authors present a comparative analysis of the results of the study of 72 adolescent patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), which were published in 2010, and a new sample of patients over the last 5 years with the publications of domestic and foreign authors.  Difficult clinical cases are described.
These data indicate positive shifts in the diagnosis and treatment of JME.  However, the question of diagnosis is still a hard problem for neurologists.
The questions to be resolved are: gender aspect of the disease, to what extent levetiracetam could be a drug of first choice and to what extent valproats could be replaced; monitoring of children born to mothers with JME, a role of paternal inheritance.
