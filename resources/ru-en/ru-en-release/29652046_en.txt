[Hydrogalvanic baths as a method of medical rehabilitation: a literature review and the prospects for the clinical application].  The hydrogalvanic baths provide a tool for the combined application of warm fresh water and low frequency electric current.
These procedures are suitable for both systemic and local treatments.
The mechanism behind their therapeutic action is based on synergistic effect of two therapeutic agents.
This article presents the literature and historical review of the method as well as the current concept of hydrohalvanic therapy.  The history of its development is associated with the improvement of the technical equipment and accumulation of clinical experience.
Numerous studies carried out up to the present time have demonstrated that hydrohalvanic therapy can be effectively applied for the treatment of diabetic angiopathy, rheumatoid and gouty arthritis, fibromyalgia, ankylosing spondylitis.
At the same time, the high potential of this method remains underestimated.
At present, one of the most promising approaches to its clinical applications is the treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathy caused by degenerative vertebral disk lesions.  The hydrogalvanic baths have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and decongestant effects, improve microcirculation, and reduce sensory impairment.
It is necessary to continue clinical investigations to obtain further evidence of the effectiveness of the method under consideration for the treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathy and to evaluate its short- and long-term effects.  Their results will hopefully provide an opportunity to include the hydrogalvanic baths in the programs of medical rehabilitation of the patients presenting with lumbosacral radiculopathy.
