[Meta-analysis of management of colorectal anastomotic leakage].  AIM
To identify the most effective management of colorectal anastomosis failure via analysis of available literature sources.
RESULTS
Systematic review included 20 original trials.
Effectiveness of redo interventions for colorectal anastomosis failure including open, laparoscopic, minimally invasive techniques (transanal drainage, endoscopic vacuum therapy, endoscopic drainage) was described.
Anastomotic failure rate was 6.5%.
Medication was effective in 57% (95% CI 34-77%) of cases.
Redo open surgery was applied in 43% (95% CI 23-66%) of patients.
Postoperative mortality was 21-27%.
Redo laparoscopic procedure was performed in 61% (95% CI 50-70%) of cases for anastomotic failure after previous laparoscopy, incidence of conversion was 12% (95% CI 4-28%).
Transanal drainage was effective in 85% (95% CI 61-94%) of cases, endoscopic vacuum therapy - in 82% (95% CI 74-87%), healing of anastomosis without need for colostomy was achieved in 16% (95% CI 9-26%) of cases.
Endoscopic clipping for colorectal anastomotic defect was effective in 73.3-77% of cases.
CONCLUSION
Redo surgery for anastomotic failure is associated with advanced mortality and need for permanent colostomy.
Laparoscopic approach reduces incidence of complications after redo surgery and followed by better functional outcomes.
Minimally invasive procedures are advisable for colorectal anastomosis failure without need for redo surgery.
However, effectiveness of these methods is controversial due to few reports and no comparative trials.
