[The specific clinical features of acute sensorineural loss of hearing associated with vertigo].  The objective of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of vertigo and to determine the type of the lesion of the vestibular analyzer in the patients presenting with acute sensorineural loss of hearing (ASNLH).
The secondary objective was to evaluate the possibility of the restoration of the auditory thresholds.  The results of the examination and treatment of 94 patients suffering from ASNLH are presented.
It was shown that the development of acute sensorineural loss of hearing was accompanied by unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy in 22.3% of the patients.  In 5.3% of these cases, dizziness could be attributed to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and canalolythias is of the posterior semicircular canal on the side of hearing impairment.
It is concluded that the presence of the clinical signs of lesions of the vestibular analyzer and peripheral vestibular dysfunction in the form of latent spontaneous nystagmus without gaze fixation and/or asymmetric nystagmus with unilateral weakness in the caloric test is a negative prognostic factor for the restoration of the auditory thresholds in the patients presenting with acute sensorineural loss of hearing.
