[Neurological disorders associated with HIV-infection].
HIV-infection is a common intractable disease which is often concomitant with nervous system lesions.  We considered the main mechanisms of nervous tissue lesions in AIDS, in particular, those caused by opportunistic infections.
The current data about the problem of neurological disorders in patients with HIV-infection, pathogenesis characteristics, HIV-infection complications, diagnosis and treatment strategy were analyzed.  Neurologic complications of HIV-infection is a valid reason for a decision to start a highly active antiretroviral treatment.
