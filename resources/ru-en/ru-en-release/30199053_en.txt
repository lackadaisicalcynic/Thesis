[Fast-tract: Therapist's role].
The modern model of inpatient surgical care of private and optimized state/govermental medical institutions allows us to change the paradigm of nosological attachment of the hospital bed to one profile of specialists for an adaptive model, when the wards can be reassigned depending on the needs of the hospital.  In such multidisciplinary medical centers with mixed hospital beds without a nominal distinction in the nosological departments, a new therapeutic service is being developed - hospitalists, which provide a consistent curation of hospitalized patients, compensation of chronic therapeutic illnesses with patient's preparation for surgical interventions.
Our work describes the experience of Fast Track recovery program with the active participation of a hospitalist in a surgical team, which is a new experience in the practice of Russian colorectal surgery.
