[The forensic medical assessment of the causes and conditions of the formation of the chilling injury].
The authors present the data of the literature publications and theoretical considerations concerning the causes and conditions behind the formation of the chilling injury.  It is demonstrated that the chilling injury develops as a consequence of a disturbance in the relationship between the hypothermic protection of the organism and the cooling potential of its environment.
The thermal balance of the human organism depends not only on the natural mechanisms of physical and chemical thermoregulation but also on the character of artificial thermoregulation including the man-made means of cold protection.  The critical evaluation of all the available data on chilling injuries to the human body gave evidence that the causes and conditions of their development can be highly multivarious which does not however exclude the possibility of their systematization.
