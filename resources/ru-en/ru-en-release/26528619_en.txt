[Clinical guidelines for the use of intraoperative fluorescence diagnosis in brain tumor surgery].  In this paper, we present a review of current literature on the application of intraoperative fluorescence diagnosis and fluorescence spectroscopy using 5-aminolevulinic acid in surgery for various types of brain tumors, both alone and in combination with other neuroimaging methods.
Authors' extensive experience with these methods allowed them to develop a set of clinical guidelines for the use of intraoperative fluorescence diagnosis and fluorescence spectroscopy in surgery of brain tumors.
