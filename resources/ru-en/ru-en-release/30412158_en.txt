[The effect of spinal cord stretching on development of spondylogenic cervical myelopathy associated with kyphotic spinal deformity].
OBJECTIVE
The study objective was to specify the role of spinal cord stretching in the pathogenesis of spondylogenic cervical myelopathy associated with kyphotic spinal deformity.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We analyzed long-term outcomes of surgical treatment for spondylogenic cervical myelopathy accompanied by kyphotic spinal deformity.
RESULTS  The surgical treatment outcomes were significantly better (p<0.000001) in the case of simultaneous decompression/correction of kyphotic deformity and spine stabilization.
CONCLUSION
Spinal cord stretching associated with kyphotic spinal deformity significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of clinical manifestations of spondylogenic cervical myelopathy.
