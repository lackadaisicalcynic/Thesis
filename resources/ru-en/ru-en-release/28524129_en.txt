[Penetrating orbitocranial injury: a review of the literature and a case report of injury by a watercolor brush in a 3-year-old child].
We present a rare case of orbitocranial penetrating injury by a watercolor brush in a 3-year-old child.  Injuries of this localization can affect important orbital structures (eyeball, blood vessels, nerves, muscles) and cause severe intracranial damages.
In some cases, diagnosis of these injuries in children may be difficult due to the lack of marked clinical manifestations.
The presented clinical case illustrates the approaches for choosing methods for diagnosis of injury in childhood and subsequent treatment options.
