[Catecholamine excretion in patients with eating disorders].
OBJECTIVE
To compare clinical features of eating disorders and parameters of monoamine metabolism.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 21 patients with eating disorders during 2008-2011 using clinical/psychopathological method.  To evaluate the status of monoamine neuromediator system, urine levels of dopamine, noradrenalin and adrenaline excretion were measured using high-yield liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.
The reference group included 26 sex- and age-matched volunteers.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The common patterns of the pathogenesis of compulsive urges of different origin were identified.
The results indicate not only nonspecific changes in catecholamine systems of patients with eating disorders associated with different stress disorders but also demonstrate the pathogenetic correlations between dopaminergic activity and clinical symptoms of addiction.
