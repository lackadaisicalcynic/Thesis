[Release-active antibodies to S100 protein are able to improve the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis].  AIM
To reveal the effects of release-active antibodies to S100 protein in an animal model of multiple sclerosis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty female Wistar rats, aged 12 weeks, were included in the study.  The pathology was induced by subcutaneous injection of the spinal cord homogenate.
Afterwards the rats received a water solution of release-active antibodies to S100 protein (2,5 ml/kg/day, tenoten) or distilled water intragastrically during 30 days.  Intramuscular injections of glatiramer acetate (4 mg/kg/day, copaxone) were used as a positive control.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Release-active antibodies to S100 protein enhanced the latency period of the disease, reduced its peak intensity and compensated the loss of body weight of the animals.
The experimental drug effect was similar to the results of copaxone injections.
