[The remote post-graduate education in otorhinolaryngology: the first results and further prospects].  The objective of the present work was the retrospective analysis of the efficiency of two courses of remote education of otorhinolaryngologists in the real-time mode based on the results of the on-line questionnaire study.
We analyzed the data obtained during the implementation of the pilot project of the remote post-graduate education at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology,Russian Medical Academy of Post-Graduate Education making use of the independent Internet resource for the professional training of otorhinolaryngologists.
The two programs of remote education realized in 2012 and 2013 involved 7.9% of all otorhinolaryngologists practicing in the Russian Federation.
The fraction of those who passed through all stages of the learning process increased almost two-fold, that is from 10% in 2012 up to 19% in 2013.  About 14% of the participants made themselves familiar with all program modules; this result is in agreement with the data obtained in mass on-line remote teaching of the non-medical audience.
It is concluded that the results of the present study provide a basis for the elaboration of the remote education programs for the training of specialists not only in otorhinolaryngology but also in other fields of medicine.
