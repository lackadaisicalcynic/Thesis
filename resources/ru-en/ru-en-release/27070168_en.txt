[A place of intravenous immunoglobulins in current clinical practice: Privigen is a novel 10% immunoglobulin].  Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) were initially designed to treat patients with primary immunodeficiencies (PID).
Due to the multidirectional effect of IVIGs on the immune system, a range of nosological entities, in which these agents are successfully administered, is steadily expanding.
As of now, IVIGs are successfully used in neurology, rheumatology, hematology, and oncology and they are essential drugs for many patients.  In spite of the long experience with IVIGs, their mechanism of action remains unclear, numerous investigations for their clinical introduction are being continued.
Therefore, there is a growing need to increase the production of the drugs, which gives rise to the emergence of novel medications, which differ in their composition and manufacture technologies, on the pharmacological market.
The 10% intravenous immunoglobulin privigen, the safety and efficacy of which has been proven in foreign practice, is a novel drug on the Russian market.
