[Stress final element analysis at the abatement-implant-bone interface].  UNLABELLED  According to a research  AIM  we carried out the comparative final element analysis of stress in implant construction and the bone surrounding it.  The best result showed implants with platform switching and cone interface between implant and abatement.
Such combination of elements allows maintaining implant construction stability and decrease the load on cortical bone.
