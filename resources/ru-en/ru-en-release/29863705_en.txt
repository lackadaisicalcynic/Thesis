[Therapy of myofascial pain syndrome face with thioctic acid].  Authors present a case-report of a 36-year-old patient with pain syndrome in the face region (craniomandibular dysfunction with occlusive disorders) involving pericranial muscles and shoulder girdle muscles.
Thioctic acid was prescribed as a basic therapy, and relaxation tire, mimic gymnastics, post-isometric relaxation, vitamin and mineral complex were additionally used.  Thioctic acid was prescribed according to the following scheme: stage I - intravenous injections of thioctic acid (600 mg/daily, 5 procedures, every other day); stage II - oral administration of the drug in the dose of 600 mg/daily for 3 months.
A significant reduction of pain syndrome and the palpable tension of muscles were noted; the symmetric even muscle tone was revealed.  This case-report demonstrates the high efficacy of thioctic acid in treatment of patients with craniomandibular disorders using the 2-stage scheme.
