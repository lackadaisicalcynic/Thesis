[Integrated approach to correction enteral insufficiency in early postoperative period].
AIM  The purpose of the research was to study the effectiveness of enteral insufficiency correction at an acute peritonitis by applying minimally invasive techniques, electrical stimulation and rehabilitation of the bowel and abdominal intestine using Remaxol drug.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The analysis of the results of clinical and laboratory examination and treatment of 110 patients with acute diffuse peritonitis.
In the comparison group (62 patients) in the early postoperative period applied standardized treatment, including software reorganization of the abdominal cavity, in the study group (48 patients) -- a comprehensive treatment that includes software laparoscopic sanation abdominal electrical stimulation of the duodenum, and intra-abdominal (single dose, 200 ml), and intracolonic (200 ml, 2 times daily) administration Remaxol.  It was noted a significant improvement in treatment outcomes, including reduced mortality by 2.3 times, the shortening of hospital stay by 1.3 times.
RESULTS  The major component of the positive effect of the developed scheme of therapy is its ability to promptly arrest the effects of enteral insufficiency, maintain the functional status of the liver.
The relatively rapid recovery of motor and intestinal barrier function leads to a lowering of enteral insufficiency syndrome, which along with increased liver detoxification ability underlies the significant reduction of endogenous intoxication in three days.
An important contribution to the effectiveness of the treatment makes intra and intracolonic administration Remaxol.
The drug, possessing antioxidant, antihypoxic, hepatoprotective effects, contributes to the relatively rapid improvement of the barrier function of the peritoneum and intestines, detoxification ability of the liver recovery that significantly contributes to the relief of endogenous intoxication.
