[Coexistence of pulmonary sarcoidosis and primary Sjögren's syndrome].  The paper describes a case of a rare coexistence of primary Sjögren's syndrome (PSS) and sarcoidosis in a 41-year-old female with histologically verified lung and locomotor system diseases and keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
PSS was diagnosed based on the 2012 ACR classification criteria, in the framework of which serological, histological, and gland function tests and instrumental diagnostic methods were performed.
The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was based on clinical, radiographic, and histological findings.
