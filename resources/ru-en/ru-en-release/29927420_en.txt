[Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow in severe diffuse axonal brain injury: the role of neuroanatomical factors].  Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (ACBF) is a system of mechanisms for maintaining stable adequate perfusion of the brain despite changes in systemic arterial pressure.
In recent years, new data on the numerous metabolic and systemic mechanisms of cerebral blood flow regulation have been obtained, but the role of neurogenic regulation has not yet been fully understood and, therefore, not considered in clinical practice.
AIM  The study aim was to assess the effect of anatomical injuries to deep brain structures on the extent and duration of ACBF abnormalities in a model of severe diffuse axonal injury (DAI).
RESULTS
The study demonstrated that brain injury in the projection of a dopaminergic structure (substantia nigra) and a cholinergic structure (nucleus basalis of Meynert region) was more common in patients with impaired ACBF and was associated with a longer duration of the impairment.
CONCLUSION
The obtained data may indicate the presence of central (neurogenic) pathways of cerebral vessel tone regulation; traumatic injury of the pathways leads to a more severe and prolonged period of impaired ACBF.
Probably, injury to these regulatory structures in some patients has an indirect effect on the course of intracranial hypertension.
Further experimental and clinical studies in this direction are needed to elucidate all elements of neurogenic regulation of cerebral vessel tone and ACBF mechanisms.
