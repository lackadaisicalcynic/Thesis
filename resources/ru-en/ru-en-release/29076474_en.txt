[Topical respiratory strategies in neurocritical care].  Management of the respiratory tract and maintenance of adequate gas exchange are the basic goals of critical care.
Injury to the nervous system is often accompanied by development of respiratory disorders.
On the other hand, changes in the gas composition of arterial blood can cause brain damage.
In addition, approaches to the patient with respiratory failure, which are used in general critical care and neurocritical care, may differ.
The presented literature review is devoted to modern respiratory strategies used in neurocritical care.
