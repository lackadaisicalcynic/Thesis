[Adrenocortical oncocytoma].  The paper characterizes adrenocortical oncocytoma, a rare adrenal tumor, accompanied by Cushing's syndrome and estrogen and androgen production and provides histological and immunohistochemical features.
The authors describe their observation of a 33-year-old female woman.
It is shown that estimation of the malignant potential of adrenocortical oncocytomas requires a special approach and must be done using the Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia criteria.
