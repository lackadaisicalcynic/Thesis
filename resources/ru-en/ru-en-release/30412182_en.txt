[The modern state and prospects of development of endoscopic otosurgery].  In this review presents data on efficiency endoscopic operations at some ear diseases.
Now endoscopic operations are widely applied at primary and residual (or recuring) middle ear cholesteatomas, tympanic membrane perforation, otosclerosis and cochlear implantation.  Proceeding from resolving power of endoscopic technology, endoscopic operation can be applied as an independent method, or as an endoscopic assisted, to be combined with otomicrosurgery operation.
Efficiency of endoscopic operation in many respects is defined by a possibility of panoramic visualization of anatomical structures of middle and inner ear, and also carrying out high-quality elimination of focus lesion from areas, being remote when performing otomicrosurgery operation.
