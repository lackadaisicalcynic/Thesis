[The application of electrolaser myostimulation and laserophoresis of biologically active compounds in sports medicine (a review)].  This scientific review highlights peculiarities of the delivery of laser radiation to the tissues of the athlete's body by means of laser electrophoresis of biologically active substances and the possibilities for electrolaser myostimulation.
The main features of electrical myostimulation based on the application of laser-generated radiation are described.
The authors emphasize the necessity of taking into account the neurophysiological dependence of active and passive contractile muscular activity during training.
They provide the scientifically grounded rationale for the combined use of coherent laser radiation and electrical stimulation.
The list of scientific papers that confirm the effectiveness of the method being considered is presented.
The authors compare this method with other techniques for the induced ion transfer.
The beneficial influence of laserphoresis of succinic and hyaluronic acids on the athlete's body is reported with special reference to alleviating the pain syndrome.  A number of phyto-extracts used for the purpose of laser electrophoresis are characterized.
The authors demonstrate the application of the optional versions of this technique in various sports during the training and competition periods.
