[The significance of fibroblasts in experimental modeling of proliferative vitreoretinopathy].
AIM
to investigate the role of heterogeneous fibroblasts in the development of epiretinal membrane in eyes with modeled proliferative vitreoretinopathy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The material for investigation were 6 eyes of 3 Chinchilla rabbits.  Suspended fibroblasts (fibroblasts of the human skin - 200000 cells in 0.1 ml) were injected into the vitreous cavity via the pars plana.
The animals were followed up for 1 month and then made out of the experiment.  The eyes were enucleated and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for routine histological examination.
Microscopy was performed on the Leica system.
RESULTS  The main clinical and morphological criteria for a rabbit model of PVR induced by intravitreal injection of heterogenic fibroblasts have been established: epiretinal membrane formation, changes in intraocular structures (the retinal pigment epithelium and retina), and inflammation (due to transplantation immunity).
Particularities of the epiretinal membrane development and the role of different intraocular structures have been described.
CONCLUSION
The experimental fibroblastic model of PVR reproduces the final, fibrous, stage of PVR, which is significant for efficacy evaluation of antiproliferative drugs.
