[The relationship between neuroendocrine dysfunction and free-radical oxidation in old age alcoholism].
OBJECTIVE
to study the relationship between dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and free-radical oxidation in old age alcoholism.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 46 men and women, aged 60-80 years, with alcoholism.  Contents of cortisol, lipid peroxidation products and the level of an oxidatively modified protein were measured.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A decrease in blood cortisol content and correlations between its level and activity of free-radical oxidation were identified.
The severity of neuroendocrine dysfunction in old patients was sex-related.
It has been suggested that the impairment of HPA system activity may be a cause of oxidative stress and development of alcoholism.
