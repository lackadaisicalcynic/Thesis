[Hardware anastomosis in stomach cancer surgery].
AIM  To choose optimal technique of esophagojejunostomy in stomach cancer regarding reliability, functionality and simplicity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
145 patients with stomach cancer grade I-IV were enrolled.  They were divided into 2 groups depending on the type of the anastomosis (manual or hardware).
RESULTS
There were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of anastomosis failure, anastomotic stricture and reflux-esophagitis in long-term postoperative period.  At the same time, duration of reconstructive stage with hardware anastomosis was 26±11.3 min, whereas for manual stage - 72±21.9 min (p<0.0001) depending on surgeon's experience.
Hardware circular anastomosis in most clinical cases is an alternative to conventional manual anastomosis with the same reliability, safety and functionality.  Moreover, principles of hardware anastomosis are the same for open and endoscopic surgery that makes this technique universal and necessary for wide development.
