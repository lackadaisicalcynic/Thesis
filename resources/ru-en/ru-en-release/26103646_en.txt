[View on the problem of Klatskin tumor].
Klatskin tumor arises from the common hepatic duct and its bifurcation the bile ducts and is the most common primary malignancy of the biliary tree. the location of the tumor and its close relationship with vascular structures at the hepatic hilum have resulted in a low resectability and high morbidity and mortality.
Improvement of instrumental diagnostics and operative techniques allows to perform extended resection and complex interventions on the liver, bile ducts and vascular structures at the hepatic hilum.
The role of chemoratiotherapy and photodynamic therapy is not fully understood. thus, questions of treatment and prognosis of the disease are remain relevant and require further study.
