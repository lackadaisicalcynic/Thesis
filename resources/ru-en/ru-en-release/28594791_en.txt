[Prospects of clinical application of pharmacological imitation of the phenomenon of ischaemic postconditioning of the heart].
Pharmacological imitation of the phenomenon of ischaemic postconditioning of the heart appears to exert a cardioprotective effect in the reperfusion period.
It was determined that the protective effect may be carried out resulting from activation of the adenosine, opioid and bradykinin receptors.
However, there is yet no common point of view concerning the question as to the activation of what subtypes of the receptors the cardioprotective effect of adenosine, opioids and bradykinin is associated with.
The clinical findings strongly suggest that further studies are required, since the data obtained in the hitherto carried out trials are ambiguous, scarce, and sometimes yield contradicting results.
Several clinical trials of adenosine have been conducted and in the majority of cases positive results were obtained.
Adenosine administered in a dropwise manner was found to exert a cardioprotective effect.
However, not all researchers succeeded in demonstrating this protective effect.
Only one clinical trial was carried out with the opioid receptor agonist - morphine, yielding positive results, with morphine exerting a cardioprotective effect.
Feasibility of the clinical application of bradykinin as a cardioprotector is not of current relevance because of its numerous side effects.
