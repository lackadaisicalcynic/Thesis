[Planning of esthetic oral rehabilitation according to correlative analysis of clinical and morphological features of the marginal gingiva].  The orthopedic restoration and related to its clinical stages (preparation, gingival retraction, impression) is often associated with complications which arise from the marginal gingiva.
The technology of indirect ceramic restoration requires an assessment of the clinical and morphological parameters of periodontal tissues.  The study outlines correlation between the type of periodontal histhology and inflammatory and degenerative complications that has been established after the analysis of morphofunctional state of periodontal tissue.
Results of clinical studies and correlation analysis of clinical and morphological parameters of marginal gingiva has shown that important parameter influencing the choice of manufacturing technology are the position of restoration margin relatively to marginal gingiva and periodontal morphotype.
