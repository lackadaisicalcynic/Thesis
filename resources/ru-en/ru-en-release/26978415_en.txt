[Vaccination in patients with chronic renal failure in the pre- and posttransplantation period].  AIM
To clarify whether vaccination provokes renal graft rejection.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS  A total of 131 vaccinations were performed in 92 patients with chronic kidney failure (CKF), including 7 and 85 patients vaccinated before and in different periods after kidney transplantation, respectively.
The patients were examined using needle graft biopsy, measurement of proteinuria, and estimation of changes in blood creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate.
RESULTS
Vaccination was not fount to provoke rejection, as suggested by the results of needle biopsy of renal allografts and examination of their function.
CONCLUSION
Vaccination is safe for patients with CKF as it causes no rejection episodes.
