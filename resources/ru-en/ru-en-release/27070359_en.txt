[Diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitisoptica spectrum disorders].  The review is devoted to revised international diagnostic criteria for neuromyelitisoptica spectrum disorders (NMOSD).Current diagnostic criteria allow NMOSD diagnosis not only for serum aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G antibodies (AQP4-IgG)-seropositive patients but for AQP4-IgG-seronegative patients as well.
New criteria are expected to make NMOSD diagnosis earlier and more accurate as well as to facilitate the differentiation with multiple sclerosis.
Furthermore, unify international criteria should help to perform comparable epidemiologic studies and clinical trials of new drugs for NMOSD.
