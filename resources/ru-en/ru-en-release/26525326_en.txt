[The structure of childhood diseases in the patients presenting with hospital-acquired ENT pathology estimated based on the results of monitoring children's hospitals in Moscow].  The objective of the present work was to study the structure of childhood diseases in the patients presenting with hospital-acquired ENT pathology based at the results of analysis of the annual reports presented by the heads of departments of otorhinolaryngology of Moscow children's hospitals for the period from 2011 till 2013.
It was shown that pharyngeal pathologies predominate among the children amounting to 43.9% of the total ENT morbidity.  These conditions are followed by nose and paranasal sinus pathologies (29.2%), ear diseases (22.5%), laryngeal, bronchial and tracheal pathologies (4.4%).
The analysis of the internal structure of different classes of diseases was made separately for the ear, throat, and nose (ICD-10).
The results of the study give evidence of the tendency toward the higher incidence of selected forms of acute inflammatory diseases and chronic ENT pathologies in the childhood.
