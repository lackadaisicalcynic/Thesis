[Anxiety associated with substance abuse].
Substance abuse and anxiety is a common comorbid dyad and an example of so-called dual diagnosis in psychiatry.  Comorbidity of anxiety and addictive disorders may be due to interdependence of these states as well as common predisposing factors and pathogenic mechanisms.
There are various medicines in the treatment of anxiety associated with substance abuse, including benzodiazepines, calcium channel modulators, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics, antidepressants and antipsychotics.  One of the best approaches to the treatment of chronic anxiety disorders in drug treatment clinic is a long course of treatment with antidepressants, primarily with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first line preparations.
Such medications as pregabalin, buspirone, etifoxine and alimemazine are also of interest for the treatment of dual diagnosis patients.
