[Experimental and clinical rationale for the use of modern methods of teeth hyperesthesia treatment].  The aim of the study was to increase the effectiveness of treatment hyperesthesia of tooth tissues by improving medical and hygienic complexes based on the study of structural changes in dentin.
A two-stage study was conducted.
In the course of the experimental stage, the microstructure of the tooth dentin surface was studied in terms of its relief on an atomic force microscope in normal conditions, with hypersensitivity and under the influence of the studied preparations (Gluma Desensitizer, Tokuyama Shield Force Plus, Colgate SensitivePro-Relief, Biorepair Oral Care), the material for studing was human teeth with hypersensitive dentin (100) of 1-2 degrees and 25 teeth without hyperesthesia (control group).
In the groups for the clinical study were included 100 people with localized hyperesthesia of teeth I-II degree, which, depending on the medical-hygienic complexes used, were divided into 2 groups, 4 subgroups of 25 people.
The clinical efficacy of the proposed treatment regimens was assessed using indices: Schiff sensitivity, NRS pain scale, tooth hyperesthesia intensity and prevalence, OHI-S hygiene index in dynamics (before and after treatment, at 3 and 9 months).
As a result of the in vitro experiment it was established that after the use of professional desensitizers, the roughness parameters of teeth with hypersensitivity approach the values of a healthy tooth, and after using home remedies there is no qualitative change in the surface.
In clinical conditions, it was found that the means for professional use have a significant effect of reducing the sensitivity of teeth, the subsequent treatment of hyperesthesia of the teeth at home is necessary to achieve a stable result.
The obtained results allowed to optimize the pathogenetic treatment regimens for dentine hypersensitivity and to integrate the developed medical-hygienic complexes.
