[A study of the neuroprotective effect of mexidol on the cell model of glutamate stress].
AIM
To study a neuroprotective effect of mexidol on the cell model of glutamate stress.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cytological studies of an effect of glutamate stress on cerebellar granule cells were carried out.  RESULTS
Mexidol increased neuronal survival after the addition of glutamate by 8-10% (p<0.05).  The effect of mexidol was more pronounced at the stage of neuron culture growth (5 days), cell survivability increased on average by 20%.
CONCLUSION
The results of the study confirmed the neuroprotective effect of mexidol in the neuronal culture in glutamate toxicity model.
