[The use of spitomine (buspirone) in the combined therapy of panic disorder].  OBJECTIVE
To explore the efficacy of spitomine (buspirone) in the combined therapy of panic disorder, we studied the dynamics of clinical parameters and personality traits associated with development and maintenance of panic disorder during the treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty patients of a treatment setting for out-patients with panic disorder were enrolled in the study.  Patients received combined treatment with spitomine (buspirone) in the dose of 30 mg/daily (10 mg three times a day) during 6 weeks and individual short-term direct cognitive-behavioral therapy.
Anxiety and panic symptoms were measured with HARS, CGI, MADRS and STAI-A.
RESULTS
There was a significant reduction in panic and anxiety symptoms (by 50% on the HARS) that reached on average 9.73 scores to the end of the study.
This finding indicates the absence of anxiety and, therefore, therapeutic efficacy of the treatment.
Scores on state anxiety of STAI-A were significantly lower compared to baseline though the level of anxiety remained relatively high.  The partial decrease in trait anxiety, though its level was high as well, was noted.
CONCLUSION  The combined therapy of panic disorder with spitomine (buspirone) and cognitive-behavioral therapy is an optimal treatment, though not without the limitations of short-term methods.
Good tolerability of the drug allowed all patients to complete the study.
