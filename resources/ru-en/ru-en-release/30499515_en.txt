[Clinical manifestations of orbital lesion in granulomatosis with polyangiitis].
One of the most common and potentially threatening manifestations of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is orbital lesion.
PURPOSE
To study the clinical course and prognosis of orbital lesions of various localization in GPA patients.
Material and me-thods.
The study included 226 patients with GPA, 74 of them with orbital lesion.  Ophthalmic examination consisted of visual acuity test, biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, exophthalmometry and ocular mobility test.
Visualization was done using multislice computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance tomography and/or ultrasound examination.  RESULTS
Among the patients of the study group, in 35.1% the lesion was limited to dacryoadenitis, in 4.0% of patients - to myositis, and 70.8% had extensive inflammatory orbital masses.
Patients with orbital masses had systemic disease in 51.1%, compared to 7.7% in dacryoadenitis (p=0.00).
Clinical progression in patients with orbital masses was characterized by severe exophthalmos, periorbital swelling and hyperemia.
Patients with dacryoadenitis, on the contrary, had only mild symptoms.  Patients with orbital masses had unfavorable prognosis.
There were only three patients with myositis in the study group, so the data on them is limited; their clinical symptoms included light periorbital swelling, exophthalmos, strabismus, painful binocular diplopia and eye movement restriction.
The disease was recurring in two cases.
CONCLUSION
Patients with orbital involvement in GPA may have different course of the disease depending on the localization of inflammation.
