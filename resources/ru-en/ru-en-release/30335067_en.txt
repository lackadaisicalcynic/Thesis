[The prognostic significance of biological rhythms assessment in depression].
AIM  To assess the prognostic significance of biological rhythms in depression on the example of the individual chronotype.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred patients (women 68%), aged 18-77 years, mean age 48Â±16, were examined before and after 8 weeks of treatment.
The Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) was used.
Treatment response (a decrease of 50% in total MADRS scores to the 8th week of treatment) and dynamics of depression severity (dMADRS; R) were assessed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Evening chronotype was found to be associated with poor prognosis.  TCAs and SSRIs were more effective in eveningness, other antidepressants - in morningness.
MEQ changes during and after treatment may reflect the resynchronizing activity of antidepressants.
