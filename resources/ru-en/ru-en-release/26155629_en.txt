[Biological agents and fracture risk].  In patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatic ones, the risk of fractures exceeds that in the population.
Chronic inflammation is one of the most discussed and most important pathogenic factors of reduced bone mineral density (BMD), its worse quality and increased fracture risk.  The chronic inflammatory process contributes to the imbalance of bone remodeling toward bone resorption.
The use of biological agents in patients with rheumatic and other autoimmune diseases effectively suppresses systemic inflammation and increases BMD.
However, the effect of the biological agents in lessening the risk of fractures remains unproven.
