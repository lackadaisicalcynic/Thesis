[Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin with a complex chemical structure and various non-anticoagulant properties].
The paper discusses the non-anticoagulant properties of unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin and their relation to their chemical structures.  It is emphasized that enoxaparin has multiple, often interrelated, non-anticoagulant effects that can complement its antithrombotic activity and enhance the efficiency of therapy in patients receiving the drug for various indications.
The realization of these effects requires the complex structure with the standard distribution of molecular weight (Mw)  (average Mw, about 4500 Da, as well as Mw of less than 2000 Da (<20%), 2000 to 8000 Da (>68%), and more than 8000 Da (<18%), and with the standard content of 1.6-anhidro rings (15-25%), which is determined by the source of raw materials and by the production technology of the original drug and cannot be fully reproduced when designing its bioanalogues.
