[Transfusion supply optimization in multiple-discipline surgical hospital].
AIM
To define optimal variant of transfusion supply of hospital by blood components and to decrease donor blood expense via application of blood preserving technologies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Donor blood components expense, volume of hemotransfusions and their proportion for the period 2012-2014 were analyzed.
RESULTS  Number of recipients of packed red cells, fresh-frozen plasma and packed platelets reduced 18.5%, 25% and 80% respectively.
Need for donor plasma decreased 35%.  Expense of autologous plasma in cardiac surgery was 76% of overall volume.
Preoperative plasma sampling is introduced in patients with aortic aneurysm.  Number of cardiac interventions performed without donor blood is increased 7-31% depending on its complexity.
