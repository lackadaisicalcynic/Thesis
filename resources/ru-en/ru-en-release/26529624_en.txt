[SCT perfusion in the diagnosis of sellar and parasellar tumors].
UNLABELLED
The study is devoted to the use of a minimally invasive method of SCT perfusion for the differential diagnosis of sellar and pаrаsellar tumors.  Given a wide differential diagnostic range of tumors occurring in this area, the tumor perfusion indicators were used as an auxiliary diagnostic criterion.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study analyzed outcomes in 115 patients with various tumors of the sellar area who underwent surgery or biopsy for histological verification of the diagnosis.
RESULTS
The statistically significant differences were obtained for certain groups of tumors based on the values of hemodynamic parameters (p<0.05) that enable, with a high confidence, making a conclusion on the histologic type of most tumors.  CONCLUSION
These findings demonstrated that SCT perfusion is a highly informative method of the preoperative differential diagnosis of these tumors.  The sensitivity and specificity of SCT perfusion in the study were 100% and 81.2%, respectively.
