[New approaches to the treatment of keratoconjunctivitis sicca].  A new method has been developed for the treatment of severe forms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) that involves the use of an original cyclosporine A (CyA) saturated soft contact lens (SCL) together with preservative-free artificial tears therapy.  AIM
to evaluate the effectiveness of the newly developed treatment for KCS based on the use of medical SCL saturated with 0.05% CyA.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The patients (43 men, 60 eyes) with severe KCS were divided into 2 groups.
Group 1 included 21 patients (30 eyes), who received artificial tears and wore 0.05% CyA-saturated silicone-hydrogel SCLs.
Group 2 included 22 patients (30 eyes), who wore unsaturated original SCLs and received CyA instillations 2 times daily and, also, artificial tears.
Apart from a standard ophthalmic examination, the assessment included Schirmer's test, Norn's test, vital eye stain tests, tear osmometry, laser confocal tomography of the cornea, optical coherence tomography of the anterior segment with meniscometry, impression cytology of the conjunctiva, tear pH measurement, plating of the content of the conjunctival cavity, measurement of the width of the palpebral fissure, and calculation of the ocular surface disease index.
Treatment results were followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
RESULTS
The use of 0.05% CyA-saturated SCLs allows to halve treatment time for patients with severe KSC (down to 1 week - 1 month) as compared to unsaturated original SCLs in combination with 0.05% CyA instillations and to reduce it 5 times as compared to 0.05% CyA instillations only.
CONCLUSION  The new method of KSC treatment that involves the use of medical SCL of original design (ensures even distribution of 0.05% CyA across the ocular surface) and preservative-free artificial tears has demonstrated high therapeutic effectiveness as compared to existing methods.
