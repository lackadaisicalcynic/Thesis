[The spectrum of genetic alterations in anaplastic gliomas: and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas].
The work explores the molecular genetic features of anaplastic astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas in a series of 43 cases.
The mutational status was studied using domestic chemicals and reagent kits.  We revealed clear genetic differences between astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors and proposed an algorithm to study diagnostic and prognostic markers.
