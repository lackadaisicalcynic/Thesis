OBJECTIVE  To study peculiarities of the support therapy and factors hampering the compliance in psychiatric outpatients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We questioned 1042 patients with mental diseases and 580 persons in their close social environment using the method of anonymous social questionnaire.
RESULTS
The most of the respondents (78.2%) received "classic" psychotropic drugs, 21.8% - the drugs of new generations.
One third of the patients (37.56%) did not take the prescribed medicine.
The reasons for refusal were: polypragmasia (74.39%), poor drug tolerance (38.17%), the complex scheme of drug dosage regimen, the negative experience of the previous therapy (35.62%) and the lack of information about peculiarities of the disease (59.73%).
