[The relationship between the family structure and characteristics of the stress reaction in adolescent addicts].
AIM
To study the relationship between the family structure and characteristics of the response to stress in adolescent addicts.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 65 patients who used psychoactive substances and 42 healthy controls.
A set of psychological methods was used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  In the group of adolescent addicts, a low result was revealed on the scale 'family cohesion'.
A high level of development of such mechanisms of psychological defense as denial, suppression, repression, compensation, substitution, intellectualization and reactive education was diagnosed in both groups.
Significant differences were revealed only in repression.  Such stress coping strategies as self-control, escape-avoidance and problem-solving were more often used in the main group while confrontational coping, distancing, seeking social support, accepting responsibility and positive reassessment were used in the control group.
Lower indices of resilience in adolescent addicts compared to the control group.
