OBJECTIVE  To study clinical/psychological characteristics of neurasthenia and residual asthenia and to assess the efficacy of noofen and adaptol in the treatment of these disorders.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 30 adolescents with neurasthenia and 30 with residual asthenia.
The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), A.M. Vein questionnaire, Spilberger-Khanin questionnaire, The Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) were used.
Patients were divided into two equal groups (n=30), each included 15 patients with residual asthenia and neurasthenia.
Patients of the first group received adaptol in dosage 1000 mg daily and patients of the second group received noofen in dosage 500 mg daily.  The duration of the study was 30 days.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The significantly higher levels of fatigue, inattention and exhaustibility were identified in patients with residual asthenia.
Adolescents with neurasthenia were characterized by higher anxiety.
The higher efficacy of adaptol in treatment of neurasthenia (80% in adolescents with neurasthenia and 60% of patients with residual asthenia) was shown.  Noofen was more effective in treatment of residual asthenia  (66.7% of adolescents with neurasthenia and 86.7% with residual asthenia.
