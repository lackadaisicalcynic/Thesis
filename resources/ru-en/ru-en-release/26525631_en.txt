[The use of piribedil in early and late stages of Parkinson's disease].  In this article, we present clinical cases at an early stage of Parkinson's disease with mild affective and cognitive disorders, and at a later stage with motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesia.
The efficacy of dopamine receptor agonists in treatment of Parkinson's disease in the early and late stages is illustrated by the example of piribedil.
