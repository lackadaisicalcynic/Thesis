[Perampanel in pharmacotherapy of focal epilepsy: the efficacy and tolerability in routine clinical practice].  AIM
To analyze the efficacy and tolerability of the innovative drug perampanel (PER) as add-on treatment of focal epilepsy in patients older than 12 years.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty-six patients with focal epilepsy, aged from 12 to 63 years, mean age 31.7 years, were studied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A decrease in the frequency of all types of seizures by >50% was noted in 46,5% of patients.
Stopping of all types of seizures was found in 25.6% of patients, i.e. in every fourth patient, stopping of secondary-generalized seizures in 39.5%.
Adverse effects (AE) were identified in 13 (28.2%) of patients, including aggressiveness - 6 (13.0%); other AE were less frequent (<10%): sleepiness (8.7%), dizziness (4.3%), postural instability (4.3%), irritability (4.3%).
PER was withdrawn in 3 (6.5%) patients due to AE.
Mean effective dose was 6 mg/day.
Quality-of-life improved in the majority of patients (71.7%).
