[The strategies for psychological self-control of seizures in patients with focal epilepsy].
AIM  To investigate self-control strategies for epileptic seizures and their relationship to the individual coping-style in patients with focal epilepsy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Twenty one adult patients with focal epilepsy were examined.
Strategies for seizure control and coping-style were estimated with the CBES-SC and the Brief COPE scale, respectively.
The control group consisted of 20 healthy individuals.  RESULTS
86% of patients tried to control their seizures.
Most of the patients (33%) preferred to use behavioral self-management strategies, which reduced the consequences of seizure.  Patients with the high self-control activity more often had adaptive problem-focused coping-style in comparison to the patients with the low self-control (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION  The psychological coping-style modifying support can motivate patient to the wider use of strategies for seizure control and improve a psychosocial adjustment of the patient.
