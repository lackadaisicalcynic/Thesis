[Difficulties in the diagnosis of stroke in pregnant women].
AIM  To study the features of the clinical picture of stroke and results of laboratory/instrumental study in pregnant women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A study included 44 women at different periods of gestation (mean age 33.4Â±9.7 years) with clinical symptoms of stroke hospitalized within 4-11h after stroke.  Neuroimaging, clinical/instrumental and laboratory examinations were carried out in the first 40 min after admission.
RESULTS  A routine screening examination during the management of pregnancy in women's consultation clinics does not always reduce the risk of life threatening events.
The operative delivery can decrease the severity of the focal neurological deficit.  Intensive treatment and dynamic management of patients with intracranial pathology in intensive care stroke unit improves outcome of stroke.
CONCLUSION
A timely differential diagnosis of pathological conditions with different symptoms of stroke at the different stages of medical care of pregnant women helps to choose an optimal treatment plan and improve the outcome.
