[Concentration of proinflammatory cytokines, peroxiredoxin-1 and glutathione peroxidase activity in the blood plasma of patients with coronary artery disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting].  76 patients with coronary heart disease (who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting) were examined to investigate the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes involved in redox regulation, in the mechanisms of development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
Patients were divided into 2 groups: 1st - patients with coronary heart disease, who as a result of clinical trials has not been set postpericardiotomy syndrome; 2nd - patients with coronary heart disease who have been diagnosed postpericardiotomy syndrome.
The blood plasma of both groups indicated intensification of production of interleukin-6, intrleukin-8, as well as - an imbalance in the peroxiredoxin-1 and glutathione peroxidase.
These changes by patients with postpericardiotomy syndrome are observed at the earliest time and differed depth of expression.
The results of this work confirm the high potential of the investigated indicators for prevention and monitoring postpericardiotomy syndrome development.
