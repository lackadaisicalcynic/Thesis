[The results of open and laparoscopic appendectomy in pregnant women with acute appendicitis].
AIM
To compare conventional and laparoscopic appendectomy in pregnant women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 86 patients with acute appendicitis who were surgically treated.  In group 1 (42 women) laparoscopic approach was used, in group 2 (44 patients) - laparotomy.
RESULTS
Postoperative complications were observed in 2 (4.8%) and 3 (6.8%) patients in groups 1 and 2 respectively.
All complications related to Clavien-Dindo class I-II. There were no premature births and abortions in laparoscopy group.
In case of conventional surgery premature births and abortions were observed in 2 (4.5%) and 1 (2.27%) observations respectively.
Other women had timely childbirth in terms of 36-41 weeks.
CONCLUSION
Risk of delay exceeds risk of vain appendectomy.
All pregnant women with acute appendicitis should be examined by obstetrician-gynaecologist, surgeon, urologist, anesthesiologist.
If acute appendicitis can not be excluded based on clinical data the patient should be operated.  Diagnostic laparoscopy and laparoscopic appendectomy are advisable in case of pregnancy up to 24 weeks.
Woman should be under observation of obstetrician-gynaecologist in perioperative period to prevent premature birth and abortion.
