[Age-related changes in the expression of lamin B receptors in fibroblasts of human dermis].  The aim of this work was to study lamin B receptors in human skin at different ages.
Lamin B receptors, proliferating cells nuclear antigen (PCNA) were detected in sections of the skin by indirect immunohistochemistry.
Our results showed that both portion of dermal fibroblasts with positive staining for lamin B receptors and intensity of staining of fibroblasts for lamin B receptors were maximal from birth to 20 years as compared to all other examined age-periods (from 20 weeks of pregnancy to 85 years old).
General number of fibroblasts and number of fibroblasts with positive staining for PCNA in dermis were diminished with age.
The most significant decrease in the number of fibroblasts and PCNA positive fibroblasts were observed from 20 years old.  An increase in the level of lamin B receptors in dermal fibroblasts observed from birth to 20 years old may be regarded as one of start events leading to age-dependent decrease in the number of fibroblasts in human dermis.
