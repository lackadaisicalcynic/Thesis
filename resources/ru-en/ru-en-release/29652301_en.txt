[The results of an open comparative retrospective trial of the course of multiple sclerosis during treatment with infibeta and other interferon-beta bioanalogues and glatiramer acetate].
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the interferon beta-1b bioanalogue 'infibeta' in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) in comparison with other interferon beta bioanalogues and the generic drug glatiramer acetate.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The data of 500 patients with MS treated with different disease-modifying drugs were analyzed.  Patients of group 1 (n=95) received infibeta; group 2 (n=108) interferon beta-1b; group 3 (n=83) genfaxon-44; group 4 (n=109) sinnovex; group 5 (n=105) aksoglatiran FS.
RESULTS
In all groups, there was a significant decrease in the AARR and an increase in the EDSS score (p<0,05) after 12 and 24 months of treatment (p<0,05) with the best indicators in groups 1-3.
After 12 months of treatment, the number of patients without signs of MRI activity was higher in groups 1-3 (48-61%) than in groups 4 and 5 (47, 43%, respectively) (p>0,05). After 24 months of treatment, the number of patients without signs of MRI activity decreased to 41-46% in groups 1-3, and more significantly in group 4 (27%).
The percentage of NEDA-3 achieving patients did not significantly differ in the groups (23-32%) after 12 months of treatment.
After 24 months of treatment the NEDA-3 declined more in group 4 (19%), least of all in groups 1 and 2 (27, 25%, respectively) (p>0,05). In most cases, the observed adverse events were mild or moderate.
Flu-like syndrome was observed rarely in groups 1 and 4 (p<0,05).  Injection reactions were observed most commonly in groups 3 and 5 (p<0,05).
CONCLUSION
Infibeta, while retaining all the advantages of high-dose interferon beta, has the best tolerability profile, which makes it one of the optimal first line disease-modifying therapy for treatment of patients with MS.
