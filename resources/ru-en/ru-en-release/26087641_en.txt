[B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma].  B-cell lymphoma that is unclassifiable and intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL)--(UBL) is an aggressive lymphoma that has simultaneously morphological, immunophenotypical, and cytogenetic signs of both DLBCL and LB.
At the same time due to its biological characteristics and clinical manifestations, UBL cannot be referred to as one of the above nosological entities.
UBL has been first identified as an individual nosological entity in the 2008 World Health Organization classification.
The review details the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, morphological pattern, immunophenotypic and karyotypic features, as well as therapeutic approaches and prognostic factors.
