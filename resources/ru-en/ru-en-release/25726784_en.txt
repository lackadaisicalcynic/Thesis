OBJECTIVE  To study the efficacy and safety of cereton in the treatment of patients with chronic brain ischemia and moderate cognitive impairment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 25 patients, 16 women and 9 men, mean age 53,8 ± 1,3 years.
Moderate cognitive impairment measured with MMSE and HADS was found in all patients.
Quality of life was assessed with SF-36.
Somatic and neurological studies as well as brain MRI were carried out.
Inpatients received cereton in dose 1000 mg in 200 ml of physiological solution during 15 days, after the discharge from the hospital patients received 1 capsule three times a day during 3 months.
RESULTS AND СONCLUSION: Cereton had a significant positive effect on patient's condition including cognitive function.  Subjective effect was recorded after 5-6 days of treatment, more evident and stable effect was seen from the 15th day.
In the end of treatment, clinicians recorded "moderate" effect in 11 patients and "marked" effect in 8 patients (according to patients' reports, those effects were noted in 9 and 12 cases, respectively).
The drug was well-tolerated and had a positive effect on quality of life of the patients.
