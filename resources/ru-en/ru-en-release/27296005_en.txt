[Kaposi's sarcoma in the grafted lung].
The paper provides a clinical note.  A 45-year-old patient suffered from severe primary emphysema and underwent bilateral lung transplantation.
A year after surgery, exercise dyspnea again appeared in the patient.
Lung computed tomography revealed multiple rounded soft tissue masses; thoracoscopic biopsy and further histological examination proved the development of Kaposi's sarcoma in the patient.  The tumor disappeared completely following corrected immunosuppressive therapy.
After 22 months of transplantation, the patient died from gastrointestinal bleeding.  This case is of interest due to that Kaposi's sarcoma develops extremely rarely in the allogeneic lung after its transplantation.
