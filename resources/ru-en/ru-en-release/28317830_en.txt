[Experience of organ spare sialolitiasis treatment using sialoendoscopy].  The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of organ spare sialolitiasis treatment by sialoscopy-guided techniques.
The study included 317 patients with parotid and submandibular sialolitiasis.
In 22 patients conventional surgical approach was used because of distal location and larger size of concrements, while in 295 miniinvasive sialoscopy-guided procedures were performed.  The use of sialoscopy-guided approach drastically diminished the rate of submandibular glands extirpations (performed in 5% of patients), as well as early and long-term surgical complications.
