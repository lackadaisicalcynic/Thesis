[Evaluation of vascular reactivity to overcome limitations of neurovascular uncoupling in BOLD fMRI of malignant brain tumors].  The sensitivity of fMRI in identification of eloquent cortical centers in the case of large infiltrative growing tumors and pronounced peritumoral edema may be reduced or significantly limited in some cases.
The main cause is an attenuated Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent response (BOLD) caused by pathological vascular reactivity and subsequent neurovascular uncoupling of fMRI.
In our study, we attempted to overcome these limitations and increase the sensitivity of this technique in identification of eloquent cortical areas adjacent to brain tumors by using vasoreactivity features of a breath-holding test and including these data in the BOLD analysis.
Local vasoreactivity using a breath-holding paradigm with the same block design of both motor and speech tests was determined in 5 healthy volunteers and 3 patients in the preoperative period (two patients with high grade gliomas and one patient with single metastasis).  A coherence-based model was developed for analysis of BOLD fMRI, which took into account altered hemodynamics in peritumoral zones.
Obtained coherence maps demonstrated clinically more significant activation zones that were not seen with standard methods of fMRI processing.  Thus, neurovascular uncoupling that is known to affect the accuracy of the BOLD fMRI response adjacent to brain tumors may be partially overcome by including an independent measurement of vasoreactivity using a breath-holding test in the BOLD analysis.
