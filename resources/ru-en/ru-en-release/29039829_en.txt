[Factors for the development of persistent postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery under extracorporeal circulation].  AIM
To analyze the factors contributing to the increased risk of persistent postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS) under extracorporeal circulation (EC).  SUBJECTS AND METHODS
257 male patients aged 45 to 69 years with coronary heart disease (CHD) undergoing elective CABS under EC were examined.  In addition to conventional clinical examination, all the patients underwent neuropsychological testing 3-5 days before, 7-14 days and 1 year after CABS.
Persistent POCD was diagnosed if there was a 20% decline in cognitive domains at 1-year postoperatively versus preoperatively in 20% of the tests of an entire neuropsychological battery.  Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to identify the factors supposedly increasing the risk of persistent POCD.
RESULTS  It was found that high baseline cognitive status, early POCD after CABG under EC, low adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, as well as progressive carotid artery (CA) stenosis could predict with a high (85%) probability that persistent POCD might develop at 1 year after surgery.
CONCLUSION
The findings are suggestive of the multifactorial origin of persistent POCD, a significant role in the development of which is played by not only the preoperative cognitive status, but also by postoperative factors, such as the degree of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, early POCD, and progressive CA stenosis.
