[Open surgical treatment of a giant renal cyst on the background of an arteriovenous fistula of the right renal artery].  Presented herein is a clinical case report concerning open surgical treatment of an arteriovenous fistula of the renal artery with a large venous aneurysm in the hilum of the right kidney and a giant cyst of the upper pole in a 28-year-old woman.
The intraoperative findings revealed disunion of the arteriovenous fistula, followed by edge-to-edge suturing of the arterial defect.
The venous aneurysm in the hilum of the right kidney was dissected and sutured by the edge-to-edge technique, with the additional varicose renal vein ligated.
The postoperative period turned out to be uneventful with favourable convalescence and no complications.
The check MSCT angiography performed 3 months later showed that the venous aneurysm was thrombosed, with no evidence of arterial blood ingress revealed.
The excretory function of the kidney was preserved.
Also discussed in the article are variants of diagnosis and treatment of an arteriovenous fistula of this localization and complications thereof.
