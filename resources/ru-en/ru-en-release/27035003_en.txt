[Rebamipide: New opportunities of gastroenteroprotection].  This review paper deals with the prevention and therapy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastrointestinal mucosal injuries in patients with disease of the cardiovascular and locomotor systems.
Particular emphasis is laid on the new Russian drug rebamibide that is a stimulant of prostaglandin and glycoprotein synthesis and an inhibitor of the synthesis of oxidative stress products, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in the gastrointestinal mucosa.
The advantage of rebamipide over classical gastroprotectors is its proven additional effect on the small and large intestinal mucosa.  This drug has been registered and is actively used in a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, and China.
