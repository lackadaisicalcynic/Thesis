[The peculiarities of determination of 2-chloro-1,4-dihydrooxybenzene in the biological material].
The objective of the present study was to elucidate the peculiarities of the determination of 2-chloro-1,4-dihydrooxybenzene in the tissues of different organs and blood.  The analytical methods used in the study included TLC, GC-MS, and UF-spectrophotometry.
The study has demonstrated the usefulness of using acetone as an insulating solvent for the extraction of 2-chloro-1,4-dihydrooxybenzene from the biological materials.
It was shown that the compound being analyzed can be separated from the endogenous substances contained in the biological matrices on the "Silasorb C-18" columns, 30 mcm.
The method for the identification of 2-chloro-1,4-dihydrooxybenzene in the blood and organ tissues (such as normal and putrefied renal tissues) was developed.
The method permits to determine 0.26 mg and 0.30 mg of the substance of interest in 100 g of the normal and putrefied renal tissues respectively; in addition, it measures 0.22 mg of 2-chloro-1,4-dihydrooxybenzene in the blood.
