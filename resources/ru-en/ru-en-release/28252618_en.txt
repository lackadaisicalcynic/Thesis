[The progressive models of educational activities as a basis for the training of forensic medical experts of the new generation].
The authors interpret forensic expertology as a synthetic science and propose the models for the training of professionals in the field of forensic medical expertise.
They provide a rationale for the realization of such systematic training in the framework of the model of the three-level system based at the educational institutions of higher professional education.
Characteristic features of the existing standards of professional training in the sphere of forensic medical expertise are considered with special reference to the organization of education of future forensic medical experts based at the many-level programs adopted in the Russian University of People's Friendship.  The authors maintain that the integration of the activities of the Russian University of People's Friendship in the sphere of training of highly qualified forensic medical professionals and the potential of other leading Russian and foreign educational institutions in the close collaboration with the practical forensic medical facilities would provide a solid basis for the long-term fruitful cooperation for the modernization of the existing system of the training of forensic experts, its harmonization with the most sophisticated international programs, innovative scientific and educational technologies integrated into the system of management of the quality of modern laboratories of forensic medical expertise.
It is concluded that the modification of the system of professional education in the field of forensic medical education constitutes the strategic approach to the solution of the problem of professional competence in the sphere of forensic expert activities.
