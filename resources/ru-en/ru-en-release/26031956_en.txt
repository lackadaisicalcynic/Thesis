[Immunological aspects in spleen ruptures surgery due to closed abdominal trauma].  The remote results of immunity investigation in 30 patients after organ-preserving surgery and in 30 patients after splenectomy forspleen rupture are presented in the article.
Indexes of cellular and humoral immunity were normal and life quality did not differ from that in healthy individuals after organ-preserving operations with splenic artery ligation.
Splenectomy leads to deterioration of life quality and disorders in cellular immunity including decrease of T-helpers/inductors cells (CD4), immunoregulatory index (CD3/CD4) and general number of T-lymphocytes (CD3) in some cases on background of compensatory increase of normal killers (CD16).
It was observed significant decrease of IgG and IgM levels.  Values of IgA and cytokines IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and TNF remained normal.
Level of immunosuppression is reduced due to development of splenosis.
