[Pathogenetic aspects of the development of acute focal cerebral ischemia].  Current concepts on the main mechanisms of brain damage in ischemic stroke are considered.
Chemical regulation of physiological and pathological processes of maintaining cellular pool is supported by a multistep system that included compounds of different structure and complexity.
A complex assessment and comparison of the processes taking place during the development of acute local cerebral ischemia (necrosis, apoptosis, autoimmune inflammatory reaction, neuroplasticity) can help in the objectification and prognosis of individual characteristics of the course and outcome of ischemic stroke.
Understanding of the cascade of events that occur during the acute ischemic damage is critical for determining current and future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
