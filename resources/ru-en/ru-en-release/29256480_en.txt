[The possibility of three-dimensional modeling of the mechanisms of damage formation in the framework of situational expertise].  This article was designed to share the experience gained with the three-dimensional modeling for the purpose of situational expertise intended to reconstruct the occurrence circumstances and check up the alternative investigative leads concerning formation of potential injuries to a concrete person.
Simulation was performed with the use of the dimensionally scaled model of the place of occurrence as well as the models of the human head and body totally consistent with the anthropometric characteristics of the victim.
The results of this work made it possible to reject several potential opportunities for the formation of injuries to the victim and identify the most probable version.
