[Prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in outpatients in Rostov-on-Don: Regional results of the DIREG-2 study].
AIM  to analyze and summarize the data of the DIREG-2 study of the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) register in Rostov-on-Don versus those in Russia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The prospective disease registry study encompasses an epidemiologic, observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study estimating the prevalence of NAFLD in outpatients in Rostov-on-Don.  A total of 3200 patients participated in this study.
The investigators were 65 outpatient physicians.
Epidemiological data were obtained during two patient visits to the research centers.
RESULTS  The key result obtained from this study was the significantly higher prevalence of NAFLD in Rostov-on-Don than that in the general population (40.4 and 37.3%).
In addition to the higher prevalence of NAFLD, there was also a higher spread of risk factors (RFs), such as abdominal obesity, female age of 45-55 years, and hyperlipidemia.  CONCLUSION
The prevalence of NAFLD in the outpatients of Rostov-on-Don was 3.1% greater than that in Russia; this might be due to the significantly higher spread of some RFs (abdominal obesity, female age of 45-55 years, hyperlipidemia).
The findings are undoubtedly necessary for the elaboration of measures for the primary and secondary prevention of NAFLD in Rostov-on-Don.
