[Study on the influence of whitening toothpastes on the nanocomposite material surface].
The influence of whitening toothpastes on the surface of nanocomposite dental restorative materials (24 samples divided in 3 groups according to type of toothpaste used) was studied using optical profilometry.
The most significant changes on the surface roughness of the material caused abrasive whitening toothpaste in comparison to enzymes-based paste.  Selection and use of whitening toothpastes in patients with dental restorations must be carried out under dentist's supervision.
