[Eye as an object of investigation of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease].
AIM  To study visual and spatial disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and eighteen patients with PD and 30 healthy people (the control group) were studied.
All participants underwent neurological and ophthalmological examinations.  PD progression was assessed using The Hoehn and Yahr scale.
MMSE, FAB and other psychological tests were administered.  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and MRI of the brain were performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The relationship of the variation in the thickness of various parts of the retina and brain cortex with cognitive deficit that manifests itself as visual-spatial disturbances is shown.
The complex diagnostic technique, including neuropsychological and instrumental method (OCT of the retina, MRI of the brain with MRI-morphometry), should be used.
