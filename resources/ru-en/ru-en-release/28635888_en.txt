[Adiponectin in health and disease].  Over the past 20 years after the discovery of adiponectin, much knowledge about its effect in health and disease has been gained.
Adiponectin has antidiabetic, antiatherogenic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, metabolic, vasoprotective, and antiapoptotic properties.
However, an understanding stems from the given literature review that much remains to be explored.
Adiponectin has not yet commonly used in clinical practice, but cardiologists, endocrinologists, pediatricians, oncologists, and physicians of many specialties are interested in its preventive and therapeutic applications.
