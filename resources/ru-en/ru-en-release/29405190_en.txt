[The characteristic of protein biosynthesis in brain neurons with chronic alcohol intoxication].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the possibilities for the use of the changes in the AgNOR staining patterns in the neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) for the purposes of the medical differential diagnostics of the cases of death from chronic alcohol intoxication.
We elucidated the characteristics of the activity of protein biosynthesis including the number and the area of the nucleoli in the nuclei of the neurons of the individuals who had died from chronic alcohol intoxication (n=20) in comparison with the subjects of the control group (n=13).
To reveal the morphological structures associated with protein biosynthesis in the nucleoli of the serotoninergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus in the brain, the histological preparations were stained with the use of the silver-staining technique for nucleolar organizer regions (AgNOR).
The comparative statistical analysis of the results thus obtained with the calculated confidence coefficients was carried out.
The aggregated analysis of all the dorsal raphe subnuclei revealed the impairment of the AgNOR staining characteristics in the neurons of the subjects who had died from chronic alcohol intoxication in comparison with those of the subjects comprising the control group.
It is concluded that the results of the study can be used for differential diagnostics of deaths from chronic alcohol intoxication and other causes.
