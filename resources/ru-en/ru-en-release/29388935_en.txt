[Physical therapy: prospects for the systematic development].  The author presents a review of the experimental and clinical studies that have formed the basis of modern physiotherapy as a science, academic discipline, and clinical specialty.
The analysis of the attributes of modern physical therapy has been undertaken with special reference to the definitions of the concepts, categories, classifications, therapeutic physical factors, and physical treatment methods that provide the basis of modern physical therapy.
The directions of scientific and practical development of physiotherapy in the currently adopted system of organization of the medical care services in Russia are determined.
The discussion presents arguments for the introduction of new concepts, terms, classifications, and treatment methods.
The prerequisites for the formation of such notions and ideas, their composition and structure as well as the role of the therapeutic physical factors in the system of treatment and preventive measures are considered.
The basic methodological approaches (both evidence-based and systematic) which are in line with modern physiotherapeutic research programs are substantiated.
Special attention is given in the article to the currently adopted system of the training of physiotherapists accepting present-day ideas and practicing modern approaches in their practical work.
The principal way to carry out this task under the present-day conditions is through education in a three-stage manner in accordance with the main categories of physical therapy.  The current status and assessment of the use of the concepts of evidence-based and translational medicine in physiotherapy are discussed together with the prospects for its further systematic development and practical application.
