[Perioperative use of statins in vascular surgery].
The review is dedicated to studying the effect of perioperative use of statins while performing vascular operations, examining possible aftermaths of statins discontinuation in the perioperative period and discussing safety of perioperative use of statins.  Cardiovascular complications constitute the most common cause of perioperative mortality while performing major noncardiac operations.
Clinical studies demonstrated a favourable effect of statins on the cardiovascular complications rate in the perioperative period, therefore use of statins for prevention of cardiovascular diseases seems substantiated appropriate.
Acting upon the levels of blood serum lipids, statins also influence various signal cellular pathways, exerting anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and vasodilating effects.
Thus, they may be used not only for patients with lipid metabolism impairments.  However, currently required are further studies in order to determine optimal dosage, as well as the terms and duration of therapy with statins in the perioperative period.
