[Efficacy of different doses of botox in treatment of chronic migraine].
AIM  To compare the efficacy of botox used in doses of 155 U and 195 U for preventive treatment of chronic migraine (CM).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-nine women with CM were stratified into two groups according to the dose of botox.
The duration of the study was 9 month, patient's state was assessed before treatment and after repeated injections (every 3 month).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
With regard to the frequency of migraine attacks, the 1st and 2nd injections of botox were equally effective.  After the 3rd injection, the frequency was significantly lower in group 2 (195 U).
After 2nd and 3rd injections, an effect on patient's adaptation assessed with the MIDAS and patient's satisfaction with treatment were higher.
The results suggest the dose-dependent efficacy of repeated injections of botox.  The dose of 195 U can be recommended in preventive treatment of CM as more effective.
