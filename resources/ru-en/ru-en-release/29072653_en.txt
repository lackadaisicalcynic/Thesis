[Peculiarities of the early diagnostics of malignant nasopharyngal neoplasms].  The authors consider the risk factors and the specific clinical symptoms of the malignant nasopharyngal neoplasms as well as the methods for instrumental, laboratory, and pathomorphological diagnostics of this pathology.
The full scale implementation of the recommendations for the timely detection of the tumours using the aforementioned diagnostic procedures and tests makes it possible to reduce to a minimum the interval between the establishment of the diagnosis and the onset of the relevant treatment at the early stages of the disease and thereby to ensure the improvement of its long-term outcomes.
