[Characteristic vitreous changes in congenital cataracts].
AIM
To analyze changes and identify specific signs of underdevelopment of the vitreous body in certain types of congenital cataracts.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 26 patients (52 eyes) with congenital changes in the lens and vitreous were examined by means of digital spatial ultrasound imaging.
RESULTS
On the basis of multiplanar ultrasound examination and three-dimensional virtual modelling of the eye, spatial ultrasonographic characteristics of combined congenital involvement of the lens and vitreous have been determined.
The changes revealed are shown to be morphologically related.
CONCLUSION
The results suggest three-dimensional digital ultrasound virtual modelling useful for studying combined congenital changes in the lens and vitreous and, thereby, it enables 'decoding' of some elements of their normal morphology.
