[A new approach in the compression therapy of postoperative scars].  The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of compression therapy with a prolonged plaster of Contractubex in the formation of skin scarring in children after surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In a prospective open-label randomized trial, 109 patients aged 5.3±2.1 years after surgery: boys - 73, girls - 36.
Patients were divided into 2 groups: in the main group (54 children) the application of the prolonged plaster Contractubex was performed; in the control group (55 patients) - dynamic observation.
The scar deformation was assessed according to the Vancouver scale for 10, 30 and 90 postoperative days.
RESULTS
94.4% patients had good compliance; in 2 (3.7%) - satisfactory; in 1 (1.9%) - unsatisfactory compliance.  In our study, the formation of hypertrophic scars in the main group was significantly less frequent than in the control group (1 and 8 patients, respectively, χ2=4.241, p=0.042).
CONCLUSION  Thus, the use of the prolonged plaster Contractubex in the near and distant period a good cosmetic and functional result in the formation of a postoperative scar was provided.
