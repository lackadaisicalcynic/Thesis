AIM  Comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of various hemostatic methods in patients with colon and rectal cancer complicated by bleeding.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 77 hospitalized patients with colon and rectal cancer complicated by bleeding.
Conservative therapy was effective in 11 patients (group I), endoscopic hemostasis in 49 cases (group II), 17 patients underwent emergency surgery (bowel resection/ internal iliac arteries ligation) (group III). Vascular embolization was performed in 2 patients.
20 out of 77 patients in groups I-II underwent elective surgery and radiochemotherapy in 7-10 days after hemorrhage and normalization of hemoglobin.
3-year Kaplan-Meier survival was assessed after emergency (group III) and elective (I-II) interventions in 37 survivors.
RESULTS
The effectiveness of various methods of hemostasis was 14.3% in group I, 80.3% in group II and 100% in group III. Embolization was ineffective (patients underwent surgery).
Complications were observed in 4.9% (II) and 29.4% (III), respectively.
Mortality was significantly higher after conditionally radical surgery than after endoscopy: 17.6% vs. 0.
3-year survival was better after elective interventions compared with emergency surgery (0.79 vs. 0.64, respectively).
CONCLUSION
Endoscopy is the most effective method to stop colonic bleeding with minimal complications.  It is a 'bridge to surgery' and alternative to conditionally radical operations in order to reduce mortality.
Treatment of bleeding should be carried out in multi-field hospital by highly qualified specialists.
