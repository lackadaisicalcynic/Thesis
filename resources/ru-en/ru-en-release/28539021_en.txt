[Age-related changes of hemodynamic potential of the nasal cavity of a human].  Vascular system of the nasal cavity has a complex structural organization and a wide range of functionality.
However, with age, the hemodynamics of the nasal cavity undergoes specific changes, detection of which is of practical importance for gerontology and medicine.
This paper presents the results of the study of hemodynamics of the nasal cavity in Mature, elderly and senile age by the method of rheorinography .
Identified critical periods of functional changes of blood flow of the nasal cavity: the elderly (exit definitivno state) and old age (involution hemodynamic function and the reduction of its compensatory capacity).
