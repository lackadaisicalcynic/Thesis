Evidence for national universal eye health plans.
Many low- and middle-income countries use national eye-care plans to guide efforts to strengthen eye-care services.  The World Health Organization recognizes that evidence is essential to inform these plans.
We assessed how evidence was incorporated in a sample of 28 national eye-care plans generated since the Universal eye health: a global action plan 2014-2019 was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2013.
Most countries (26, 93%) cited estimates of the prevalence of blindness and 18 countries (64%) had set targets for the cataract surgical rate in their plan.
Other evidence was rarely cited or used to set measurable targets.
No country cited evidence from systematic reviews or solution-based research.  This limited use of evidence reflects its low availability, but also highlights incomplete use of existing evidence.
For example, despite sex-disaggregated data and cataract surgical coverage being available from surveys in 20 countries (71%), these data were reported in the eye health plans of only nine countries (32%).  Only three countries established sex-disaggregated indicators and only one country had set a target for cataract surgical coverage for future monitoring.
Countries almost universally recognized the need to strengthen health information systems and almost one-third planned to undertake operational or intervention research.
Realistic strategies need to be identified and supported to translate these intentions into action.  To gain insights into how a country can strengthen its evidence-informed approach to eye-care planning, we reflect on the process underway to develop Kenya's seventh national plan (2019-2023).
