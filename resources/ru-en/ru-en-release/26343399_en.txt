[Adhesion as criterion of choice of materials for dental restorations of defects in cervical area].  The paper presents the results of comparative in vitro evaluation of classical and flow consistency restorative polymeric materials (Japan and Russia) adhesion to dentin in cervical area.
The adhesive properties of these materials were compared with the experimental systems of "sandwich" type, combining layers of classic and flow consistency, glass-ionomer cement Fuji 8 (Japan) and material SMARTCEM 2 (Switzerland).
The highest dentin adhesion strength showed Fuji 8, restoration materials of classical consistency proved to have advantage in adhesion properties.
