[The metabolic memory phenomenon in predicting a risk for vascular complications in diabetes mellitus].  The paper presents data on positive and negative metabolic memory phenomena in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) as exemplified by the long-term randomized trials DCCT, UKPDS, ACCORD, VADT, and ADVANCE.
It discusses the role of metabolic memory in predicting a risk for vascular complications in DM.
Ideas on the mechanisms of this phenomenon, which are based on the activation of oxidative stress, the production of irreversible glycation products, and epigenetic disorders, are given.
