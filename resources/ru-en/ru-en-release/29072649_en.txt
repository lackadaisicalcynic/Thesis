[Algorithm of orthodontic treatment of cleft lip and palate patients before and after autogenous bone grafting].
The aim of the study was to elaborate the algorithm of orthodontic treatment of cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients.
One hundred and twenty-six CLP patients after CLP plasty preparing for alveolar ridge reconstruction were divided into 3 groups according to their age: 47 (37%) patients aged 6 to 11 years; 50 (40%) aged 12 to 17 years; 29 (23%) patients aged 18-27.
Eighty-four (66.7%) patients had unilateral CLP and 42 (33.3%) had bilateral CLP.
Complex examination revealed typical dental and maxillofacial features for each group.
Clinical and diagnostic imaging data allowed formulating rationale for complex treatment approach and algorithm of treatment option choice according to patients age at the time of alveolar ridge reconstruction.
