[Perspectives of intravascular ultrasound during the myocardial revascularization of elderly and senile patients].  Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) of coronary arteries has lately been extensively used in the routine work of catheter laboratories.
This method`s availability for qualifying the structure of atherosclerosis plague, degree of stricture formation in artery opening, length of the plaque while choosing the relevant size of stent and also for stent apposition control after implantation, makes IVUS an irreplaceable help in endovascular surgeons` work.  Combination of coronary angiography and IVUS best represents the plaqued segments of artery total picture.
Morpho-functional characteristics of coronary arteries of elderly or senile patients and also frequent multivessel diseases, strongly marked calcification and severe comorbidity make IVUS especially current for myocardial revascularization of this group of patients.
