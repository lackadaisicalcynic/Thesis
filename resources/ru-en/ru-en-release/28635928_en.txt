[Changes in hemostasis-related parameters of blood and lacrimal fluid in patients with retinal vein occlusion].  High prevalence of retinal vein occlusion in young people as well as treatment complexity and inadequate control of hemostatic parameters of blood and lacrimal fluid determine the significance of relevant research in patients with retinal vascular pathology.  The data thus obtained may be useful for disease prognosis, severity evaluation and therapy control.
This review is aimed to study hemostasis-related parameters of blood and lacrimal fluid in such patients.
