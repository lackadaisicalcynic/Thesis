[The patulous Eustachian tube syndrome: the current state-of-the-art and an original clinical observation.  Second communication].
The choice of the treatment strategy for the patients presenting with the patulous Eustachian tube syndrome constitutes a serious challenge for an otorhinolaryngologist.
Despite the considerable progress achieved during the past years in the development of modern pharmacotherapy and functional endoscopic surgery, the specialists often encounter difficulties in the management of the patients suffering from this disease.
The present article (continuing the previous communication) contains information concerning the historical and modern approaches to the treatment of the patients with the patulous Eustachian tube syndrome.  The authors describe the conservative and surgical methods employed for the treatment of this condition and the approaches to the choice of the treatment strategies depending on the etiology, pathogenesis, and severity of the disorder being considered, its duration, and the character of the morphological changes identified during the diagnostic procedures.
The authors emphasize the importance of the wait-and-see strategy for the treatment of the patients presenting with the patulous Eustachian tube syndrome.
In conclusion, they present the concrete results of four original observations of such patients.
