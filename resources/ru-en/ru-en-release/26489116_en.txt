[Distortion of vitreous structure in eyes with lens dislocation].
AIM
to study the range of structural changes in the vitreous and to determine spatial position of the lens in case of its dislocation.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 47 patients (94 eyes) with so-called senile cataract aged from 59 to 83 years were examined.  The state of the vitreous was evaluated by means of digital ultrasound examination.
RESULTS
Combined structural changes in the basis and cortex of the vitreous in eyes with lens and/or its elements dislocation have been analyzed.
The possibility of lens evaluation in terms of its integrity and topography as well as spatial position of its elements has been shown.  The relationship between the vitreous and lens changes has also been established.
CONCLUSION  Digital ultrasound examination is capable of producing a 3D image of the eye, thus, allowing to assess spatial defects of the vitreous and to determine the position of the lens in case of its dislocation.
