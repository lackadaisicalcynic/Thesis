There were 85 cases of endovascular treatment of acute myocardial infarct (AMI) in patients older than 75 years old in our investigation.  The age of patients was from 75 to 96 years, the average age - 82,6±1,3 years.
As for gender, all patients were divided into 2 groups: men - 37
(43,5 %) and female - 48
(56,5 %). The study was conducted in the following areas: determination of the baseline status of patients, analysis of technical aspects of diagnostic and medical percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), as well as the comparison of results.  RESULTS
apart from gender identities, the following results were obtained (p>0,05): high prevalence of cardiac diseases and basic somatic diseases; the acute cardiac failure (pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock) was registered in 25,8 % of cases; the proportion of patients who were admitted 6 hours later from the onset of disease and who have had delayed reperfusion therapy, was 37,5 %; significant improvement of coronary blood flow in infarct-related coronary artery (TIMI classification), from an average index 1,4±0,2 before coronary stenting to 2,7±0,1 after interventions; endovascular operations were conducted in patients with multiple pathology of coronary arteries in the setting of extended occlusive lesions of infarct-related coronary artery; high efficiency of application of aspiration catheters for the removal of thrombotic masses in acute occlusion, as well as special devices for closing a puncture hole in the femoral arteries.
Reduction of mortality in AMI patients over 75 years old of both sexes is associated with an increase in the proportion of emergency PCI.
In both gender groups endovascular intervention was characterized by a clinically significant restoration of coronary circulation.
Specific complications of PCI are rare, and it proves the safety of reperfusion therapy in the studied age group.
