[Sequence of stages of hybrid operations in patients with Leriche syndrome and critical limb ischaemia].  Presented in the article are the results of treating a total of 108 patients with chronic critical lower limb ischaemia (CCLLI) confirmed according to the recommendations of the Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) 2007 [1].
All patients were diagnosed as having combined lesions of the aortoiliac and femoropopliteal segments of the arterial bed of the lower limbs.
All patients underwent simultaneous hybrid operations: open reconstructive interventions in the infrarenal zone and stenting of iliac arteries.
In the comparison group (n=14) the first stage consisted of restoration of the inflow pathways followed by open reconstruction of the femoropopliteal segment.
In the Study Group (n=94) the first stage was infrainguinal reconstruction by the open technique followed by stenting of the arteries of the aortoiliac segment.
It was shown that restoration the outflow pathways as the first stage was associated with a considerable decrease in the risk of intraoperative complications.
