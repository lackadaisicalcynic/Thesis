[Results of video-assisted technologies in colorectal surgery].
AIM
To analyze immediate outcomes of 286 laparoscopic and robot-assisted interventions on the colon and rectum.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 256 (89.51%) laparoscopic and 30 (10.49%) robot-assisted procedures. 233 (81.46%) operations were performed for rectum and colon cancer.
Postoperative complications after colon cancer surgery were revealed in 11.11%, including anastomosis failure in 2.08% of cases.
Postoperative complications after rectal cancer surgery occurred in 32.58% of cases including anastomosis failure after anterior rectectomy in 11.67%.
CONCLUSION
Robot-assisted surgery is not advisable for colon diseases according to price-effectiveness ratio due to available laparoscopic approach.  Preventive intestinal stoma in endoscopic low and ultra-low anterior rectal resection allows you to avoid clinically significant inconsistency of colorectal anastomosis.
Laparoscopic procedure should be performed with Contour stitching-cutting device in low and ultra-low anterior rectal resection if there is technical complexity of one-stage rectum intersection below the tumor.
Robot-assisted operations for rectal cancer have advantages due to three-dimensional imaging and better orientation, greater freedom of manipulation in confined spaces, and simplicity of lymphadenectomy.
