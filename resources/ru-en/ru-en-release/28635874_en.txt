[Subclavian steal syndrome].  Literature data on the etiology, clinical picture, diagnostic variants and treatment of subclavian steal syndrome are reviewed.
Different clinical variants and neurological symptoms of the syndrome are described.
Multispiral computed tomography, along with ultrasound examination, is important in the diagnosis of the syndrome and its causes.
The use of other methods is necessary for more accurate diagnosis and prevention of perioperative complications.
The character of damage of subclavian arteries and brachiocephalic stem should be taken into account in the choice of an optimal method of surgical treatment.
