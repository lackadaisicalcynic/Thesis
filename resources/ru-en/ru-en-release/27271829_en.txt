[The state of receptor-dependent signal pathways in the agranulocytes from the peripheral blood of the reconvalescent patients following community-acquired pneumonia under the influence of microwave radiation].  The present article reports the study of the influence of low-intensity microwave radiation on the state of the JAK/STAT-signaling pathways in the mononuclear cells and the intercellular levels of the molecules maintaining the functioning of this pathway.
The experiments on the model of intercellular interactions in the whole blood cell culture obtained during the convalescence phase of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia were designed to elucidate the effects of the cell-cell interactions in the culture exposed to electromagnetic radiation with a frequency of 1000 MHz and power flux density 0.1 mcW/cm2 on the intracellular levels of total and phosphorylated species of JAK-kinases, STAT-factors and SOCS-proteins.  It is concluded that sensitivity of intracellular signaling systems to the effects of low-intensity microwave radiation manifests itself in the form of increased intracellular concentrations of Janus kinases and SOCS proteins with a simultaneous decrease in the level of STAT factors.
