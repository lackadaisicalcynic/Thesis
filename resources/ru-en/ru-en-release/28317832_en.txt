[Variations of oral fluid microbiota in healthy children and adolescents].  The aim of the study was to establish the bacterial and viral associations of saliva and the immune resistance in 127 healthy people of different ages.
The analysis sorted out three variants of oral fluid microbiota differing by certain combination of indigenous and facultative microflora.
It was found that with age there is a significant increase in the number of adolescents with the third variant of the microbiota, characterized by a decrease in the number of indigenous microflora and increase in opportunistic microorganisms and viruses.
With an increase in microecological shifts a tendency to decrease the level of lysozyme, an increase in the number of secretory IgA, accompanied by a decrease in antibody was revealed.
It has been shown that bacterial and viral component of the microbiota of the oral fluid are in a dynamic relationship with each other, as well as immune resistance and can serve as an indicator of the health level and the selection criteria at the stages of clinical examination of children and adolescents, with the risk of dental disease.
