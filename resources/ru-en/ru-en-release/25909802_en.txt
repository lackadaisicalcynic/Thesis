[Impairments of social cognition and depressions].  Directions in the studies of social cognition in depression are presented.
Social cognition should be studied basing on the experience and content of the key psychotherapeutic approaches to depression treatment as well as on the studies of cognitive and motivational characteristics of patients with depression.
The authors suggest the directions for further development of the problem: the relationship between impairment of social intelligence and general deficit in abilities to self-regulation of thinking; studies of a role of motivation and social anhedonia in the structure of social cognition impairment.
