[Secondary closed rhinoplasty in the patient presenting with post-injurious deformation of the external nose].  The authors describe the process of the surgical treatment of a patient presenting with the displaced fracture of the nasal bones involving the left orbital wall.
The correction was performed by means of secondary closed rhinoseptoplastic surgery.  The special emphasis is laid on the importance of computer-assisted modeling for the planning and achievement of the favourable surgical outcome.
