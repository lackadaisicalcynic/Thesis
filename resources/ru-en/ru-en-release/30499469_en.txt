[The role of the combinatorial analysis in forensic medical dermatoglyphics: the possibilities and variants of its application in research and expert studies].
This article is focused on the possibilities provided by the combinatorial analysis for the solution of a variety of diagnostic problems encountered in forensic medical dermatoglyphics.  The main principles underlying combinatorially-designed characteristic of the dermatoglyphic features are described in the application to the results of mathematical statistical analysis and the expert evaluation of the specific quantitative characteristics of the papillary patterns.
The objective data are presented that give evidence of a higher sensitivity of the combinatorial analysis in comparison with the traditional analytical methods used in dermatoglyphic investigations.
