[Life quality of patients with benign tumors of the anterior and middle part of the skull base after surgery and during follow-up].  The results of surgical and combination therapy of 302 patients with benign tumors of the anterior and middle regions of the skull base with allowance for the functional outcomes (immediately after surgery and during the catamnestic follow-up) are reported.
The Karnofsky and Rankin scales and the Anterior Skull Base Questionnaire (ASBQ) were used for the analysis.  Radical tumor resection, as compared to partial resection, reduces the quality of life in the early postoperative period but increases it in future; the use of radiation therapy in combination treatment for patients with radically inoperable tumors does not worsen their quality of life in the late postoperative period.
