[Neurotrophic effects of lithium stimulate the reduction of ischemic and neurodegenerative brain damage].  For over 60 years, high doses of lithium (hundreds of milligrams of elemental lithium) have being used to treat bipolar disorder.
However, only during the past 20 years the relevant basic and clinical studies have shown that neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects of lithium are possible in much smaller doses ( hundreds of micrograms of elemental lithium).  These data indicate a significant potential for the clinical applications of lithium-based drugs in modern neurology for the purposes of prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative and ischemic pathologies.
Pharmacological and molecular biology studies indicated that the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-syntentase-3 (GSK-3) and induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factors are the main mechanisms of neurotropic actions of lithium.
Also, by inhibiting the NMDA receptors, lithium regulates the calcium homeostasis and inhibits the activation of calcium-dependent apotosis.
These and other molecular mechanisms of lithium action protect neurons from ischemia and neurodegeneration thus contributing to a significant reduction of neurological deficit in various models of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.
