[Ischemic stroke in the patients with comorbid pathology].
AIM  To study an effect of comorbidity on the course and outcome of ischemic stroke (IS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Results of a unicenter, retrospective, cohort study of 190 patients with ischemic stroke (IS) were analyzed.
Severity of stroke, dependence in the daily activities, comorbidity were assessed using NIHSS, the Rankin scale,CCI, CIRS.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The correlation of IS severity and outcome with the severity of comorbid pathology assessed by CCI and CIRS was identified.
Severity of comorbid pathology increased with the age of patients.
Comorbidity (CCI) and stroke severity (NIHSS) were predictors of IS outcome (the Rankin scale) (R=0.72210324; R2=0.52143308; p=0.0026). The effect of comorbidity on survivability of stroke was shown.
The results can be useful for the management of the patient with acute IS in a specialized inpatient setting.
