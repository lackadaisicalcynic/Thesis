[Long-term results of different approaches to revascularization in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome and multiple coronary atherosclerosis].  AIM
To assess the long-term results of different approaches to treating patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS) and multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD).  SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A total of 150 patients with NSTE ACS, in whom coronary angiography revealed MVCAD, were examined.  The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the selected treatment policy: 1) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (n=91 (60.6%)); 2) coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n=40 (26.6%)); and 3) only medical treatment (n=9 (6%)).
The mean follow-up was 27.6Â±3.5 months.
RESULTS
The medical treatment policy in this patient sample demonstrates the worst results, with the majority of cardiovascular events developing in the hospital period.  PCI in patients with NSTE ACS and multiple coronary atherosclerosis has a number of objective limitations in this patient sample, leading to suboptimal treatment outcome.
CONCLUSION  The use of CABG or PCI as a myocardial revascularization technique in patients with NSTE ACS and MVCAD is characterized by a comparable satisfactory survival in the hospital and long-term follow-up periods.
12% of patients do not receive revascularization due to the extremely high risk from any of coronary blood restoring methods, which results in very many deaths largely occurring during the hospital period.
