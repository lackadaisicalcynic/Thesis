[Morphometric features of the structure of the central nucleus of the amygdala in men and women].
OBJECTIVE
To identify the interhemispheric asymmetry in the structure of the central nucleus of the amygdala in men and women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Morphometric features of the structure of neurons of the central nucleus amygdala complex were studied in histological sections of the brain of 6 men and 6 women (24 hemispheres), aged 19 to 55 years, with no lifetime diagnosis of mental or neurological disease.  The value of the profile fields of neurons of the central nucleus amygdala complex in the left and right hemispheres of the brain were investigated.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  In women, the average value of neurons in the left hemisphere was somewhat greater than in the right hemisphere, while in men this value was greater in the right hemisphere.
The interhemispheric morphometric differences were not significant regardless of gender.  In addition, the quantity of relevant fields of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala in women was significantly larger than that of men in both hemispheres.
The authors attempted to associate the results obtained in the study with emotional perception in men and women.
