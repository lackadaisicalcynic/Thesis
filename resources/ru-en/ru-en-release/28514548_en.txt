[The effect of vascular peptide bioregulator on the microcirculation in the brain cortex of old rats].  Using a TV device to study brain microcirculation, we found that after a course of vascular peptide bioregulator the density of microvascular network of pia matter of old rats (22-24 months) sensomotor cortex increased about 2,5-2,8 times compared to control old rates; and noradrenaline-induced constriction reactions and acetylcholine-induced dilative reactions of the pial arterioles increased significantly.
This perfusion in the tissue of the cerebral cortex is not increased, but the degree of blood oxygen saturation in the microvasculature of this tissue region raised.
