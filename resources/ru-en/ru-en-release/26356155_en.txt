[The anxiety-depressive spectrum disorders in patients with larynx diseases].
AIM  To perform a psychopathological and clinical/psychological analysis of anxiety-depressive spectrum disorders (ADSD) in inflammatory otorhinolaryngological disease - larynx granuloma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 30 patients, aged 33-65 years, including 13 patients with post-surgical recurrence of granuloma and 17 patients diagnosed for the first time with granuloma.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The relationship between larynx granuloma and ADSD, predominantly of chronic type was shown.
Prolonged psychotraumatic factors play a significant role in the development of ADSD.
A role of anxiety in the ADSD structure as well as an importance of their diagnosis for a choice of therapeutic tactics was confirmed.
Psychopharmacotherapy has led to a reduction in the frequency of granuloma relapses.
The results confirmed the productivity of affective-stress model, based on the type of affectivity, in the analysis of ADSD.
