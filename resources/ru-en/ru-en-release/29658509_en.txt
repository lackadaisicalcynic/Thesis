[Experimental approaches to the investigation of behavioral disorders associated with prenatal alcohol exposure].
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is an umbrella term which covers a wide range of deficits in prenatal and postnatal growth, anatomy and CNS functions produced by prenatal alcohol exposure.
The most severe form of FASD is fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) characterized by additional specific craniofacial and brain malformations.  Despite a high prevalence and extensive clinical studies, the fundamental mechanisms of FASD are still poorly understood.
Thereby, experimental models, which allow better control for both socio-environmental and genetic factors, are critical to our understanding of FASD.
The review is focused on the effects of exposure to alcohol during the prenatal period in animal models.  The authors outline that prenatally alcohol-induced changes in motor and executive functions, learning and memory, stress reactivity and affective state are remarkably parallel between animals and humans.
Finally, the authors consider a potential impact of postnatal social and environmental factors on the outcome in experimental models of FASD.
