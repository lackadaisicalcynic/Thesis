[Laparoscopic-assisted harvesting of omental flap in chest wall reconstruction for deep sternal wound infection].  AIM
To present an experience of laparoscopic-assisted harvesting of omental flap in chest wall reconstruction for deep sternal wound infection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was made a prospective analysis of 14 patients aged 39-85 years after laparoscopic-assisted harvesting of omental flap in chest wall reconstruction for the period December 2014 - November 2016.
Men/women ratio was 10/4.
All patients had deep sternal wound infection grade IV (Oakley-Wright classification).
RESULTS
Postoperative complications were observed in 2 (14.3%) of 14 (95% CI: 4.0-39.9%) cases that did not require re-operation.
There were no 30-day postoperative mortality and significant complications as acute intestinal obstruction, postoperative ventral herniation and transplant rejection.
Mean postoperative hospital-stay was 10.5 (9; 13) days.
CONCLUSION
Laparoscopic-assisted harvesting of omental flap is safe method for chest wall reconstruction in patients with severe sternal wound infection associated with soft tissue deficiency and high risk of local complications (bleeding, etc.).
Laparoscopy significantly reduces incidence of postoperative complications after omental flap transposition and is feasible in majority of patients.
