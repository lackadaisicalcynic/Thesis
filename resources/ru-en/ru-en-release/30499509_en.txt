[Non-drug methods in the treatment of resistant mental pathology (a neurophysiological approach)].  The author considers the drug resistance in therapy of mental diseases of the brain within the neurophysiological concept of N.P. Behtereva about stable pathological state.
Interneuronal interaction mechanisms in neuronal networks have the same type in pathological conditions and physiological activity of the brain.
Methods of overcoming the sustainable functional state are aimed at the destruction of formed interneuronal networks and subsequent restructuring interneuronal interactions de novo.  Search for endogenous biochemical markers of pathology under the condition of functional stability of interneuronal interactions can not be considered as a perspective direction for the detection of a pathognomonic sign of a specific brain pathology.
The author argues that all known methods of non-drug exposure used today (magnetic and electrical stimulation, neurotransplantants, deafferentation, etc.) and methods with historical significance (comatose therapy, pyrotherapy) have a similar effect aimed at the destruction of pathological interneuronal interactions.
