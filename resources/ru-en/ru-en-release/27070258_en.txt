PURPOSE  The article analyzes results of surgical revascularization in patients with symptoms of chronic cerebral ischemia caused by occlusion of the carotid arteries.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We analyzed 404 surgeries for placement of extra-intracranial microvascular anastomoses (EICMAs) performed in 376 patients between 2000 and 2015.
All patients underwent detailed neurological and neuropsychological examinations before surgery and throughout the follow-up period using the neurological deficit scale (NIHSS).
Additionally, the medical history data, technical features of surgery, and results of instrumental tests were recorded.
For a more detailed study of the cerebral circulation, a SCT perfusion examination was conducted in 58 patients before and after placement of EICMA.
RESULTS
All patients were divided into 3 groups, depending on the surgical treatment outcomes: improvement (53%), without significant changes (43%), and worsening of clinical symptoms (4%).
A statistical analysis revealed that the efficacy of EICMA surgery ranged from 22 to 79% and was reliably confirmed by hemodynamic and anamnestic factors as well as by technical details of surgery.
CONCLUSION
When determining the indications for surgical revascularization in patients with ischemic stroke consequences, the patient's age, occlusion duration, location and size of ischemic lesions should be considered.
Also, the choice of the acceptor artery and blood flow through the created anastomosis are of great importance.
