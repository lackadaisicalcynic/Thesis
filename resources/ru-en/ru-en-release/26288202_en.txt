[The new technologies for the intraoperative registration of the electrically evoked compound action potentials of the acoustical nerve by means of the neural response telemetry method].  The present article reports the results of a clinical study of the new wireless device CR120 designed for the intraoperative registration of electrode resistance and the electrically evoked compound action potential (EAP) of the acoustical nerve by means of neural response telemetry.
The study has demonstrated the high effectiveness of the application of the new wireless device in clinical practice.
It was shown that the registration of electrically evoked compound action potential with the help of the CR120 Intraoperative Remote Assistant took 22% less time than by the conventional method (p<0.001).  Moreover, the trial revealed the strong correlation between the threshold EAP values recorded with the use of the new device and by the classical method.
