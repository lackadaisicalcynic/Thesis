[Antimicrobial anti-inflammatory photodynamic and light-emitting-diode phototherapy of the consequences of the gunshot and mine-blast injury to the face, head, and neck including damage to the ENT organs].  The objective of the present study was the enhancement of the effectiveness of the treatment of the consequences of the gunshot wounds and mine-blast injuries inflicted to the face, head, and neck encountered in the otolaryngological practice as well as the prevention of the formation of the large demarcation areas in the injured tissues and the preparation of these tissues for the further restorative treatment.
Anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory photodynamic therapy (PDT) as well as light-emitting-diode (LED) phototherapy were carried out in 20 patients who suffered gunshot wounds and mine-blast injuries to the face, head, and neck.
The photodynamic therapy was performed with the use of an aqueous solution of methylene blue at a concentration of 0.1%, the 'Alod-1' infrared laser ('Granat' modification, Russia), and the 'AFS-Solaris' light-emitting diode-based phototherapeutic apparatus (Russia).
The analysis of the results of the study has demonstrated the high efficiency of the proposed approach that made it possible to prevent the development of severe septic complications, reduce the amount of drug therapy, significantly shorten duration of the treatment, and create the conditions for the earlier rehabilitation and further plastic and cosmetic restoration of the tissue structures.
