[Dopamine neurotransmission of peripheral blood lymphocytes is a potential biomarker of psychiatric and neurological disorders].  Current literature on a role of dopamine in the development of mental and neurological disorders suggests that the discovery of endogenous dopamine in peripheral blood lymphocytes gave rise to a new line of research.
Dopamine receptors are not only found on cells of the innate immune response (nonspecific), but also on cells of adaptive immune response (specific): T and B lymphocytes.
These facts bring a new evidence of interrelationships between the peripheral immune system, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and suggest new ways for investigation of the pathogenesis of different mental and neurological disorders, in particular Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
There is strong evidence that ligands of dopamine receptors can change the expression of coding genes both in central neurons and in peripheral cells.  Thus, peripheral blood lymphocytes may prove a cellular tool to identify dopamine transmission disturbances in neuropsychiatric diseases, as well as to monitor the effects of pharmacological treatment.
