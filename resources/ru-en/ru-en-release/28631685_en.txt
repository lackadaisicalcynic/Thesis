[The transperygoid approach to the removal of a recurrent juvenile angiofibroma at the base of the skull without preoperative embolization].  The authors report a clinical case of successful elimination of a recurrent juvenile angiofibroma at the base of the skull (JAFBS) with the application of the optical navigation system and a cold plasma scalpel in the absence of preoperative embolization.
It has been demonstrated using the proposed transperygoid approach to the extirpation of the tumour that a recurrent juvenile angiofibroma at the base of the skull can be efficiently removed by means of a modern minimally invasive and at the same time radical surgical method.
