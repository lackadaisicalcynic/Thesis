[Brain function recovery after prolonged posttraumatic coma].  OBJECTIVE
To explore the characteristics of brain function recovery in patients after prolonged posttraumatic coma and with long-unconscious states.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty-seven patients after prolonged posttraumatic coma were followed-up for two years.  An analysis of a clinical/neurological picture after a prolonged episode of coma was based on the dynamics of vital functions, neurological status and patient's reactions to external stimuli.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Based on the dynamics of the clinical/neurological picture that shows the recovery of functions of the certain brain areas, three stages of brain function recovery after a prolonged episode of coma were singled out: brain stem areas, diencephalic areas and telencephalic areas.
These functional/anatomic areas of brain function recovery after prolonged coma were compared to the present classifications.
