[Balance of hemostasis and anticoagulation therapy techniques for hip arthroplasty].
UNLABELLED  Studied a rational balance of prevention and control of blood loss and antithrombotic therapy in hip arthroplasty.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In view of literature data about significant blood loss during and after the intervention, as well as the formation of the group of patients who refuse blood transfusions for social (including religious) reasons, taken innovative methods for reducing blood loss and needs for blood transfusions.
RESULTS
Complex of techniques, including conducting spinal anesthesia, controlled hypotension with nitroglycerin and pentamine, intraoperative use of systemic hemostatic and preventive use of erythropoietic stimulating agents, was formed in our proprietary technology to reduce blood loss.  Its use has allowed to reach a statistically significant reduction of blood loss and transfusion rate in hip arthroplasty patients.
