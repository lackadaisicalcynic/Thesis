Clinical management of children with fever: a cross-sectional study of quality of care in rural Zambia.
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate current practices and standards of evaluation and treatment of childhood febrile illness in Southern Province, Zambia.  METHODS
From November to December 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of facilities and health workers and we observed the health workers' interactions with febrile children and their caregivers.  The facility survey recorded level of staffing, health services provided by the facility, availability and adequacy of medical equipment, availability of basic drugs and supplies and availability of treatment charts and guidelines.
The health worker survey assessed respondents' training, length of service, access to national guidelines and job aids for managing illnesses, and their practice and knowledge on management of neonatal and child illnesses.
We also conducted exit interviews with caregivers to collect information on demographic characteristics, chief complaints, counselling and drug dispensing practices.  FINDINGS
This study included 24 health facilities, 53 health workers and 161 children presenting with fever.  Facilities were insufficiently staffed, stocked and equipped to adequately manage childhood fever.
Children most commonly presented with upper respiratory tract infections (46%; 69), diarrhoea (31%; 27) and malaria (10%; 16).
Health workers insufficiently evaluated children for danger signs, and less than half (47%; 9/19) of children with pneumonia received appropriate antibiotic treatment.  Only 57% (92/161) were tested for malaria using either rapid diagnostic tests or microscopy.
CONCLUSION  Various health system challenges resulted in a substantial proportion of children receiving insufficient management and treatment of febrile illness.
Interventions are needed including strengthening the availability of commodities and improving diagnosis and treatment of febrile illness.
