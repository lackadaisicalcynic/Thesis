[Differential diagnostics of headache associated with pathological changes in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses].
Headache is not infrequently one of the major complaints in the patients visiting the otorhinolaryngologist's office.
It was estimated to occur in 24% of the patients presenting with chronic sinusitis.  The cause of headache may be pathological processes either in the nasal cavity or in the paranasal sinuses as well as a primary disorder in the nervous system.
The present article is concerned with the peculiar features of rhinogenic headache and that of a different etiology.
It was shown that the patients suffering from headache are in need not only of the obligatory otorhinolaryngological examination including endoscopy of the nasal cavity, X-ray study and, sometimes, specialized tests but also of neurological counseling.  However, the surgical treatment does not always results in the elimination or relief of the rhinogenic headache.
Hence, the importance of the evaluation of the risks and benefits of such treatment for an individual patient.
The formation of the contact points in the nasal mucosa is considered to be one of the possible causes of rhinogenic headache.  However, this opinion needs to be confirmed by the results of large-scale comparative clinical studies.
