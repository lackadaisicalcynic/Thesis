OBJECTIVE  to explore the sensory disturbances in the arm on the side of operation compared to the opposite upper extremity and evaluate quality of life in patients with breast cancer with postmastectomy syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 110 women during one year including 64 (58.2%) with intact intercostal and shoulder nerves (group 1) and 46 (41.8%) with the nerves removed due to the progression of cancer or anatomical characteristics (group 2).  We studied sensory disturbances and assessed quality of life with SF-36 questionnaire.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  In group 1, there were less women with hyperesthesia, and quality of life level was higher compared to group 2.
In group 2, the signs of hyperesthesia were more marked that may be related with the damage and/or compression of these nerves during the axillary lymphadenectomy.  Preservation of intercostal and shoulder nerves during the axillary lymphadenectomy in patients with breast cancer can reduce sensory disturbances and improve quality of life of the patients.
