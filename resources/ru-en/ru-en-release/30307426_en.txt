[Wirsungorrhagia in cystic mucinous pancreasic tumor].  A rare case of virsungorrhagia in a 65 y/o patient with a mucinous tumor of the tail of the pancreas is presented.
Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding was associated with an arrosis of the splenic artery adjacent to the tumor, which required a two-step treatment - endovascular occlusion of the splenic artery and distal resection of the pancreas.
