[The specific morphological features and the mechanisms of formation of the injuries associated with falling down from the high-rise building].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism and the sequence of formation of the extensive injuries associated with falling down from the high-rise building onto the asphalt.
A rare (for the Russian forensic medical practice) observation of falling down from the very high altitude (in excess of 350 m) is described with all the classical features of the damages characteristic of such cases.
Peculiarities of the mechanism of formation of the injuries and the severity of secondary damages in the case being considered were attributable to the huge kinetic energy transferred to the body during falling down from the high aptitude.
