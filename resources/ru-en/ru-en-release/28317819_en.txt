[Correlation of chronic periodontal disease and cardiovascular disease].  The aim of the study was to assess correlative risk of progression of inflammatory periodontal lesions, the development of a systemic inflammatory reaction and cardiovascular diseases.
The study involved 89 patients with chronic periodontal disease (CPD) of varying degrees.  High cardiovascular disease risk was revealed in 8.8% of patients with moderate and 13.3% of patients with severe periodontal disease.
It is proved that an additional factor contributing to the pathogenic relationship between periodontal inflammatory changes and the development of cardiovascular disease is systemic inflammatory response with increased hrC-reactive protein >3.4 mg/l and interleukin-6 to11.0Â±3.4 mg/l.
Changes of blood lipid spectrum with a reduction in apolipoprotein A1 were associated with progression and development of the CPD.  Correlations of somatic and dental pathology requires dentists and cardiologists joint efforts to modify common risk factors.
