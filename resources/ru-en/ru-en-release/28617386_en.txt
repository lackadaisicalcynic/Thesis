[L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria caused by a new mutation in the L2HGDH gene].
The authors present a case-report of 13 year-old girl with L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria [MIM#236792], a rare autosomal/recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the L-encoding 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (L2HGDH, 14q21.3).
Clinical signs of the disease are presented by predominantly neurological symptoms (epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment).
The distinctive feature is the specific multifocal lesion of the white matter detected on MRI.
The characteristic neuroimaging picture and positive results of biochemical and molecular genetic diagnosis were identified.
