[Comparative effectiveness of therapeutic toothpastes with fluoride and hydroxyapatite].  The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of toothpastes containing hydroxyapatite and fluoride on enamel caries resistance and remineralization rate.
Study groups comprised 160 patients divided in 2 groups of 80 patients: 40 - at the age of 15-17 and 40 at the age of 18-25 who have been using toothpastes with hydroxyapatite and fluoride during 1 year.
The plaque determination was carried out with the use of OHI-S and Turesky indexes.
Litmus test pieces were used to determine oral fluid pH.  The clinical determination of enamel remineralization rate, dynamics of acid resistance of enamel were carried out.
Oral hygiene at baseline examination was poor in both groups.
After oral hygiene training, there was a tendency towards indexes decrease more pronounced in the 18-25 age group regardless of the composition of the toothpastes used.
Mean baseline oral fluid pH in the observation group was 6.5±0.4, in the comparison group - 6.8±0.4. By the end of the trial there was a tendency towards the increase of the oral fluid pH, which were 7.3±0.3 and 7.7±0.3, respectively.
The enamel acid resistance of the patients of the observation group was significantly higher (p>0.05) compared with the group of patients using fluoride toothpaste, as well as the proportion of patients in whom the enamel recovery occurred within 24 hours (47.5% vs. 22.5%, respectively).
