[Time course of changes in cytokines (IFN-γ, IFN-α, IL-18, TNF-α) in the treatment of moderate influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (2013-2016) with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and umifenovir (Arbidol) alone and in combination with Kagocel].  AIM
To assess correlation of cytokines levels and therapy regimes a relationship of the time course of changes in the cytokines IFN-γ, IFN-α, IL-18, and TNF-α to the treatment option for influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 with umifenovir (Arbidol) 800 mg/day for 5 days (n=50); oseltamivir (Tamiflu) 150 mg/day for 5 days (n=50); umifenovir (Arbidol) 800 mg/day for 5 days in combination with Kagocel 72 mg/day for 2 days.; 36 mg/day for 2 days (n=50); oseltamivir (Tamiflu) (150 mg/day for 5 days) in combination with Kagocel 72 mg/day for 2 days; 36 mg/day for 2 days (n=50).
A comparison group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The state of immunologic reactivity was assessed twice: at admission of the patients to an infectious disease clinic (at 1-3 disease days) and in the early convalescent period (at 7-8 disease days): venous blood samples were collected to determine the concentrations of IFN-γ, IFN-α, IL-18, and TNF-α by a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay.
RESULTS
All the patients in the acute phase of influenza A showed a statistically significant increase in the levels of IFN-γ, IFN-α, and IL-18 as compared with the control group.
The groups receiving monotherapy in the early convalescent period had a decrease in the IFN-γ, IFN-α, and IL-18 concentrations that could be compensated by the combined use of the immunomodulator Kagocel.
No statistically significant changes in the levels of TNF-α were found in the patients of all the groups, but the groups receiving monotherapy exhibited its lower concentrations in the convalescence period.
CONCLUSION
The combination of etiotropic antiviral drugs with Kagocel enhances the efficiency of antiviral therapy.
Monitoring of antiviral cytokines during the treatment of influenza A is a convenient tool to verify the efficiency of antiviral therapy and needs to be more widely introduced into medical practice.
