[Cardiac involvement in thrombotic microangiopathies].
AIM  To describe cardiac involvement in patients with acute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The case histories of 46 patients with proven TMA, including 17 patients diagnosed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and 29 patients with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS), were analyzed.
RESULTS
Different documentarily verified signs of cardiac involvement were revealed in 6 (13%) patients (5 and 1 patients diagnosed as having aHUS and CAPS, respectively).
Five patients developed myocardial involvement at disease onset in the presence of multiple organ dysfunction.
CONCLUSION
Cases of cardiac involvement in TMA of various genesis are presented.
The exact incidence of myocardial involvement and its prognostic value are unknown so far.
