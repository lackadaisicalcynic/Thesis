[Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of dental caries in individuals with various periodontal status].  The aim of the study was to assess caries intensity and growth rate as well as localization of cavities in patients with periodontal disease as well as individuals with intact periodontium.
Some peculiarities of cavity localization in periodontitis patients are described (proximity to gingival marge, cavities in root cementum, rare vestibular lesions).  Statistically significant difference in caries growth rate was also seen.
