[Twenty years of clinical studies of GJB2-linked hearing loss in Russia].  The most common cause of congenital hereditary hearing loss was discovered 20 years ago in 1997 when GJB2 gene was revealed in the first locus of recessive hearing loss DFNB1.
It encodes protein connexin 26, a structural component of the intercellular channels.  Recessive mutations in this gene cause the congenital bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
For many years the aim of our work was to study the prevalence and clinical manifestations of hereditary hearing loss.
Our research can be divided into three stages.
In the beginning, we investigated the prevalence of GJB2 mutations in a healthy population and in the people suffering from hearing impairment.  Further research was conducted in the field of clinical manifestations and evidence of the congenital character of GJB2-related hearing loss.
Currently, we are working on the prevalence of mild and moderate hereditary hearing loss and the probability of its progression.
Achievements in molecular genetics make it possible to establish the hereditary character of congenital hearing loss and to avoid repeated family cases.  Primary prevention of hereditary hearing loss becomes real by raising the awareness of GJB2 mutations carriers.
