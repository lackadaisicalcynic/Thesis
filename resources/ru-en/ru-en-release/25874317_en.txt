[Lethal intoxication with baclofen].  The objective of the present study was to select and develop simpler methods for the quantitative determination of baclofen in blood with the use of HPLC and tandem MS (MS-MS) techniques and its qualitative determination in cadaveric organs by the GC/MS technique.
These mathods were shown to be suitable for the purpose of forensic medical analysis, clinical, toxicological, and therapeutic monitoring.
The special emphasis is laid on the methods used to investigate the biological materials obtained from the subjects who died from baclofen intoxication.
