[The active neuroprotective therapy of acute carotid ischemic stroke of moderate severity].  Objective.
To evaluate the efficacy of neuroprotective therapy in carotid ischemic stroke.
Material and methods.  An open comparative study of combined neuroprotective therapy in comparison with standard treatment has been carried out in 25 patients with carotid ischemic stroke of moderate severity in the acute period of disease.
Patients received cytoflavin, gliatilin and actovegin, along with basic therapy, during 15 days.
Patient's state was assessed every 5 days using the NIHSS.  The Barthel index was estimated in the 21st day.
Results and conclusion.
By the end of treatment, the degree of neurological deficit was significantly lower in patients treated with the combination of the neuroprotectors.
The better functional rehabilitation to the 21st day and the positive dynamics of inflammation indices and free-radical processes were shown in patients of the main group.
