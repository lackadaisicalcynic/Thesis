[Efficacy of Korteksin in acute period of hemispheric ischemic stroke].  AIM
To study the efficacy and prolonged effect of repeated treatment with low-doses of the neuroprotection drug cortexin (30 mg, (10+10+10, morning, noon, day), daily) in patients in the acute period of hemispheric ischemic stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and twenty-two patients with hemispheric ischemic stroke were studied.
Patients of the first group (n=30) received cortexin in a dose of 20 mg (10+10) intramuscularly along with basic therapy, patients of the second group (n=30) received two courses of cortexin in the same dose for 10 days each with a break of 10 days in-between, patients of the third group (n=30) received only basic therapy, patients of the fourth group (n=32) received cortexin in a dose of 30 mg (10+10+10), two courses for 10 days each with a break of 10 days in-between.
NIHSS, modified Rankin scale, Barthel index, Rivermead mobility index, MMSE, MOCA-test were used to evaluate the severity of the condition.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The most complete regression of neurological deficit during the acute period of ischemic stroke was observed in the fourth group of patients (30 mg (10+10+10) of cortexin, two courses) compared to the 1-3 groups.
