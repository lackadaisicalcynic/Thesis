AIM  To evaluate safety and efficacy of distal pancreatectomy with en bloc celiac artery resection (DP-CAR) for pancreatic malignancy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Medical reports of 17 patients who underwent DP-CAR procedure (15 of them with pancreatic malignancy) were retrospectively analyzed.  Also we studied 27 publications describing more than 2 cases of DP-CAR.
RESULTS
R0- and R1-resection was performed in 14 (82%) and 3 (18%) patients respectively.
Postoperative complications ware observed in 11 (65%) cases.  Nine of them were successfully treated.
Full pain control was achieved in all patients.
There were no any ischemic complications.
16 patients received chemotherapy.
2 (11%) patients died in early postoperative period due to aortic dissection in 10 days and fungal sepsis in 44 days after surgery.
Median survival was 20 months.
Literature review included 27 articles describing 311 operations.  Herewith postoperative complications developed in 43% of cases and 90-day postoperative mortality was 4%.
Median survival ranged from 9.3 to 26 months.
CONCLUSION
DP-CAR is effective and safe procedure in certain patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
