[Pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia].
AIM  To compare the effects of the daytime anxiolytic adaptol and the tranquilizer/nootropic drug noophen on target symptoms related to anxiety spectrum disorders in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty-two patients with CCI and comorbid anxiety spectrum disorders were randomized to adaptol group (n=29) and noophen group (n=33).
Results of treatment were assessed with CGI, MFI-20, HADS-A and HADS-D, MMSE.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Both drugs showed the comparable efficacy and speed of achievement of anxiolytic effect.
Anxiety symptoms were stopped in 79.0% of the patients.
Adaptol was superior to noophen in regard to nonspecific somatic symptoms (Ñ€=0.037).
Asthenia and sleep disorders have decreased significantly in the noophen group.
Use of target symptoms in the individual choice of anxiolytic therapy in patients with anxiety spectrum disorders associated with CCI can increase treatment efficacy.
