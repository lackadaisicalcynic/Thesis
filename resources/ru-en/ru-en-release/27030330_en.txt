[Current characteristics of all-cause and circulatory disease mortality in the Azerbaijan Republic].
AIM  To prove the value of summary data from the State Statistics Commission to characterize of risk of death from circulatory system diseases (CSD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The official data of the State Statistics Commission of the Azerbaijan Republic, which are available at its website (www.stat.gov.az), were analyzed using descriptive statistical procedures to identify qualitative signs.
RESULTS
The population-level CSD death rates in 2011-2013 ranged from 362.7 to 379.60/0000, amounting to 61.1-63.8% of the all-cause mortality in the population.
There were definite differences in male and female deaths due to CSD (377.2-392.0 and 348.4-367.40/0000) and in its proportion among all-cause mortality rates (58.4-60.5 and 64.1-66.4%).
The death rates from CSD in the urban (361.1-380.80/0000) and rural (364.5-378.30/0000) populations and its proportion among all-cause mortality rates in these populations (60.6-62.7 and 61.6-62.8%) were similar.
The male and female working-age population showed essentially dissimilar CSD mortality rates (169.2-179.8 and 51.8-57.10/0000), the men being at greater risk of death (3.14-3.27).
The ratio of all-cause mortality rates in the male and female working-age populations (2.62-2.67) differed from that of CSD-specific ones in these populations (3.14-3.27).
There was a slight difference in CSD-specific mortality rates in the urban and rural working-age populations (116.1-125.0 and 104.9-114.70/0000).
There was also evidence for their similarity in the proportion of CSD among the all-cause mortality rates (43.2-46.2 and 45.0-49.6%).
CONCLUSION
The existing characteristics of mortality in the population (a growth tendency due to CSD) suggest the priority of preventing these diseases.
