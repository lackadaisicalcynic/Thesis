AIM  To analyze informative value of radiological diagnosis of acute gallstone ileus.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 7 patients with acute gallstone ileus who underwent diagnostic abdominal X-ray examination, ultrasonography and computed tomography.
RESULTS
There was high informative value of CT for acute gallstone ileus if it was applied within the first hours after admission.  At the same time other diagnostic approaches were less informative.
