[Carotid endarterectomy and stenting in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis and contralateral occlusion].  AIM
To determine surgical risk factors and to compare early outcomes after carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis and contralateral occlusion.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
132 patients were enrolled.  62 and 70 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting respectively.
Early postoperative results were compared depending on type of surgical intervention and presence of risk factors.  RESULTS
Significant difference between groups was only found for incidence of neuropathy of the cranial nerves.  It was established that cardiac comorbidities are risk factors for adverse events after carotid endarterectomy.
Stable (homogeneous) atherosclerotic plaque with clear contour and no ulceration is optimal for carotid stenting.
