It is known to develop from the glandula elements present in this organ.  The authors report a clinical observation of adenoid cystic carcinoma in the form of an exophytic tumour of the pale pink colour having a smooth surface and the well-pronounced vascular patterns at the base.
The neoplasm is localized in the arytenoid and retroarytenoid cartilage regions.  Being of 3.5-4 cm in size, the tumour causes the narrowing of the larynx in its posterior portions and restricts its mobility.
Bearing in mind the considerable extension of the neoplastic process, we undertook laryngectomy including the resection of the orolaryngopharynx and the cervical portion of the oesophagus, the subtotal resection of the thyroid gland and the simultaneous reconstruction of the orolaryngopharynx.
