[Laboratory predictors of delirium tremens severity].  AIM
To identify the most informative predictors of delirium tremens severity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  A total of 105 patients from a department of urgent drug addiction help of the Chelyabinsk regional addiction hospital were examined.
To find the most informative predictors of delirium tremens severity, we studied a relationship between biogenic amine metabolism and changes in cortisol levels in dependence of patients' condition.
The level of catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine) and their precursor 3'4-dioxyphenylalanine in blood and daily urine, serotonin and histamine content, thrombocyte monoamine oxidase B activity, urinary tribulin activity, and serum cortisol levels of the patients with different severity of delirium tremens were assessed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A prognostic significance of cortisol and blood serotonin levels, and thrombocyte monoamine oxidase activity was demonstrated.
A decrease in cortisol levels was the most negative predictor.
