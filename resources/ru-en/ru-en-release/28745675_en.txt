[A rare case of rapidly progressing primary diffuse meningeal sarcomatosis of the brain and spinal cord].
Currently the differential diagnosis of anaplastic meningiomas often is quite complex.

The article presents a clinical case, representing a rare and difficult to diagnose variant of anaplastic meningioma with extremely aggressive nature of the current and widespread involvement of the brain and spinal cord.
