[On the importance of multidrug-resistant strains of pathogenic microorganisms in ophthalmic practice].  This is a review of epidemiological, microbiological and ophthalmological publications on the importance of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains in medical, particularly ophthalmological, care.
Current state of pharmaceutical market and wide variety of generics confuses doctor's (including ophthalmologist's) sense of decision-making on the optimum antibiotic for the treatment of purulent inflammation.  Indiscriminate use of antibiotics contributes to multiple drug resistance in bacteria.
The world returns to the pre-antibiotic era, in which there was no treatment for severe infectious and inflammatory diseases.
The most dangerous multiresistant strains known to medical science and their role in etiology of inflammatory eye diseases are listed in the article.
Since neonatal conjunctivitis and postoperative endophthalmitis are the most common ocular inflammatory diseases caused by nosocomial multiresistant bacteria, their etiological classification is also described.
Emergence of antibiotic resistance to most frequently used ophthalmic agents and prevention strategies are discussed.
