[Improvement of the efficacy and safety of treatment of epilepsy using new forms of controlled release antiepileptic drugs].  The paper summarizes the results of the studies on the efficacy and safety of a new form of controlled release levetiracetam XR (Lev XR) compared to standard tablet immediate release form in treatment of resistant partial seizures.
The authors present the data on the bioequivalence and absorption of LevXR related to the meal and therapeutic doses in the range between 1000 to 3000 mg/day.  It has been concluded that LevXR has high efficacy and safety due to its stable plasma concentration during the day.
The results meet FDA bioequivalence criteria and, in authors opinion, can be recommended as drug of choice in additional treatment of partial seizures in patients above 12 years of age.
