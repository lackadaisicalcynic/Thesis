[Clinical and anatomical features of congenital microphthalmia and anophthalmia in children and conservative methods of rehabilitation].  AIM
To develop a comprehensive classification system of distinctive clinical and anatomical features of congenital microphthalmia and anophthalmia in children and to specify indications, contraindications, and optimal timing of the primary and subsequent prosthetic treatment.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 70 patients with congenital micro- or anophthalmia aged from 1 month to 12 years were examined.  Besides the routine ophthalmic examination, all patients underwent eye and orbit ultrasound (axial length measurement and B-scan), computed tomography of the orbits and skull, and immunological tests for infectious diseases (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays).
RESULTS  Basing on the examination
RESULTS  we have determined the common types of congenital micro- and anophthalmia in children.
We have also developed a stepwise prosthetic treatment aimed at better cosmetic rehabilitation.
Indications and contraindications for the use of ocular prostheses in children with congenital micro- and anophthalmia have been identified.
CONCLUSION
The proposed method of stepwise prosthetics is the principal option for conservative rehabilitation of children with congenital micro- or anophthalmia.
