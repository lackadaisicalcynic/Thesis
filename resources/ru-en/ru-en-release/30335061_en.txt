[A method for preparation of an endothelial cell monolayer sample from the blood vessel intima].  The paper describes the procedure to prepare endothelial cell monolayer samples from the vascular intima, which is suitable for studying various morphological processes.
To obtain high-quality multicellular specimens, it is recommended to preliminarily remove excess tissue from the outside of the vessel and to free the intima; ways to dry the surface and to separate endothelial cells are examined.
The paper gives the figures of specimens stained by the Romanowsky-Giemsa method and identifies factor VIII, an endothelial marker, and Chlamydia pneumoniae inclusions in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells.
