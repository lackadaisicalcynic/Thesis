[Treatment of inflammatory complications of colic diverticular disease at the emergency surgical care hospital].
AIM  To assess an effectiveness of minimally invasive and laparoscopic technologies in treatment of inflammatory complications of colic diverticular disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 150 patients who were divided into control and main groups.  Survey included ultrasound, X-ray examination and abdominal computerized tomography.
In the main group standardized treatment algorithm including minimally invasive and laparoscopic technologies was used.  RESULTS
In the main group 79 patients underwent conservative treatment, minimally invasive (ultrasound-assisted percutaneous drainage of abscesses) and laparoscopic surgery that was successful in 78 (98.7%) patients.
CONCLUSION
Standardized algorithm reduces time of treatment, incidence of postoperative complications, mortality and the risk of recurrent inflammatory complications of colic diverticular disease.
Also postoperative quality of life was improved.
