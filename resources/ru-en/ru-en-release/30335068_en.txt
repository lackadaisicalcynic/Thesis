[Correlation of the genetic profile and features of the rehabilitation after ischemic stroke].
AIM  To examine an effect of polymorphisms of lipid peroxidation system genes on the risk of ischemic stroke as well as the prognosis of disease outcome after rehabilitation measures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Seven hundred and forty-six patients with ischemic stroke and 500 patients of the control group were genotyped for 6 polymorphisms of lipid peroxidation system genes: HIF1a C1772T, ApoE Σ2/Σ3/Σ4, MnSOD C47T, GPX-1 C599T, BDNF G196T, p22phox C242T.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The HIF1a C1772T polymorphism was a significant risk factor for the development of ischemic stroke with the odds ratio 1.702 (p<0.05).
For GPX-1 C599T and BDNF G196T polymorphisms, a trend towards a higher frequency of heterozygous genotypes was shown in patients with the negative dynamics of neurological status.
The results suggest the influence of genetic variants not only on the risk of stroke but also on treatment and rehabilitation outcomes.
