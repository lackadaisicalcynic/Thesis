[Computed tomography in diagnostics of extravasal influence of thyroid nodules].
AIM
To estimate role of contrast-enhanced MDCT in diagnosis of common carotid arteries and internal jugular veins compression by thyroid nodules.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Contrast-enhanced MDCT of neck and mediastinum was performed in 15 patients with benign thyroid nodules in addition to conventional clinical survey and Doppler imaging of common carotid arteries and internal jugular veins.
Thyroid volume ranged from 71.4 to 296 cm3.  Cervical great vessels deviation, their dislocation and deformation because of compression were revealed in 14 patients.
Partial and complete compression within transverse processes of cervical vertebrae was diagnosed in 7 cases.
It was concluded that dislocated common carotid arteries per se can compress and deform internal jugular veins.
Blood flow in veins is absent if they are compressed throughout.  If jugular vein is compressed behind sternum only its ectasia may be observed.
RESULTS
Vascular geometry was restored after extravasal compression elimination.  Contrast-enhanced MDCT should be included into survey program of patients with thyroid nodules.
