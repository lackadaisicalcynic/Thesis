[Regional metabolic changes of supraventricular tissue in patients with relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis].
AIM
To evaluate and compare the intensity of changes in a regional meta-analysis in relapsing-remitting and secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (RRS and SPMS).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of longitudinal studies of multiple sclerosis (MS) using positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging are presented.  RESULTS
In MS, metabolic changes precede the structural ones.  The markers of neuronal and axonal dysfunction (a decrease in NAA/Cr ratios in the white and grey matters, without the structural changes) are recorded in the early stages.
The metabolic changes in the grey matter were recorded mostly in the middle frontal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex.  With the increase of duration and severity of MS, the metabolic changes spread to the other regions of supraventricular areas.
The distribution of degeneration zones is related to MS course.
CONCLUSION
There is substantial evidence on the irreversible damage of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex in SPMS that confirms the vulnerability of the frontal cingulate gyrus in MS.
