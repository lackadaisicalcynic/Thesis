[Pleiotropic effects of phlebotropic drugs: from pharmacological advantages to adverse drug interaction].  A distinctive property of phlebotropic drugs consists in their intrinsic capability of exerting pronounced pleiotropic (multiple) effects.
The authors discuss the fundamental mechanisms of pleiotropy, advantages and disadvantages of various types of targeted therapy (mono- and polytargeted therapy) in treatment of chronic venous diseases.
Special attention is paid to analysing the nature of adverse drug interactions, methods of reducing the risk of their development.
An electronic service known as the Drug Interactions Checker is proposed as a tool for assessing drug interactions in everyday practice of the angiologist/phlebologist.
