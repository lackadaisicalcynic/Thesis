[Bioethics in Russian neurology and epileptology].  Historical roots and further development of bioethics in domestic neurology and epileptology are considered.
The main bioethical principles were established during the formation of the Russian clinical school and neurosciences.  It is most distinctly seen in the development of bioethics in neurology and epileptology.
In the author's opinion, the Russian scientist V.M. Bekhterev had played a prominent role in the field.  In the time when the term "bioethics" was not coined and its principles were not formulated, V.M. Bekhterev had created the Russian league against epilepsy and established the foundations of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) as the organizations working on the problems of medical and social care to patients with epilepsy.
In Russia, the Russian society of neurologists has been doing a great work in the field.
