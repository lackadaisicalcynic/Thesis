[OPTIMIZATION OF REPARATIVE OSTEOGENESIS JAWS ON AGING (PRECLINICAL STUDIES)].  The article presents the results of pre-clinical studies of the possibility of optimization of reparative osteogenesis in postoperative bone cavities of the jaws in old rats with a peptide bioregulator of Kartalaks.
Using histological and morphometric methods in the experimental study, it is shown that the use of Kartalaks positive effect on the course of the process of reparative osteogenesis of the mandible in old rats.
The features of the Kartalaks drug investigated for optimization of reparative osteogenesis jaw during aging.  It is found that by using Kartalaks in old animals to 30 days before the surgical intervention, the process of reparative osteogenesis standard defect of mandible occurs at early stages (before 30 days), similar to the control.
The deadlines for 60-120 days from the beginning of the experiment using the peptide bioregulator Kartalaks, noted the formation of a complex regenerate tissue containing a smaller proportion of connective tissue and cartilage, as well as more advanced remodeling of newly formed bone tissue compared with the control group, and older animals who received the drug after performing surgery.
