[Polymorphism in the regulatory regions -С2578A and +C936T of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) gene in Russian women with rheumatoid arthritis].  AIM
To analyze polymorphism in the regulatory regions of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The investigation enrolled 257 female patients with RA.
A control group consisted of 297 women without chronic diseases.
The investigators examined the single-nucleotide polymorphism of VEGF-А2578С in the promoter region (rs699947) and that of VEGF+С936Т 3 in the retranslated region (rs3025039) of the gene.
Genotyping was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
RESULTS
There was an increase in the frequency of VEGF+936 CT and a reduction in that of the VEGF+936СС genotypes in the seronegative patients as compared to the healthy women.
The VEGF+936СС genotype frequency was higher in the patients with seropositive RA than in the subgroup of seronegative patients.
The frequency of the VEGF-2578СС genotype was increased in the patients with RA and rheumatoid nodules, as compared to the healthy women.
CONCLUSION
The data presented suggest that the presence of certain VEGF gene variants located in the regulatory regions may reflect the nature of immunopathological mechanisms in RA.
