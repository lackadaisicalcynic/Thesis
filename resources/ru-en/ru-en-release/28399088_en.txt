[The forensic medical evaluation of traumatic and spontaneous ruptures of the organs affected by the tumours].  The present article was designed to report the results of the analysis of the cases of traumatic and spontaneous ruptures of the organs affected by the tumours based on the original observations and the literature data.
It is shown that the probability of the tumour rupture depends on its histological type, localization, the size, and the distance from the capsule of the affected organ, the degree of involvement of the major blood vessels, the severity of the necrotic changes, the presence of cysts in the neoplasm, and the regimens of radio- and chemotherapy.
Moreover, the rupture can be facilitated by anticoagulation therapy, intake or oral contraceptives, pregnancy, concomitant diseases, alcoholic intoxication, splenomegaly, and hypocoagulation resulting from dissemination of the neoplastic process or the metastatic lesions of the liver.
Even a minimal injury to the skin can provoke the tumour rupture associated with the fatal hemorrhage.  A delayed rupture within a few hours or days is possible.
