[Early outcomes of open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy].  AIM
To study immediate results of open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy for malignancies.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 158 patients with cancer of biliopancreatoduodenal area.  Open procedures were performed in 118 cases, laparoscopic in 17, robot-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy - in 23.
RESULTS
After 'standard' pancreatoduodenectomy 31 (62.0%) complications were registered, after laparoscopic - 12 (24.0%) and aWfter robot-assisted surgery - 7 (14.0%) complications.
Relationship between probability of complications was absent (correlation coefficient 0.10491), however, significant differences in incidence of complications after various surgical approaches were observed (c2=6.8832; df=0.9679; p<0.05).  CONCLUSION  Laparoscopic and robot-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy was not followed by advanced early postoperative morbidity.
Moreover, minimally invasive approach was associated with improved outcomes.
