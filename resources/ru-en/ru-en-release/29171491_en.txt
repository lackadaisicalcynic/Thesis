AIM
To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pericyazine in the treatment of patients with mental disorders manifesting with psychopathic-like symptoms and correction of pathocharacterological disorders in patients with personality disorders during the short-term admission to the hospital or the long-term outpatient treatment.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty-three patients with schizotypal personality disorder and organic personality disorder with psychopathic-like symptoms and pathocharacterological changes within the diagnosis of dissocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder were examined.
Patients received pericyazine during the short-term admission to the hospital (6 weeks) or the long-term outpatient treatment (6 month).  Efficacy, tolerability and compliance were assessed in the study.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Treatment with pricyazine was effective in all patients.
The improvement was seen in patients with organic personality disorders and patients with personality disorders (psychopathy).  The maximal effect was observed in inpatients and this effect remained during outpatient treatment.
The improvement of mental state of patients with schizotypal personality disorder achieved during inpatient treatment with pericyazine continued during the long-term outpatient treatment.
Side-effects were restricted to extrapyramidal symptoms, the frequency of metabolic syndrome was low.
During outpatient treatment, the compliance was higher if the patient was managed by the same psychiatrist during inpatient- and outpatient treatment.
