Moscow Regional Research Clinical Institute, Russia Resume: in this report we present the results on the use of the method of layer-by-layer (LbL) for obtaining antimicrobial coatings for biomedical implants.
As the substrates were used silicon titanium implants and silicon plate.  For the obtaining multilayer coatings on the surfaces of the samples were used as the polycation--chitosan and polyanion--carboxymethylcellulose sodium.
On the surface multilayer were deposited antibacterial preparations: Triclosan-2,4,4'trichloro-2' hydroxyphenyl ether, silver ions and iodine.
Microbiological studies were conducted on the museum strains: E. coli, Candida and Staf.  Preliminary antibacterial studies on these microorganisms showed high activity multilayer coating containing triclosan.
