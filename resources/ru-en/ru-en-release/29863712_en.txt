[The detection of the biomolecular markers of the axonal damage resulting from the craniocerebral injury by the immunohistological methods].  The objective of the present study was to define and evaluate the parameters of validity of the diagnostic signs of the diffuse axonal damage resulting from the craniocerebral injury with the use of the immunohistological reaction for the presence of amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the brain tissue associated with the craniocerebral injury.
Both histological and immunological methods were used.  The positive beta-APP reaction was documented in 2 of the six cases.
It is concluded that the positive results of the immunohistological reaction for the presence of beta-APP protein provide an additional information about the mechanism behind the damage and confirm the diagnosis of the craniocerebral injury in the cases when its macroscopic signs are either absent or unapparent.
