[Intraperitoneal and retromuscular abdominal wall repair using ultra-light and titanium-containing polypropylene mesh (experimental research)].
AIM  To study experimental possibility of light, ultra-light and titanium-containing endoprostheses implantation for postoperative hernias correction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Abdominal wall repair was simulated in 72 rabbits.
In the first group polypropylene mesh with fibers diameter of 90 microns and surface density of 36 g/m2 was used.
In the second group we applied polypropylene mesh with fibers diameter of 65 microns and thin layer of titanium.
Their surface density was 16 g/m2.
Intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) and sublay retromuscular (SRM) techniques were used in group 1 and 2 respectively.
Animals were taken out from the experiment in 30 and 60 days.
Adhesive process in implantation area was evaluated using the method of Egiev V.N. and Lyadov V.K.
RESULTS
The most pronounced adhesive process was observed in IPOM series.
Type of endoprosthesis and terms of postoperative period did not significant effect adhesive process.
SRM method was associated with significantly less pronounced adhesions.
Analysis of all data showed that severity of adhesive process was significantly higher in IPOM series compared with SRM technique.
CONCLUSION
Our study showed that severity of abdominal adhesive process associated with repair using ultra-light mesh is completely determined by surgical technique and did not depend on type of endoprosthesis and terms of postoperative period.
Described implants should be used for retromuscular implantation rather intraperitoneal position.
