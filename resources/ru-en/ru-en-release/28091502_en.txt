[Combined therapy of cerebrovascular disorders with neuroprotectors].
Safety of drugs is one of the priorities of modern medicine.
The goal of pharmacological treatment is a search for effective and safety drugs as well as a study of possibilities of combined using of the drugs with opposite effects.
Basing on the possible therapeutic interactions, 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate can be recommended as a basic medication for patients with cerebrovascular diseases to normalize the energy metabolism of brain cells.  The complex use of cholinergic drugs with different neuroprotective effects is effective from the first hours after admission.
Cholinergic drugs (citicoline or choline alfoscerate) as the drugs of the first choice should be justified taking into consideration dysfunction of the brain system activation.  Patient's age, the level of consciousness, somatic pathology, previous strokes, cognitive impairment are predictors of treatment efficacy.
