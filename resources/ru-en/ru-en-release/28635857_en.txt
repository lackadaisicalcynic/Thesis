[Obesity in metabolic syndrome, as well as kidney dysfunction].  The presence of metabolic syndrome (MS) in a patient allows him to be assigned to a group at high risk for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
In addition, MS negatively affects not only the heart and vessels, but also kidney function, which leads to chronic kidney disease (CKD).
MS is pathogenetically associated with CKD and is an independent prognostic factor of the development of the latter, namely, the involvement of the kidney frequently determines prognosis and quality of life in these patients.  The paper gives a modern view on the concept of MS and CKD and considers its main diagnostic criteria, etiology, and pathogenesis.
The study of the relationships between MS and CKD may suggest that the high prevalence of kidney dysfunction in the general population is largely determined by metabolic nephropathies, including obesity-related nephropathy.
The identification of risk factors and poor prognostic markers in this category of patients seems to be extremely important for the early diagnosis of the disease and their timely elimination is one of the main approaches to the comprehensive prevention of CKD in these patients.
