[The comparative assessment of the vocal function in the professional voice users and non-occupational voice users in the late adulthood].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and functional condition of the voice apparatus in the elderly patients and to elaborate recommendations for the prevention of disturbances of the vocal function in the professional voice users.
This comprehensive study involved 95 patients including the active professional voice users (n=48) and 45 non-occupational voice users at the age from 61 to 82 years with the employment history varying from 32 to 51 years.
The study was designed to obtain the voice characteristics by means of the subjective auditory assessment, microlaryngoscopy, video laryngostroboscopy, determination of maximum phonation time (MPT), and computer-assisted acoustic analysis of the voice with the use of the MDVP Kay Pentaxy system.  The level of anxiety of the patients was estimated based on the results of the HADS questionnaire study.
It is concluded that the majority of the disturbances of the vocal function in the professional voice users have the functional nature.
It is concluded that the method of neuro-muscular electrophonopedic stimulation (NMEPS) of laryngeal muscles is the method of choice for the diagnostics of the vocal function of the voice users in the late adulthood.
It is recommended that the professional vocal load for such subjects should not exceed 12-14 hours per week.
Rational psychotherapy must constitute an important component of the system of measures intended to support the working capacity of the voice users belonging to this age group.
