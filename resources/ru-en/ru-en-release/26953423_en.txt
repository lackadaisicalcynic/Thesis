[Clinical and microbiological rationale for laser removal of infected epithelia in patients with periodontitis].
The aim of the study was to identify clinical microbiological criteria for the necessity of removal of infected epithelium in the periodontal pocket in patients with periodontitis.
A total of 90 patients diagnosed with periodontal disease of varying severity were assessed.  Clinical examination of the patients was performed, including the definition of index numbers and microbiological diagnosis of the content of periodontal pocket and periodontal tissues by biopsy culture seeding.
Epithelial integration of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria was established, indicating the need for a differentiated approach to the removal of gingival epithelium.
Diagnostic criteria for deepitalization was identified: marked inflammatory response of periodontal tissues, characterized by performance indexes PMA > 50%, Mulleman > 1.5, Svrakov > 2.7, correlated with the degree of contamination biopsy 4IgKOE/ml and Candida spp.
2IgKOE/ml.
