[Enhanced recovery program for colorectal surgery in cinical practice.  Survey of surgeons of the Russian Federation].
AIM  To analyze RF surgeons' attitude to accelerated recovery program (ERP) and to determine how often it is used in daily work.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
223 physicians from 42 Russian regions were interviewed in 2017.  RESULTS
ERP is unknown among 11.7% of specialists; 8.9% heard about ERP but did not think that it is used in the Russian Federation; 16.6% know but do not apply the program; 55.6% use some elements of ERP; complete application of ERP was found in 7.2% of surgeons.  This technique is more often used by more active surgeons (p = 0.001) and less often - by female surgeons (p = 0.0066).
The most controversial and difficult elements of ERP are administration of carbohydrate mixtures prior to surgery, optimal body temperature maintenance, restrictive protocol of infusion therapy, refusal mechanical intestinal depuration and routine abdominal drainage, and administrative control over the protocol.  CONCLUSION
The majority of surgeons are ready to apply ERP.  Some elements are difficult to apply for use in real healthcare.
More educational activities are needed for wider and complete use of the protocol.  New scientific available data should be used to improve this approach.
