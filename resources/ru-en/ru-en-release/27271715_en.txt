[Evolution of diagnostic methods for cicatrical tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia].
AIM  To analyze the role of ray functional computerized diagnostic technologies in assessment of the state of tracheal wall in cicatricial stenosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 45 patients with cicatricial tracheal stenosis during August 2013 -- March 2015.
Fibrobronchoscopy, multislice computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and lungs function examination were performed.
For the first time dynamic (functional) CT and MRI were included in research algorithm.  These techniques have not been used for cicatricial stenosis and tracheomalacia in our country until this moment.
Circular resection with anastomosis was made in 38 patients and stage reconstructions were preferred in 7 cases.
Last ones had advanced tracheomalacia on the background of cicatrical stenosis that forced to abandon from tracheal resection.
So time to treatment and incidence of complications and recurrences were reduced and the results were improved.
CONCLUSION  Endoscopy remains the main method of diagnosis of tracheal stenosis despite its invasiveness.
Data of cicatrical transformation of tracheal wall per se can be obtained non-invasively using dynamic CT and MRI.
These techniques help to identify or exclude tracheomalacia.  They potentially complement fibrobronchoscopy and may be preferable to assess perioperative intramural pathological changes of the trachea.
