[A case of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in an infant].
AIM
To present the clinical history, vaccination status, features of the clinical picture, composition of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), results of laboratory and instrumental examinations of a patient with vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In 2017, a child, aged 15 month, mistakenly vaccinated with the first dose of bivalent (types 1 & 3) polioviruses oral vaccine (OPV) was followed up.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Clinical parameters of VAPP in the recipient of OPV are considered.
Clinical features of disease caused by wild poliovirus and VAPP are compared.  The disease was characterized by sudden onset, recurrence, short (2-4 days) period of progression of paresis, persistent residual effects, CSF protein-cell dissociation.
It is emphasized that the occurrence of VAPP cases reflects primarily immunization defects.
