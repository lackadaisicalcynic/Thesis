[The otoneurological examination of a patient suffering from dizziness].  The up-to-date bedside otoneurological examination of the dizzy patients consists of a number of tests and procedures of paramount importance for the localization and diagnostics of the causes underlying dizziness.  Recent progress in neurootology made it possible to improve the quality of physical examination and diagnostics; thereby, it promoted the choice of the most adequate treatment.  The authors maintain that the modern otoneurological examination must include the following mandatory stages: the measurement of the head tilt and the eye position; the assessment of the presence and the character of nystagmus, oculomotor reactions (saccades, smooth pursuit movements, optokinetic reflex), and vestibular-ocular reflex; the performance of provocative tests and positioning maneuvers; posture and balance control estimation; evaluation of the hearing function.
