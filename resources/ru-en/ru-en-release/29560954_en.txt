It was made a prospective comparative study within 2007-2015.  Inclusion criteria were verified chronic DD (>6 weeks after the first attack) and bowel resection followed by primary anastomosis.
EXCLUSION CRITERIA  contraindications for pneumoperitoneum, BMI ≥35 kg/m2, infiltrate dimension >10 cm, preoperatively non-excluded neoplasm.
There were 80 (58.8%) females aged 57.2±6.2 (24-83) years.  Main group consisted of 75 patients after laparoscopic-assisted procedures, 61 were in control group (open ones).
Both groups were homogeneous in age, gender, BMI, type of chronic complications, extent of inflammation, extent of bowel resection, surgery time (211.1 vs 206.3 min; p=0.16), incidence of preventive stoma (12.9 vs 19.7%; p=0.32) and complications rate (10.7 vs 14.7%; p=0.47).  Maximal time of surgery was noted in case of chronic abdominal mass with statistically significance for main group (240.0±12.2 min vs 207.6±13.7 min; р=0.01).
Main group showed significant higher rate of stapler anastomoses (66.7 vs 22.9%; р<0.0001), less intraoperative blood loss (100 ml vs 350 ml; р=0.001).  Early postoperative period was significantly shorter in main group (9.5±0.4 days vs 12.9±1.2 days, р=0.02).
