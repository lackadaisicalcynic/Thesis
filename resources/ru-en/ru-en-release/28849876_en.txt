[Age-related aspects of the involvement of heat shock proteins in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis].  The purpose of research - to establish features of heat shock proteins (HSPs) levels change, chemokines and collagen degradation marker in the blood of patients with osteoarthritis in the age aspect.
The results of the study shown, HSPs participate in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis is complex and multi-layered process.
HSP70 acts as an immunologic adjuvant reactions involving chemokine CXCL17, under the influence of external risk factors.
Low levels of HSPs not allow them to act as autoimmune factor interaction with Toll-like receptors of immune cells, but obviously it contributes for CXCL17-dependent activation of dendritic cells and macrophages, which initiate local inflammation involving key cytokines, including TNF-Î±.
Chondrocytes and osteoblasts, subjected cytokine attack, are not able to reply fully enhanced expression of HSP70 and HSP27 for whatever reason.
With aging, the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis enters the phase of the local tissue reaction, where significant role have processes hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and osteo-like cells of subchondral bone.
