[The age-dependent changes of sella turcica, frontal and sphenoid sinuses].  This article is designed to report the results of analysis of the literature publications concerning age-specific changes in the configuration of the sella turcica, frontal and sphenoid sinuses during the life span of a human being.
It is shown that the subjects above the age of 20-25 years undergo age-dependent variations of the morphometric characteristics of the sella turcica, frontal and sphenoid sinuses.  It suggests the necessity of the further development of the research methods with a view to increasing the number of techniques used in forensic medicine designed to enhance the accuracy of estimation of the human biological age.
