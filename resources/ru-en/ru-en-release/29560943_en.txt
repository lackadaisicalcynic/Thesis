[Spinal mechanisms of neuroplasticity induced by neuromidin in treatment of traumatic neuropathies].
AIM  To analyze the spinal mechanisms of neuroplastic changes induced by neuromidin (ipidacrine) in a model of traumatic axonotomy of the sciatic nerve in rats.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The histological study of the material from the anterior horn (lumbar portion of spinal cord) was performed in 6 rats using electron microscopy.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The comparative analysis of neuromorphological changes in rats of control and main groups revealed the neuroprotective and modifying effects of neuromidin on the spinal neuroplasticity.
