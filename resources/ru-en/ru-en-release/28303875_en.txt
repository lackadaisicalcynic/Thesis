[Endoscopic ligation in treatment and prevention of bleeding from esophageal varices].  AIM
To demonstrate the efficacy of endoscopic ligation in treatment and prevention of bleeding from esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We performed a retrospective analysis of 338 patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent ligation for the period 2009 - May 2016.
There were 209 (61.8%) men and 129 (38.2%) women.
In this group 511 ligations were performed.
The total number of ligated nodes was 4086.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Ligation was effective in 502 (98.2%) cases.
In 9 (1.8%) cases endoscopic ligation was ineffective and Blackmore tube was required.
The main cause of failed procedure was pre- or intraoperative active bleeding from esophageal varices.
Complications in this group can be considered 3 cases of bleeding during ligation.
CONCLUSION
Endoscopic ligation is highly effective (from an economic and medical points of view) treatment and prevention of bleeding from esophageal varices in patients with liver cirrhosis.
