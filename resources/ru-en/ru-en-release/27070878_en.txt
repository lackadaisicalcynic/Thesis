[Analysis of the clinical application of epidermal growth factor ("Heberprot-P") and bioplastic material ("Collost") in treatment of skin and soft tissues defects in patients with diabetic foot syndrome].  RELEVANCE
Currently, there is increasing the number of diabetic foot patients with tissues defects.  The local treatment of this pathology against the backdrop of diabetic angiopathy and polyneuropathy is a topical issue.
AIM
Treatment of wound defects in patients with neuroischemic form of diabetic foot syndrome; study of the effectiveness of collagen implants and gene-therapy technologies in wound closure.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The comparative study was conducted for analyzing clinical effects of "Heberprot-P" and bioplastic material "Collost" on wound healing process in patients with verified diagnosis "diabetic foot syndrome" on the base of City Clinical Hospital â„–81(Moscow) and "Diabetic Foot" center (Kazan).
RESULTS
The article shows the availability, methodology, results of combination treatment of wound defects of lower limbs in DFS patients with gen-therapy methods and bioplastic materials based on native type I collagen.
CONCLUSION
The use of bioplastic materials based on native type I collagen for treatment of tissue defects in patients with diabetic foot is preferably than the use of epidermal growth factor.
