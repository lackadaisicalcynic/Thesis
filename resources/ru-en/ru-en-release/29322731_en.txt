[Age changes in connective tissue structures of the stomach.]  The study of paravasal connective tissue of the stomach was carried out on the preparations of 80 men corpses of three age groups: the first period of adulthood (n=20), the elderly (n=30) and senile (n=30) ages.
With the help of standard histological and histochemical methods, the features of the age-related variability of the fiber composition were established; the level of apoptosis and proliferation in fibroblasts has been investigated with the help of immunohistochemical methods.
The regularities of the structural organization of the paravasal connective tissue of the stomach during the period of biological stability (the first period of adulthood), as well as its age transformations at the stages of postnatal ontogeny (in the older age groups), were revealed.
