[Chronic cerebral ischemia associated with Raynaud's syndrome].  Over the last years, a number of patients with chronic cerebral ischemia has been increased significantly.
Compensatory possibilities of the brain and cerebral circulatory system are so great that even serious disturbances of blood circulation could not cause clinical signs of brain dysfunction for a long time.  At the same time, long-term ischemia can lead to peripheral local disturbances of microcirculation that is appears to be a first signal of the problems with homeostasis.
Therefore, Raynaud's syndrome may be one of the predictors of standard symptoms of chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI).  This phenomenon is explicitly considered as a sign of blood circulation impairment while the pathogenetic mechanism of vascular arterial bed instability is completely ignored.
Detailed study of clinical correlations of Raynaud's syndrome in CCI would help to develop a common pharmacotherapeutic approach to its treatment.
