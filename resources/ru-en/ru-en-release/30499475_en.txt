[The use of the three-dimensional modeling for the elucidation of the mechanism of injury formation and identification of the injurious agents].  The article reports a case of the application of the thee-dimensional models of an injury on a corpse and of a blunt trace-forming object with which it was presumably inflicted for the identification purposes.
The models were constructed based on a series of the digital photographs processed with the use of the specialized software program.  The work with the application of the three dimensional models made it possible to avoid disfiguring of the corpse, to determine the stages and conditions of infliction of the injury in the graphic editor software environment, and to arrive at the conclusion about the parts of the traumatic agent with which the injury was caused.
