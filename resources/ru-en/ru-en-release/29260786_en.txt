[The use of fenspiride for the combined treatment of exacerbation of chronic laryngitis].
The present study was carried out based at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of I.P. Pavlov First State Medical University of Saint-Petersburg.  The objective of this work was to elucidate the efficacy and safety of fenspiride therapy for the treatment of exacerbation of chronic laryngitis associated with an acute respiratory infection.
The patients comprising the main group received fenspiride (Eurespal, 'Servier', France) at the standard dose in addition to the conventional therapy with the use of antibiotics, inhalation, and voice rest.  The patients in the group of comparison were treated following the conventional protocol without fenspiride.
The clinical symptoms evaluated based on the scoring system, the results of videolaryngoscopy, and computer-assisted analysis of the voice were compared before and after treatment in the patients of both groups.  The results of the study have confirmed the high effectiveness and safety of fenspiride therapy of exacerbation of chronic laryngitis.
