[Primary granulocytic sarcoma of lacrimal gland].
The article presents clinical description and instrumental findings (ultrasound examination and multi-slice computed tomography of the orbits) of a rare lacrimal gland tumor, which precedes or concurs with acute myeloblastic leukemia.
Due to the low incidence of myeloid (granulocytic) sarcoma, it is not possible to develop a proper algorithm for its diagnosis and treatment.  Few descriptions that are available in the literature neither give an idea of the variety of manifestations and the order of organ involvement, nor allow any vital prognosis.
Verification of the diagnosis can only be based on immunohistochemical findings of the primary tumor and bone marrow biopsy material.  The authors emphasize the importance of combination treatment (radiation therapy of the orbits and chemotherapy) in the prevention of leukemia.
