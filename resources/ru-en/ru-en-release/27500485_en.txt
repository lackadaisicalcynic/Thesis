[Determination of the blood myoglobin levels for the purpose of forensic medical expertise: the methodological peculiarities and the prospects for the further use].
The objective of the present work was to study the dependence of the blood myoglobin levels on the time of death, gender, and age of the subject, methods employed to analyze this protein, and the duration of storage of the biological materials after autopsy.  Myoglobin levels were measured in cadaveric blood of the subjects who had died as a result of acute cardiovascular insufficiency and chronic coronary heart disease in the passive hemagglutination reaction with the use of the erythrocyte diagnosticum and in the immunoturbodimetric test combined with the fixed time method.
It was shown that the blood myoglobin level depends on prescription of death coming, duration of storage of the biological materials, age and sex of the deceased subject.
It is concluded that the immunoturbodimetric method is characterized by the higher accuracy and better reproducibility than the passive hemagglutination reaction with the use of the erythrocyte diagnosticum.
