[Temporary biokeratoprostheses in total destruction of the cornea].  The paper presents an original method for temporary biokeratoprothetics in total destruction of the cornea, which consists of the following.
In the operating room a 12-mm disc is cut out of patient's conchal cartilage by a trephine and then thinned down to 1 mm with a blade.
The prepared autograft is placed in front of the iris completely overlapping corneal defect and sutured to the sclera with 10--12 U-shaped interrupted stitches using a 7/0 suture.  Between the stitches 0.2--0.3 ml of viscoelastic are injected into the anterior chamber.
Temporary blepharorrhaphy is done within the temporal one-third of the eyelids with a U-shaped suture 6/0.
The authors present an own clinical observation of patient D., aged 46, with purulent corneal ulcer and total destruction of the cornea.
In ophthalmic emergency, if no donor cornea is available, the described method allows to save the eyeball from its anatomical and functional loss.
Further routine keratoplasty or optical keratoprosthetics may bring some functional improvement.
