[Surgical treatment of severe spondylogenic cervical myelopathy by laminoplasty].
AIM
The objective of this study is to analyze the results of surgical treatment of patients with cervical myelopathy by laminoplasty.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The experience of surgical treatment of 30 patients (mean age 59.4) with cervical stenosis complicated with myelopathy was analyzed.
Hirabayashi laminoplasty was performed in 26 patients and Kurokawa laminoplasty was performed in 4 patients.  All patients were diagnosed with extended cervical spinal stenosis.
Diagnosis was based on the survey
RESULTS
including the dynamic clinical and neurological examination, x-ray study, CT, MRI, SSEP, and TMS.  Nurick scale, the scale of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA), and the recovery rate scale were used to assess the severity of myelopathy.
RESULTS
The long-term outcome of the clinical status, radiographic and neuroimaging parameters in patients with cervical myelopathy who underwent laminoplasty was evaluated.  CONCLUSION
Laminoplasty is the method of choice in the treatment of extended spondylogenic cervical stenosis.  Proper selection of patients based on clinical symptoms, assessment of the extent of stenosis, neurological examination and neuroimaging data leads to excellent results.
