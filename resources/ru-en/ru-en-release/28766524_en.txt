[The possibilities for sex determination based on the specific anatomical features of the human thyroid cartilage].
The objective of the present work was to study the specific morphological features in the structure of the human thyroid cartilage obtained from 35 men and 35 women.
The analysis and evaluation of 31 characteristics of the thyroid cartilage have demonstrated that its size in the men was bigger than in the women with the exception of the angle between the plates that was of a larger size in the women than in the men and showed the closest correlation with the sex.
The majority of other characteristics of the thyroid cartilage measured in the study either strongly or moderately correlated with the sex which makes it possible to use these measurements for the purpose of personality identification during forensic medical expertise.
