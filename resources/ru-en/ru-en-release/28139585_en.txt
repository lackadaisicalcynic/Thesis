[Endodontic configuration of the first permanent maxillary molar of west sibirian residents: (a cone - beam computed tomografy analysis in vivo)].  The aim of the study was to evaluate the first maxillary molars anatomic features among residents of Western Siberia by means of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).
The study included 356 patients aged 18-75 receiving CBCT (Planmeca ProMax 3D Max) as preparation for root canal treatment.  The results of CBCT were analyzed by Plunmeca Romexis Viewer software.
Root curvature degree was assessed by FKG Dentaire SA sample.
CBCT proved to be more relevant for root canal morphology assessment: unilateral or bilateral occurrences of additional mesiobuccal canal, root curvature degree and length, root penetration into the maxillary sinus.  CBCT data may facilitate successful endodontic diagnosis and treatment and may serve as a base for clinical guidelines in endodontic treatment of Western Siberia residents.
