[Chronic stress and mental disorders in patients with systemic scleroderma: Results of an interdisciplinary study].
AIM  To analyze of the prevalence of stressful factors and mental disorders (MDs), as well as their clinical psychopathological and clinical psychological characteristics to improve the comprehensive diagnosis and treatment of systemic scleroderma (SSD).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Examinations were performed in 110 patients  (predominantly women (n=97 (88.2%); mean age, 49.9±2.47 years) with a documented diagnosis of SSD (its mean duration, 7.25±0.42 years).
62 (56.4%) patients had limited SSD, 36 (32.7%) had diffuse SSD, and 12 (10.9%) had overlap syndrome.
The disease was rapidly and slowly progressive in 33 (30%) and 77 (70%) patients, respectively.
Oral glucocorticosteroids were used in 99 (90%) patients included in the study, cytotoxic drugs in 66 (60%), plaquenil in 33 (30%); 8 (7%) patients were treated with the biological agent rituximab.
All the patients were examined by a psychologist and a psychiatrist.
The psychopathological diagnosis of MD was made during a semistructured interview in accordance with the ICD-10 criteria.
The Montgomery-Asberg depression and Hamilton anxiety rating scales were used to evaluate the severity of depression and anxiety, respectively.
All patients underwent a clinical and psychological examination, including tests assessing memory, attention, and logical thinking, as well as projective techniques.
RESULTS
MDs were detected in 91 (83%) patients with SSD.
There was a preponderance of depressive disorders in 74 (67.3%) patients: chronic (dysthymia in 33 (30%) patients)) and recurrent (recurrent depressive disorder in 34 (31%)) depressions.
Cognitive impairment (CI) of varying severities was diagnosed in 100% of the patients.
Schizotypal personality disorder was stated in 44 (40%) patients.
90% of patients were found to have chronic psychic traumas mainly as parental deprivation in childhood (in children less than 11 years of age).
76.7% of the SSD cases developed recurrent episodes of depression in the presence of long-term MD or had a history of the episodes.
There was no relationship of MD to gender, age, duration of SSD and its individual clinical manifestations.
The nature of SSD treatment did not affect the frequency and spectrum of MD.
CONCLUSION
MDs, predominantly chronic and recurrent depression, and CI are characteristic of most SSD patients.
Multiple chronic stressful factors, both previous SSD and those over time, have commonly an impact on the mental health of patients with SSD.
