[Efficacy of baclosan in combined therapy of muscular-tonic pain syndrome in the early postoperative period in patients after microdiscectomy].
OBJECTIVE
A comparative analysis of the efficacy of baclosan in adjuvant therapy of muscular-tonic pain syndromes in the early postoperative period after microdiscectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  One hundred and three patients (65 men and 38 women, mean age 42Â±5,0 years) were divided into two sex- and age-matched groups depending on the treatment.
Patients of group 1 received baclosan in the combination with standard therapy, patients of group 2 received standard therapy.
Patients were assessed before treatment, at 3 and 10 days of treatment.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Treatment effect (maximum relief of pain and anxiety-depressive syndromes) was achieved earlier in group 1 compared to group 2.
The questions of substantiation of pathogenetic action of baclosan effect in the complex therapy of muscular-tonic pain syndromes in patients after microdiscectomy are considered.
