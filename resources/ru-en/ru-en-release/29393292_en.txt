[Surgery for intractable epilepsy in a patient with encephalocele of the temporal lobe: a case report].  We describe a case of surgical treatment of intractable temporal epilepsy in a female patient with congenital middle cranial fossa encephalocele.
We present clinical-anamnestic and neuroimaging data as well as the microscopic and macroscopic pictures of encephalocele.
We analyze outcomes of surgery for this pathology, which have been reported in the literature.
To date, there have been a few articles on this subject in the domestic literature.
The development of neuroimaging techniques and a growing number of verified encephalocele cases promote the widespread use of surgery for treatment of intractable epilepsy.
Congenital encephalocele should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intractable temporal epilepsy, and, if verified, surgical treatment is the method of choice in most cases.
