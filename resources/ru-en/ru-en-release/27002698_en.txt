[Social and hygienic aspects of mandible fractures in Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)].  Comprehensive social and hygienic survey of 209 patients with mandible fracture was conducted.
Their social features were: young adults, predominantly male, ethnicity mainly yakuts, temporarily unemployed, with secondary and post-secondary education and health behavior problems.
The majority of jaw injuries were caused by household (26.21 ± 0.92%) and street traumas (63.03 ± 0.46%).  High prevalence of major oral diseases depends strongly on the low sanitary culture, which had a negative impact on the development of posttraumatic complications.
