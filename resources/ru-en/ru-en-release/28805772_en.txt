[Diagnosis and treatment of extracranial internal carotid artery lesion combined with cerebrovascular malformation].
AIM
To analyze own experience of diagnosis and treatment of patients with extracranial internal carotid artery lesion and cerebrovascular malformations.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 16 patients with combined lesion of extracranial and intracranial internal carotid artery for the period January 2013 - December 2014.  Occlusive-stenotic lesion and tortuosity of ICA were observed in 11 and 5 cases respectively.
RESULTS
Incidence of combined ICA lesion was 5.2% (16 out of 308 observations of extracranial internal carotid artery lesion).
Surgical treatment was performed in 7 patients including two-stage intervention in 4 cases and simultaneous surgery in 3 cases.
Mean time between neurosurgical and vascular stages was 6 months.  Complications and mortality were absent.
CONCLUSION  Two-stage surgical approach with intracerebral vascular malformation correction followed by extracranial ICA reconstruction may be safe and effective in patients with combined lesion of ICA.
Further trials are necessary for certain conclusions.
