[The development of chronic heart failure in elderly patients with low ejection fraction at baseline in the acute phase of myocardial infarction].
There was performed analysis according to 5-year follow incidence of heart failure in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with low ejection fraction in A; the characteristics of chronic heart failure (CHF) in elderly and senile were determined; the value of a number of clinical and morphological parameters for prediction of CHF were studied.  The study included 135 patients of Intensive Care Unit with a diagnosis AMI showing according to the initial echocardiography reduced ejection fraction in the first 24-48 hours.
In the course of monitoring patients, routine methods of clinical examination were used, the main quantitative technique was echocardiography, qualitative indicators were assessed including by collecting anamnesis and filling out questionnaires for heart failure, and then standard statistical methods were used.  In the process of observation it was found that patients with acute myocardial infarction in acute elderly age worsens the prognosis of heart failure and mortality forecast, low ejection fraction in the acute period is a negative predictor of heart failure in all age groups, but more pronounced in the elderly.
Development and growth of CHF after AMI occurs, despite the growth of ejection fraction (EF) in both age groups.
CHF dynamics depends on the systolic and diastolic dysfunction.  In the older age group plays a decisive role systolic dysfunction.
