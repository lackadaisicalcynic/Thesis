[Experience in treating portal thromboses in patients with chronic myeloproliferative diseases].
Patients with myeloproliferative diseases (MPD) are noted to be at high risk for portal thromboses.  This problem gives rise to disability if it is untimely treated or resistant to therapy.
The paper gives the experience of the Outpatient Department of the Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, in using antithrombin III in MPD patients (3 patients with primary myelofibrosis, 3 with essential thrombocythemia) and acute and subacute portal vein thromboses resistant to therapy with direct anticoagulants.
In all 5 cases, the use of antithrombin III in combination with low-molecular-weight heparin showed a positive clinical effect as rapid relief of pain syndrome and comparatively early (3-week to 1.5-2-month) recanalization of thrombosed vessels.
Three clinical cases are described in detail.
