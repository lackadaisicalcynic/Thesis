[The distribution of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl-(1-hydroxycyclopentyl)(phenyl)acetate in the organism of the warm-blooded animals after its intra-gastric administration].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the distribution of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl-(1-hydroxycyclopentyl)(phenyl)acetate in the organism of the warm-blooded animals after its intra-gastric administration.
The methods applied in the study included thin layer chromatography in silicagel, aci-nitroprosalt staining reaction, UV-spectrophotometry,, and GC-mass spectrometry.
The identification and the quantitation of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl-(1-hydroxycyclopentyl)(phenyl)acetate in the organs and blood of the warm-blooded animals were carried out within 20, 150, and 360 min after a single intra-gastric administration of 1300 ml of this poisonous substance.
It was shown that the largest amounts of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl-(1-hydrpxycyclopentyl)(phenyl)acetate at the above time-points were present in the tissue of the stomach and small intestine, brain, muscles, spleen, and lungs of the animals.
