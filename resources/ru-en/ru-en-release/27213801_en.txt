AIM  To investigate the effectiveness of choline alphoscerate in patients with chronic ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) and coexisting cerebrovascular disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We performed a comprehensive examination of 51 patients aged 46--72 years (57.8Â±6.82 years on average) and diagnosed with OIS.  Patients were divided into two groups.
In group 1 (main group, 26 patients) the standard therapy was supplemented with choline alphoscerate.  Group 2 (controls, 25 patients) received the standard therapy only.
RESULTS
Clinical and functional examinations revealed a more rapid and stable improvement of visual acuity in the choline alphoscerate group.
CONCLUSION
Development and application of an adequate combination therapy for patients with ocular ischemic syndrome has yielded an increase in visual acuity, visual fields, and the mean light sensitivity of the retina as well as an improvement of ocular hemodynamics.
