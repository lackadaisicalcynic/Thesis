[An experience of using mebicar in patients with autonomic dysfunction associated with anxiety disorder].
BACKGROUND
Cognitive impairments are one of the most frequent and maladaptive factors in patients with autonomic dysfunction associated with anxiety disorder.
The majority of anxiolytics manage to compensate anxiety but suppress cognitive functions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-four patients with autonomic dysfunction and anxiety disorder, including 39 women (mean age 25±6.7 years) and 15 men (mean age 27±8.4 years), were treated with mebicar during 3 months.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A reduction in the degree of autonomic dysfunction and anxiety symptoms as well as a significant improvement of cognitive functions were noted.
Mebicar showed a good tolerability and minimum drug-related adverse events, and can be recommended as a first line anti-anxiety remedy in wide clinical practice.
