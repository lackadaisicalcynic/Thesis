[Extended laryngotracheal stenosis and osteochondroplastic tracheopathy].  The present article was designed to report a case of the surgical treatment of the patient presenting with extended laryngotrachealstenosis related toosteochondroplasticlaryngo- and tracheopathy.
The development of the osteochondroplastic transformation of the laryngeal and tracheal walls was regarded as a single pathomorphologicalprocess associated with chronic inflammation.
The study has demonstrated the relationship between the squamous cell hyperplasia in the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract and destructive chondro-perichondritis of the larynx and trachea accompanied by osteochondroplastic changes and concomitant extended laryngotracheal stenosis.
