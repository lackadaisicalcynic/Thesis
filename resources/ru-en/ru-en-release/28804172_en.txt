Antimicrobial resistance: from global agenda to national strategic plan, Thailand.
PROBLEM
In Thailand, antimicrobial resistance has formed a small component of national drug policies and strategies on emerging infectious diseases.  However, poor coordination and a lack of national goals and monitoring and evaluation platforms have reduced the effectiveness of the corresponding national actions.
APPROACH
On the basis of local evidence and with the strong participation of relevant stakeholders, the first national strategic plan on antimicrobial resistance has been developed in Thailand.  LOCAL SETTING
Before the development of the plan, ineffective coordination meant that antimicrobial resistance profiles produced at sentinel hospitals were not used effectively for clinical decision-making.  There was no integrated system for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, no system for monitoring consumption of antimicrobial drugs by humans, livestock and pets and little public awareness of antimicrobial resistance.
RELEVANT CHANGES  In August 2016, the Thai government endorsed a national strategic plan on antimicrobial resistance that comprised six strategic actions and five targets.
A national steering committee guides the plan's implementation and a module to assess the prevalence of household antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance awareness has been embedded into the biennial national health survey.  A national system for the surveillance of antimicrobial consumption has also been initiated.
LESSONS LEARNT  Strong political commitment, national ownership and adequate multisectoral institutional capacities will be essential for the effective implementation of the national plan.
A robust monitoring and evaluation platform now contributes to evidence-based interventions.  An integrated system for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance still needs to be established.
