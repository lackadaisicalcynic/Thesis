False formation of connective tissues have a great influence on structure and function of organs and tissues of the human body.

The algorithm of treatment patients with connective tissue dysplasia during metal ceramic dentures was developed and introduced into practical dentistry based on studying the morphology and functionality of dentition and clinical experience.
