[Peculiarities of barbituric acid derivatives acute poisoning clinical picture in patients of elderly and senile age and their therapy.]
In this article materials obtained during treatment of 61 patients with acute poisoning with phenobarbital, which is part of Corvalol and Valocordin, are presented.  It has already been established that phenobarbital acute poisoning in elderly and senile patients is accompanied by more frequent development of central nervous system, respiratory system (pneumonia) and cardiovascular system complications, which cause more severe clinical course and risk of an adverse outcome of acute poisoning.
This research has shown that for hypoxia correction during phenobarbital acute poisoning in elderly and senile patients it is advisable to include Reamberin in the treatment regimen, which has no adverse effects on central haemodynamic parameters and effectively reduces severity of metabolic disorders.
