[Button gastrostomy in children].  For the period January 2002 to December 2013 it was performed 84 interventions for introduction of gastrostomy tube.  The first group included 24 open operations and the second group had 60 laparoscopic operations by using of button devices MIC-KEY (Kimberly-Clark, Roswell, USA) in neonates and infants.
Statistically significant difference was not observed during comparison of demographic data of patients.
Differences in groups were found in statistical analysis of intra- and postoperative parameters (p<0.05).
Mean duration of surgery in the first group was 37.29 min, in the second group - 23.97 min. Time to start of feeding and transition to complete enteral nutrition was less in patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery than after open intervention (10.5 and 19.13 hours, 23.79 and 35.88 hours respectively; p<0.05).
It was revealed augmentation of hospital stay in the 1st group in comparison with the 2(nd) group (11.71 and 7.09 days respectively; p<0.05).
Frequency of postoperative complications was 18.33% in the 2(nd) group and 24% - in the 1st group (p<0.05).
The authors consider that button devices are simply and effective technique of gastrostomy establishment in children.  It is associated with minimal surgery duration and allows to start early enteral nutrition in comparison with open techniques.
