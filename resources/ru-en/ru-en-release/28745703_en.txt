To present an experience of surgical treatment of hiatal hernia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
An experience of more than thousand laparoscopic fundoplications in various modifications has been accumulated in the Clinic of Bashkir State Medical University for the period 2001-2016.
RESULTS  An original device for intraoperative measurement of hiatal orifice is described.
Hiatal orifice repair was indicated in case of its dimension over 3.5 cm. 310 patients underwent hiatal orifice repair including diaphragmocrurorrhaphy in 189 cases, hiatal orifice replacement by using of mesh implant in 121 cases.  Simultaneous interventions were performed in 211 cases due to hiatal hernia combined with other abdominal diseases.
CONCLUSION  Thus, selection of hiatal hernia patients for antireflux surgery should be clearly indicated according to clinical and instrumental data in the context of health care system reforming and widespread use of minimally invasive technologies.
Laparoscopic operations for hiatal hernia are preferable and contribute to decrease of morbidity and improvement of outcomes.
