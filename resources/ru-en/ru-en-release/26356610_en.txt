[The clinical picture of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis in children].  OBJECTIVE
to study clinical presentations of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (NCS) in children.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors analyzed 56 cases of different forms of NCS.  To verify the diagnosis, all children underwent computed tomography with 3D cranial reconstruction.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The distribution of diagnoses was as follows: scaphocephaly - 28 (50%) patients, trigonocephaly - 21 (38%), different forms of plagiocephaly - 7 (12%).
On admission to the hospital, 25 (43%) patients were diagnosed with perinatal CNS damage, 10 (18%) were born premature, 33 (59%) had neurological deviations.
The clinical picture of NCS was polymorphic that might explain an increase in the number of children with late-diagnosed craniosynostosis.
The early diagnosis of NCS which is the basis for using less invasive surgical methods is particularly important for prognosis.
