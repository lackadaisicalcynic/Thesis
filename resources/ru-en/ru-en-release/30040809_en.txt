[Modern views on gait impairment in Parkinson`s disease and its correction].  The article reviews the causes of gait impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
The emphasis is made on modern ideas, according to which gait impairment in PD is caused by a multisystem lesion and non-dopaminergic dependent mechanisms play the leading role.
It is highlighted that gait impairment in PD is associated with the disruption of frontal/subcortical neural pathways which requires a special approach to pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy.
Based on pathogenetic mechanisms, much attention is paid to anti-dementia medications.  Attention is drawn to the fact that the use of memantine hydrochloride (akatinol memantine) is a promising direction for gait impairment correction in the advanced and late stages of PD due to the improvement of glutamatergic transfer from the striatum to the specific areas of the cerebral cortex involved in gait control.
The results of the latest clinical trials are analyzed.
