[Corneal collagen cross-linking for keratoconus].
Over the last decade, corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) has become a conventional treatment method for progressive keratoconus.
Laboratory studies have shown that CXL increases the diameter of collagen fibers and also the number of intra- and interfibrillar cross-links, thus, increasing biomechanical strength of the irradiated cornea.
As confirmed by a series of clinical and randomized controlled trials, CXL is able to slow down and, perhaps, to stop the progression of keratoconus.  In most post-CXL patients visual acuity improves, while keratometric readings, spherical equivalent, and higher order aberrations reduce.
Although published results prove CXL effective in the treatment of progressive keratoconus, its late consequences are yet unknown.  This article reviews the stages of CXL development and results of published experimental and clinical studies.
Prospects for CXL modifications that do not require epithelial debridement are discussed.
