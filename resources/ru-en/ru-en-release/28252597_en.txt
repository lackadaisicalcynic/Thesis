[«Verschroben»-phenomenon in schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders: aspects of systematics].
AIM
Psychopathological analysis and typological differentiation of «verschroben»-phenomenon as the full-blown syndrome of defect in schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty patients, 33 female and 17 male, mean age 44.8±8.5 years, with ICD-10 diagnosis of schizotypal disorder (F21) and residual schizophrenia (F20.5) were included in the study.  Patients were examined using psychopathological and psychometric (SPQ-74) methods.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
There was clinical heterogeneity of the «verschroben» type defect: the differentiation of primary defect syndrome and the «second life» defect was confirmed.
This typological classification is based not only on the differences in psychopathological symptoms and impaired social functioning but on the trajectory of the development of deficit syndromes related with the features of the course of endogenous disease.
The typology would be useful for future studies of deficit changes in view of clinical prognosis, social context of schizophrenia spectrum disorders with negative «verschroben» type changes.
