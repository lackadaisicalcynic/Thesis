[Clinical and morphological characteristics of parathyroid carcinoma].  Parathyroid carcinoma (PTC) is a rare malignant tumor with the clinical manifestation of hyperparathyroidism, reliable morphological signs of invasive growth, and poor clinical prognosis.
The differential diagnosis of PTC due to the rarity of this pathology, not always explicit morphological criteria, and the lack of a certain immunohistochemical panel is complex and needs further clarification.
The paper summarizes an update on the clinical and morphological characteristics of PTC.
