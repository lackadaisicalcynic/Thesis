[Age-related changes of sensory peripheral nerve system in healthy subjects.]  Our aim was to present and evaluate age-related changes of peripheral nerves of limbs on a huge population of healthy subjects of different ages.
In 2009-2016 subjects aged from 1months to 90 years were studied by nerve conduction velocity studies (NCV).
Data of those confirmed healthy was included in our study.  In total there were 372 healthy subjects.
NCV for nn.
Medianus et Ulnaris was registered, with NCV and amplitude of compound sensory action potential (CSAP) being analyzed.
There were significant differences on both these parameters between different age groups.  Since the childhood the improvement of conduction (which was reflected in rising of CSAP amplitudes and NCV quickening) was registered; from 40-50 years steady decline of both these parameters were observed in both nerves.
Conduction studies of peripheral nerves may be implemented in gerontology for early detection of neurophysiology patterns reflecting physiological aging.
Also our results may be implemented for accelerated aging detection.
