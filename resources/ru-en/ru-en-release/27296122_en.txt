[Endosurgery of benign diseases and injuries of esophagus].
AIM  To analyze the results of endoscopic interventions for benign diseases and injuries of the esophagus.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
159 patients with benign diseases and perforation of the esophagus were operated.
There were 72 (45.3%) cases of achalasia, 56 (35.2%) with post-ambustial stenosis of esophagus, 14 (8.8%) with esophageal perforation, 13 (8.2%) with leuomyoma of esophagus and 4 (2.5%) with diverticulum of thoracic esophagus.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In long-term period 56 patients with achalasia were followed-up after laparoscopic Heller cardiomyotomy with Dor fundoplication.  Good results were observed in all cases.
Three patients died in early postoperative period after thoracoscopic extirpation of esophagus with esophagoplasty via laparotomy at the stage of development of the technique.
There were no deaths after thoracoscopic extirpation of esophagus with simultaneous laparoscopic gastroplasty.  Postoperative period was significantly less after thoracoscopic extirpation of esophagus with simultaneous laparoscopic esophagogastroplasty using whole stomach compared with esophagogastroplasty and esophagocoloplasty via laparotomy.
In long-term postoperative period different complications occurred in 17 cases.
Two patients with esophageal perforation died after video-assisted laparotranshiatal drainage of posterior mediastinum.  Scarring of esophageal defect was observed in others.
Seam failure after esophageal leuomyoma removal was diagnosed in 2 patients that required video-assisted laparotranshiatal drainage of posterior mediastinum and Maydl jejunostomy.
Seam failure in thoracic esophagus after thoracoscopic removal of diverticulum was observed in 1 case.
The complication was cured by video-assisted laparotranshiatal drainage of posterior mediastinum.
