[Ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome: What is common in their diagnosis and treatment?].
Complications of cirrhosis are a main cause of death in the immediate and late follow-up periods in these patients.  Portal hypertension, edematous-ascitic syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy are poor predictors.
The sociomedical importance of these complications is obvious for reasons of the high risk of death in these patients in the immediate period (15-30 days).
This review represents a set of practical algorithms whose basis is the most effective methods to diagnose, treat, and prevent complications of cirrhosis.
