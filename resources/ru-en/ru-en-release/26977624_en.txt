[The efficacy of remaxol addition in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome].  OBJECTIVE
To study the efficacy of remaxol addition in the treatment scheme of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Eighty patients with alcohol dependence and physical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome were enrolled.
All patients received basic therapy in accordance to the applicable standards of treatment.  The patients were randomized to remaxol introduced intravenously 2 times a day (morning and afternoon) in dose of 400 ml for 7 days (n=40) and saline with 25%-magnesium sulfate (10 ml) and 4% potassium chloride (10 ml) (n=40).
RESULTS  The effectiveness of the inclusion of remaxol was expressed in a more rapid relief of asthenic syndrome, reduction of phenomena such as tension, dysphoria, headache and impaired coordination of samples.
Patients treated with remaxol demonstrated a trend towards a more rapid reduction of the affective (p=0.08) and behavioral components (p=0.09) of the syndrome of pathological craving for alcohol.  Hepatoprotective and detoxification properties of the drug were confirmed by the significant decline in ALT and AST activity to the 20th day of treatment.
Significant positive changes in lipid metabolism (HDL to the 7th day of treatment) and a normalizing effect on the processes of tissue respiration were shown as well.
No adverse effects were noted.
CONCLUSION  The data obtained allow to recommend the inclusion of remaxol in the complex treatment regimens of alcohol withdrawal syndrome to improve the treatment efficacy.
