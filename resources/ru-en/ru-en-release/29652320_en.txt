[Bronchial fistula management.  Is the exit found?]
To present treatment of bronchial fistulas by using of occluders.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period from March 2015 to October 2016 Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) occluders have been used for bronchial fistulas occlusion (Lepu Medical Technology Co., Ltd.; Lifetech Scientific Co., Ltd.).  These are devices designed to close ventricular and atrial septal defects.
The procedure was performed in 8 patients with main bronchus fistula occurred after pulmonectomy for tuberculosis in 5 patients and lung cancer in 3 patients.
Fistulas' dimensions were 6-26 mm.
The procedure was performed with double visualization from pleural cavity (through the thoracostomy and port-assisted approach) and from bronchial lumen.
RESULTS
Seven out of 8 patients are currently alive (1 patient died from advanced tuberculosis of single lung).
Occlusion is adequate in 6 patients, air drainage around around the occluder is noted in 1 patient.
In 1 patient esophageal-pleural fistula occurred besides bronchial fistula.
There was significant 2-3-fold decrease of residual pleural cavities volume and output volume.
Patients feel satisfactory.
