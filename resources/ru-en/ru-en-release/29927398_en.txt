[Cognitive impairment in patients with metabolic syndrome.  The current treatment possibilities].
AIM
To study the effect of therapy with cytoflavin on cognitive function in patients with metabolic syndrome (MS).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The randomized controlled open study included 156 patients with MS.  The mean age was 41.27±5.16 years.
The duration of observation was 16 weeks.  The main group of patients (n=78) received cytoflavin in the dose of 2 tablets 2 times a day.
Patients in the control group (n=78) received basic therapy.  All patients underwent neuropsychological testing at baseline, after 2 months and at the end of the study.
Cognitive evoked potentials (Р300) were recorded to assess cognitive functions.
The levels of plasma glucose and lipid profile were measured.
RESULTS  Cytoflavin improved cognitive functions.
Two months after treatment, the results of neuropsychological testing and electrophysiological study were better in the main group compared to the control group.
