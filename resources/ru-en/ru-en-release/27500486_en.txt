[Demonstration of the impossibility of simultaneous Dupuytren and Destot fractures in the result of the car-pedestrian collision].  This article reports the results of the commission forensic medical expertise undertaken to evaluate the possibility of severe injury to the ankle joint resulting from the road traffic accident as exemplified by the collision of a VAS 21043 car moving backward with a pedestrian.
It was shown that the injury to the victim's right lower leg included the tear of the right crural deltoid ligament, the open communicated fracture of the lower third of fibular diaphysis with the displacement of the distal fragment, the lacerated wound in the lower third of the right leg, the rupture of distal tibiofibular synedesmosis, the closed communicated fracture of the posterior edge of the tibia without displacement, and outward subluxation of the right foot.
According to the classification accepted in orthopedics , this variant of the injury to the ankle joint is a combination of the classical «complete» Dupuytren fracture and the Destot-type fracture.
The analysis of the mechanism underlying formation of such injury has shown that it was a consequence of the indirect injurious action in the absence of the primary impact without the car running over the victim's leg.
