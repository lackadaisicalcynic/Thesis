[Surgical Site Infections after Open Appendectomy and Effectiveness of Complex Approach to Their Prevention].
AIM
To assess an incidence rate of surgical site infections (SSI) after open appendectomy and effectiveness of combined preventive measures (CPM).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
This study was performed at three surgical departments of Smolensk hospitals.  A total of 150 consecutive patients (50 at each department) hospitalized since January 2012 were included into the retrospective observation (period I).
In order to perform prospective evaluation of CPM, a total of 66 consecutive patients (randomized 1:1) hospitalized since December 2012 (period II) were followed up at each of the departments.
Antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) with IV amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.2 g) was planned for all patients from period II.
The study group (group 1) included patients with surgical wound closure with triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 and additionally with a skin 2-octylcyanoacrylate-based adhesive.
The control group (group 2) included patients with surgical wound closure with non-triclosan-coated polyglactin 910.  Each patient from the period II was assigned to an "Individual SSI Prevention Package" (IPP), which included an antibiotic, sutures, skin adhesive (only in a package for CPM) and label "AP" for patients' medical records.
Patients' medical records were reviewed by one expert.
Exclusion criteria were: age <14 years; transition to midline laparotomy; drainage of the abdominal cavity through the surgical wound; simultaneous interventions; secondary appendicitis; refusal to use of sutures from the IPP.  In order to determine signs of SSI presence/absence within 30 days after surgery, attempts to contact with patients by phone were made.
The data obtained was recorded into case report forms and then entered into the study database.
RESULTS
A total of 322 patients were included into the final analysis (mean age: 34.8±17.1 years).
The mean length of hospital stay was 8.2±2.5 days.
The mean duration of hospital stay with or without SSI was 7.9±1.8 and 14.2±4.0 days, respectively (p<0.001).
The AP during the periods I and II was performed in 56.1% (83/148) and 97.7% (170/174) of patients, respectively (p<0.00001).
Cephalosporins I-IV were the most frequently used antibiotics during the period I (85.6%).
During the period II, amoxicillin/clavulanate from IPP was used in 98.2% of patients.
Percentage of IV antibiotic administration in different time periods was 57.3% and 98.2%, respectively (p<0.0001); frequency of the first administration before skin incision was 53.6% and 97.1%, respectively (p<0.0001).
The telephone contact with patient was successful in 74.8% (both periods), 56.8% (period I) and 90.2% (period II) of cases, respectively.
SSI was recorded only once per patient with the following priority: SSI was documented in the patient's medical record; patient developed SSI that was not documented (in the expert's opinion) in the patient's medical record; SSI signs were determined during the telephone contact or reported by the patient.
The incidence of SSI in both study periods, period I and period II was 14.9%, 15.5% and 14.4%, respectively (p>0.05 for all comparisons).
In the patient subgroup with successful telephone contact, the incidence of SSI in both study periods, period I and period II was 17.4%, 21.4% and 15.3%, respectively; the incidence of SSI in group 1 and group 2 of the period II was 12.0% and 18.9%, respectively (p>0.05 for all comparisons).
CONCLUSION
SSI after an open appendectomy remains an important problem.  In order to determine a true incidence of SSI, it is necessary to improve the national nosocomial infection surveillance system.
The CMP used in the study have showed a trend to significant SSI risk reduction and may be recommended to maximize patient protection.
Further large studies are needed to confirm effectiveness of the proposed CMP.
