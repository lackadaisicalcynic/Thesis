[Indications for surgical treatment of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas].
Prolactinomas account for about 40% of all pituitary adenomas.
The main treatment for prolactinomas is undoubtedly therapy with dopamine agonists (DAs).  However, prolonged conservative treatment (for many years or even throughout life) that is necessary for permanent control of the disease makes some patients refuse pharmacological treatment for various reasons.
In addition, not all prolactinomas respond to DAs therapy.
Sometimes, the patient is not able to continue treatment because of the severity of side effects.
Along with tumor resistance to therapy and patient intolerance of DAs, complications (liquorrhea, hemorrhage in the tumor) may occur during conservative treatment.
In these cases, surgery is necessary.
The paper analyzes the modern literature on various treatment options for prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas and defines the indications for surgical treatment.
