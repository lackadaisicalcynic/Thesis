[Discontinuity of the annuity curves.  I. Departures from Gompertz law in Drosophila melanogaster Canton-S strain].
Analysis of male imago mortality in Drosophila melanogaster Canton-S strain demonstrated deviation from Gompertz law.  Annuity curves were composed of five phases divided by sharp bends.
All the phases seemed to be linear.
We discuss the hypotheses of strict genetic determination of the phenomenon.
