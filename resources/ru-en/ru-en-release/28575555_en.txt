[Description of aging dogs and fruit flies based on the kinetic theory].  The aim of the study is to assess the adequacy of model representations, accepted in the kinetic theory of aging of living systems, the analysis of the experimental data obtained on dogs and fruit flies.
The work is illustrated by applying the need to develop a mathematical model of the kinetic theory of aging to describe the probability density of death, probability of death, the average duration of life of the considered biological systems in the natural conditions of existence, as well as for dogs with limited time and chronic RA-diciannove impact, and for Drosophila - high external temperature.
Op-defined kinetic equation of aging and their parameters.
