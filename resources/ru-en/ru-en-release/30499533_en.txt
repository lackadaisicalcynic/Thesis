[New biophotonics methods for improving efficiency and safety of laser modification of the fibrous tunic of the eye].  The article describes a newly developed and tested diffractive optical element (DOE) that converts non-uniform radiation of the laser output into a homogeneous ring.
The Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm is shown to be well suited for achieving annular intensity distribution.
Testing this ring transducer on threshold-plasticity cornea demonstrated the reversibility of axisymmetric changes in the cornea.  Atomic-Force microscopy of the area of maximum stresses in the corneal periphery showed no significant changes in the structure of the cornea when irradiated in the selected mode.
Measurement of Young's modulus of the corneal surface areas after their irradiation also revealed no changes in the elastic properties, while examination of the corneal structure demonstrated the absence of significant structural changes in irradiated samples compared with intact ones.
