[Complications and long-term results of delayed esophagoezophagostomy for esophageal atresia].
AIM  To evaluate complications and long-term results of delayed esophagoesophagostomy in children with esophageal atresia (EA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
165 EA children were operated at the Filatov Municipal Children's Hospital #13 for the period 2006-2016.
Primary esophageal anastomosis was performed in 136 (82.4%) children with tracheoesophageal fistula.
In 5 (3%) neonates with non-fistulous EA esophago- and gastrostomy were made for further coloesophagoplasty.
Other 24 (14.5%) children underwent gastrostomy for delayed esophagoesophagostomy.
6 (25%) of them died within 12 days after admission.
18 survivors with gastrostomy subsequently underwent delayed esophagoesophagostomy.
RESULTS
Postoperative complications occurred in 16 (88.9%) children.
Esophageal anastomosis failure occurred in 4 (22.2%) patients, stenosis of anastomosis in 11 (61.1%) children, gastroesophageal reflux in 14 (77.8%) children.
Early postoperative mortality was 16.7% (3 children).
In remote period 92.3% of children were not adapted to normal diet and only in 7.7% of patients eating behavior corresponds to the age.
11 children underwent prolonged esophageal bougienage.
9 children underwent re-operation after delayed anastomosis.
Esophageal extirpation was made in 4 children.
CONCLUSION
Esophago- and gastrostomy provides 100% survival if primary esophageal anastomosis is impossible.
Herewith, in children without esophagostomy mortality rate was 25%.  We still can not confirm that delayed esophageal anastomosis is a good alternative for children with esophageal atresia.
In view of our results the number of candidates for delayed esophageal anastomosis should be reduced.
