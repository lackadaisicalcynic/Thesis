[Visual perception of dentition esthetic parameters (part 2)].  The study on impact of dentition aesthetic parameters as the length of the teeth at the incisal edge, the length of the teeth at the gingival margin, the width of the teeth, shape and brightness of the teeth on visual perception was carried out by comparison of objective assessment data with subjective assessment of the respondents.
All revealed correlations were linear and could be described by linear regression equations.
A similar method can be used for objective quantitative assessment of smile aesthetics before and after dental treatment.
