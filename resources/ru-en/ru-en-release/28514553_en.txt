[Significance of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and chronic heart failure in elderly hypertensive patients].
To determine the pathogenic role of insulin resistance in the formation of involutive sarcopenia and chronic heart failure (CHF) were examined 88 elderly patients with arterial hypertension (AH) and 32 elderly patients without cardiovascular disease by methods of carbohydrate metabolism and the level of brain natriuretic peptide precursor evaluation, muscle mass and strength measuring, echocardiography, 6 minute walking test.
It was found that in the group of hypertensive patients with low mass and muscle strength significantly increased indices of insulin resistance and more expressed signs of the left ventricle myocardial dysfunction and functional class of heart failure, probably as a result of disorders of energy homeostasis, resulting from the deterioration of glucose into the muscle cells of the heart and skeletal muscles.
