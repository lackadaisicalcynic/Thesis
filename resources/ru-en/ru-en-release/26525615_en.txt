[Efficacy of cytoflavin in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic lesions of the nervous system in 1-month old children with transient neonatal hypothyroidism].
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the efficacy of cytoflavin in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic lesions of the nervous system in young infants with transient neonatal hypothyroidism.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors analyzed the efficacy of cytoflavin in the treatment of cerebral ischemia in the combination with transient neonatal hypothyroidism in 89 newborns.  The main group comprised 43 children treated with intravenous cytoflavin in dose 2 ml per 1 kg of body weight per day for five days; 46 newborns of the comparison group received basic therapy.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
It was found that the moderate depression of motor activity and autonomic-visceral dysfunctions were the leading clinical neurological manifestations in these groups.
In the main group, there was a significantly more rapid decline of hyperthyreotropinemia, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, reduced severity of cerebral ischemia by the results of neurosonography on the 5th or 6th day and regression of the main clinical symptoms compared to the control group.  The positive neuroprotective and thyroid protective effect of cytoflavin, good tolerability and its compatibility with other drugs used in the standard treatment of hypoxic-ischemic lesions of the central nervous system were identified.
