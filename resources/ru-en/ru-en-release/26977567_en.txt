[The application of mastoidoplasty in repeated scanning operations on the ear].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the outcomes of mastoid obliteration with the use of the orthotopic bone tissue taken from the linea temporalis region.
It was shown that this region is the optimal site at the temporal bone for the harvesting of the plastic bone material to be used in mastoidoplasty during secondary sanitizing surgical interventions on the patients with mastoid cavity problems after canal wall-down mastoidrctomy under conditions of the deficiency of the orthotopic bone tissue.
The application of such tissue for the purpose of mastoid-obliteration surgery provides a number of advantages over other methods of mastoidoplasty, in the first place from the standpoint of tissue biocompatibility.
Multispiral computed tomography (MSCT) of the temporal bones is a highly informative and non-invasive technique for the study and control of the patients' condition during the late postoperative period following a secondary sanitizing surgical intervention involving mastoidoplasty with the application of the orthotopic bone tissue.
