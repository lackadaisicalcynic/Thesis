[A technique of manufacturing anatomical preparations of the human brain based on injecting vessels with colored silicone (a technical note)].  OBJECTIVE
The objective was to produce anatomical preparations by injecting vessels with colored silicone to study the brain and skull base anatomy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fresh, undissected, and unfixed cadavers were used.  The internal carotid arteries and internal jugular veins were identified on both sides of the neck.
The vessels were washed with running water.
Then, a complex solution consisting of white silicone rubber, silicone oil (solvent), and a coloring pigment (red and blue pigments) at a ratio of 1:(0.9-1.1):(0.04-0.06), respectively, was prepared.
About 30-60 s before injecting the complex solution into the vessels, a catalyst-hardener was added to the solution at a ratio of 1:(0.05-0.07).
The complex solution was first introduced into the internal carotid artery until the solution came out from the contralateral internal carotid artery; then, the solution was injected into the internal jugular vein until the solution emerged from the contralateral internal jugular vein.
RESULTS
The technique enables quick and high-quality visualization of both large and very small vessels of the brain and skull base.
CONCLUSION
The proposed simple and inexpensive technique of manufacturing anatomical preparations improves the quality of training and mastering of microsurgical skills in residents and practicing neurosurgeons.
