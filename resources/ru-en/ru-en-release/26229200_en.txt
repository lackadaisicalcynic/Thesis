The healthy food environment policy index: findings of an expert panel in New Zealand.
OBJECTIVE  To assess government actions to improve the healthiness of food environments in New Zealand, based on the healthy food environment policy index.
METHODS
A panel of 52 public health experts rated the extent of government implementation against international best practice for 42 indicators of food environment policy and infrastructure support.  Their ratings were informed by documented evidence, validated by government officials and international benchmarks.
FINDINGS  There was a high level of implementation for some indicators: providing ingredient lists and nutrient declarations and regulating health claims on packaged foods; transparency in policy development; monitoring prevalence of noncommunicable diseases and monitoring risk factors for noncommunicable diseases.
There was very little, if any implementation of the following indicators: restrictions on unhealthy food marketing to children; fiscal and food retail policies and protection of national food environments within trade agreements.
Interrater reliability was 0.78 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.76-0.79).  Based on the implementation gaps, the experts recommended 34 actions, and prioritized seven of these.
CONCLUSION  The healthy food environment policy index provides a useful set of indicators that can focus attention on where government action is needed.
It is anticipated that this policy index will increase accountability of governments, stimulate government action and support civil society advocacy efforts.
