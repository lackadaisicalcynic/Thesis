[The efficacy of botulinum toxin therapy in patients with upper limb spasticity due to traumatic brain injury].
Spasticity is a type of muscle hyperactivity that occurs in patients after focal lesions of the Central nervous system due to various diseases: stroke, traumatic brain injury or spinal cord injury, neurosurgical intervention, as well as multiple sclerosis and other diseases of the Central nervous system and is the most disability manifestation of the syndrome of upper motor neuron (UMNS).  Focal spasticity of the upper limb requires a complex treatment.
Botulinum toxin therapy is an effective treatment for focal/multifocal spasticity in reducing muscle tone and improving function with the highest level of evidence according to the latest American and European guidelines for treatment of spasticity.  There are many publications devoted to BTA use in post-stroke patients.
This article provides a review of the BTA use in patients with the upper limb spasticity due to severe traumatic brain injury.  Some local data on the BTA efficacy in the cohort of patients with traumatic brain injury are also presented.
