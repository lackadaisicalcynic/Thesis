[Rate of visual recovery after macular hole surgery with intraoperative optical coherence tomography and visualization of the internal limiting membrane].  Currently, multiple techniques exist to repair a macular hole, but the functional result may be largely affected by the use of dyes during surgery.
With our original visualization methods, one is able to remove the internal limiting membrane (ILM) without staining, and thus to avoid the toxic effect of dyes.
AIM  to compare anatomical and functional results of surgical closure of large macular holes with or without ILM staining.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 160 patients (190 eyes) were divided into 2 groups.
Patients from group 1 (60 eyes) were subjected to surgery that involved the use of a dye, while in group 2 (130 eyes) ILM was not performed.
Anatomical and functional results of the two groups were then compared.
RESULTS
The next day after surgery, a large improvement in the best corrected visual acuity - of 3 lines or more - was found in 28 controls (46.6%) and 98 patients from the main group (75.4%).
There was no significant change in 24 and 27 patients, respectively (40.0% and 20.7%).
The remaining 8 and 5 patients (13.4% and 3.9%) deteriorated by 3 lines or more.
CONCLUSION
Stain-free removal of the ILM under green-yellow light favours rapid recovery of visual acuity in patients with macular holes.
Anatomical reconstruction of the foveola, including complete approximation of the hole margins and keeping the defect closed until the end of the operation, is controlled through a built-in optical coherence tomograph ensuring high anatomical and functional results.
