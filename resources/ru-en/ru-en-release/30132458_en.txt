[The influence of adenosine receptor ligands and hypoxic preconditioning on the metabolism of the brain tissue in the experiment].  AIM
To study the influence of adenosine receptor ligands and hypoxic preconditioning on carbohydrate metabolism in global brain ischemia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 51 outbred white male mice weighing 20-25 g.
An effect of adenosine receptor ligands and hypoxic preconditioning on brain tissue metabolism, heat exchange and longevity was explored.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Adenosine, an agonist of A1 adenosine receptors, and hypoxic preconditioning exert a neuroprotective effect on brain cells.
The blocker of A1 adenosine receptors aggravates metabolic disturbances in the brain and removes the protective effect of cyclopenyladenosine and ischemic preconditioning.
