[Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy combined with cytoreductive procedure in patients with peritoneal pseudomyxoma].  AIM
To study the results of intraperitoneal chemoperfusion combined with cytoreductive procedure in patients with peritoneal pseudomyxoma.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period 2006--2015 seven patients with peritoneal pseudomyxoma underwent aggressive treatment using hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion combined with cytoreductive procedure at the Department of General Oncology of N.N. Petrov Research Institute of Oncology.  RESULTS
Two patients had postoperative complications.  One of them died after 12 days postoperatively.
Features of postoperative complications were predominantly determined by volume of cytoreduction.
Advanced tumoral process caused death in 2 patients additionally.
Other patients are still alive during 4--28 months after surgery.
CONCLUSION
Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion combined with cytoreductive procedure is advisable for peritoneal pseudomyxoma to improve survival.  Optimal cytoreduction should be developed in researches with large number of patients to decrease incidence of complications.
