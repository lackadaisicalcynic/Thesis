[Tuberculous lesion of retropharyngeal lymph nodes responsible for labored nasal breathing].  A 62 year-old patient applied for the medical aid with complaints of labored nasal breathing.
She was treated for tuberculosis in the childhood, underwent radical mastectomy in connection with left breast cancer in 2007 and adenotomy at the age of 60 years with the good functional outcome.
One year after adenotomy, the enlargement of lymph nodes at the left-hand antero-lateral surface of the neck was detected.
The histological changes in the lymph nodes corresponded to the picture of tuberculosis.
Pharyngoscopy demonstrated an asymmetric protrusion at the posterior wall of the pharynx more prominent on the left side.  Examination by spiral computed tomography revealed the presence of two enlarged lymph nodes with the signs of suppurative melting in the retropharyngeal space.
These lymph nodes were opened through the posterior pharyngeal wall which resulted in the restoration of the normal pharynx configuration and the normalization of nasal breathing.
