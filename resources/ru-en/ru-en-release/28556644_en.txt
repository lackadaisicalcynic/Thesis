[Characteristics of inflammatory response in patients after senile cataract surgery].
The aim of the work was to study prognostic value of some laboratory markers (anti-DNA antibodies, cell adhesive molecules, neopterin) in heriatric patients with exudative inflammation after cataract surgery.
12 in-patients with postoperative iridocyclitis and endophthalmitis were included.
The assays were taken twice: after admission and before discharging.
The follow-up period was 6 months.  Preliminary data show that high serum levels of sVCAM, sICAM and anti-DNA antibodies, as well as very low levels of anti-DNA antibodies seems to be associated with poor outcomes in those patients (enucleation, blindness, lens extraction).
Small cohort doesnot allow us to make strict conclusion about prognostic value of these laboratory markers.  The study should be continued.
