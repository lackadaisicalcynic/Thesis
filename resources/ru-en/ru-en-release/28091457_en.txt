[Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in short-stay hospital].
AIM
To develop the protocol of surgical management of cholelithiasis in short-stay hospital.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Surgical treatment of 161 patients with cholelithiasis was analyzed.
All of them underwent elective cholecystectomy.
Short-stay hospital group included 41 patients. 120 patients were operated in surgical department (group 2).
RESULTS
Incidence of intraoperative complications was 2.4% and 3.4% in both groups respectively (p>0.05).
Postoperative complications were more frequent in group 2 (8.3% vs. 2.4%, p<0.05).
Mean hospital-stay was 1 and 4.4 days in both groups respectively.
CONCLUSION
Treatment of chronic calculous cholecystitis is advisable in short-stay hospital.
Indications for this approach and its safety in certain patients were determined.  The protocol of surgical management of chronic cholecystitis in short-stay hospital was develped.
