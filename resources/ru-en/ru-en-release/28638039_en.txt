[Headache immunology].  The overview is dedicated to the neuroimmunological mechanisms of headache development and chronification.
Based on the analyzed data, the authors determined the relationship between immunological parameters and duration, intensity and other characteristics of this disease.
These findings confirm that immunocompetent cells can be used as headache biomarkers and predictors of treatment efficacy.
Questions about the role of separate parts of the immune system in the development and maintenance of a headache require further research.  Studies of humoral immunity appeared to be very promising.
