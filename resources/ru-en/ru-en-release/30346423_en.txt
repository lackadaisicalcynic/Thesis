[Clinical features and treatment of patients with class III malocclusion combined with and increase and lengthening of the nose].  The aim of the study was to study the effect of orthognathic surgery using the developed method of correction of dentoalveolar anomalies on the shape of the nose in patients with Class III tooth-jaw anomalies, according to Engle's classification, combined with an increase and lengthening of the nose.
In the period from 2014-2017 on the basis of FGBBO VO 'PIMU' of the Ministry of Health of Russia treated 45 patients with maxillofacial anomalies, among them 31 people diagnosed with upper retro microburnia, lower macrognathia, Engle III class, skeletal type.
All patients were between the ages of 21 and 45, without severe co-morbidities.
We evaluated the nasolabial angle (ÐCm-Sn-UL) characterizing the projection of the tip of the nose in patients with a skeletal form of mesial occlusion and an increase and extension of the tip of the nose before and after surgical treatment.
According to the data of various authors, the value of the nasolabial angle in the norm varies from 97 to 110°.
The mean nasolabial angle before the operation was 83.52±2.02°, which is much less than the recommended value, which indicates a pronounced elongation and 'droop' of the tip of the nose.
The average value after the operation was 94, 90±1.88°, which on the average is 11° more than the initial data.
These data indicate a change in the projection of the tip of the nose and an increase in the angle of Sm-Sn-UL, thereby improving the appearance of the patient.
