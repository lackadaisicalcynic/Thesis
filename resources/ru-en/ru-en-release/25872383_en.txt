[Comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of various treatment modalities for accommodation disorders and acquired progressive myopia].
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the effectiveness of non-surgical treatment of accommodation disorders and progressive myopia in children.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 190 patients (380 eyes) with myopia aged from 6 to 18 years (10.79Â±0.18 years on average) were enrolled and divided into 9 groups depending on the treatment prescribed.
RESULTS
Comparative evaluation of different hardware-based treatment modalities for progressive myopia allowed to work out their optimal combination: "Visotronic", "MACDEL 09", and magnetophoresis of Taufon 4%.
Such courses, provided twice a year, were associated with optimization of accommodative response and 1.9-2.8 times reduction of the rate of myopia progression.
On the contrary, pleoptic therapy showed a negative effect on accommodative tonus and the rate of progression of acquired myopia.
CONCLUSIONS
Comparative evaluation of different hardware-based treatment modalities for progressive myopia and accommodation disorders allowed to work out their optimal combination: "Visotronic", "MACDEL 09" and magnetophoresis of Taufon 4%.
This treatment, provided twice a year, allows to increase accommodative reserves and volume, improve objective accommodative response, and reduce accommodative hypertonus as well as the rate of myopia progression (1.9-2.8 times over a 1.5-year period).
Under pleoptic therapy (specialized software, near field speckles, color pulse therapy, Ambliokor device), both accommodative tonus and the rate of myopia progression increased (1.3-1.5 and 1.6 times correspondingly).
