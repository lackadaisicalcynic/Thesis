[Early orthodontic treatment of the patients with Class III malocclusion combined with the arches discrepancies using the own design appliance.  Clinical case].
A 6-year-old boy with a skeletal Class III malocclusion was treated with the use of the fixed own design orthodontic appliance.  The device includes acrylic-splint with a three-sided (Bertoni) screw mounted in them, an arc element in the region of the front teeth for protractive action on them, metal hooks for the face mask.
Orthodontic treatment using that appliance allowed to normalize the upper dental arche in the sagittal and transversal directions.  Thus, conditions for normal growth and development of the dentofacial complex were created, which is the main goal of early orthodontic intervention.
