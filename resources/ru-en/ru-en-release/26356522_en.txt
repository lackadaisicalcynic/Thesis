[Parameters of electroneuromyography of lower extremities and densitometry in osteochondrosis of lumbar spine].  AIM
To study the density of bone tissue and parameters of electroneuromyography (ENMG) in patients with osteochondrosis of lumbar spine.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Authors examined 67 patients, mean age 41 years, diagnosed with unilateral lumbar ischialgia syndrome.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The changes in the density of bone tissue (osteopenia and osteoporosis) and marked disturbances of neuromuscular apparatus function were found in 79% of the patients.  This finding suggests the relationship between the ENMG and densitometry parameters.
