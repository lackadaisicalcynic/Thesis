AIM
To present an experience of intraoperative manufacture of the valved conduit in aortic root surgery in the Department of Cardiac Surgery of Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
In our department aortic valve and ascending aortic replacement using intraoperatively manufactured valved conduit was performed in 11 patients for the period 2012-2016.  Technical aspects, choice of vascular prosthesis size and type of fixation to achieve optimal hemodynamics and adequate impermeability of stitches are described.
RESULTS
Intraoperative manufacture of the valved conduit is successfully reproducible technique with good early and remote results.
