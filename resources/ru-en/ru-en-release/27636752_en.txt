[Classification of local anesthesia methods].  The traditional classification methods of dental local anesthesia must be modified.
In this paper we proved that the vascular mechanism is leading component of spongy injection.
It is necessary to take into account the high effectiveness and relative safety of spongy anesthesia, as well as versatility, ease of implementation and the growing prevalence in the world.
The essence of the proposed modification is to distinguish the methods in diffusive (including surface anesthesia, infiltration and conductive anesthesia) and vascular-diffusive (including intraosseous, intraligamentary, intraseptal and intrapulpal anesthesia).
For the last four methods the common term «spongy (intraosseous) anesthesia» may be used.
