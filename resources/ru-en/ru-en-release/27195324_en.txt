[Preclinical and clinical trials of the new tuberculosis drug perchlozon].  The paper sets forth the stages of design and introduction of the new Russian tuberculosis (TB) drug perchlozon registered in the Russian Federation in 2012.
Based on the results of Phases I-III clinical trials, the authors evaluate the efficacy and safety of the agent and consider the adverse effects of its treatment for respiratory TB.  The use of perchlozon as a component of combination therapy versus standard chemotherapy regimens significantly reduces abacillation time in pulmonary TB caused by its drug-resistant pathogen.
In terms of the higher prevalence of TB induced by its pathogen resistant to many drugs (with multiple and broad-spectrum drug resistance), perchlozon is an essential drug that has antituberculous activity mainly against multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and gives patients with the severest and epidemiologically poor form of TB the chance to recover.
