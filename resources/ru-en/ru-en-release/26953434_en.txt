[Serial clinical examinations as the main approach to dental caries prevention in children].  Leading scientific and organizational prerequisites for the feasibility of clinical examination of the entire child population of the Russian Federation to the dentist is, above all, the high prevalence and intensity of dental diseases in children of all ages.
As a result of many years of research and follow-up of children of preschool and school age we have proved the need to distinguish a group of children with zero activity of dental caries.  The referring criteria are determined according to the results of comprehensive clinical and laboratory examination in order to determine the degree of risk of dental caries and individual caries resistance.
The age-specific risk group is settled by "Stop caries" software.  In order to optimize the preventive activities children are divided in 5 groups for routine preventive dental care.
Unfortunately the efforts of modern dental services aimed at eliminating the consequences of caries process by filling cavities.  Individualized preventive approach will increase the effectiveness of preventive measures and save public funds allocated in the amount of compulsory health insurance for pediatric dentistry.
