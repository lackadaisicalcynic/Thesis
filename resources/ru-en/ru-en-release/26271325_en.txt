[The state of cytokine status in patients with mechanical jaundice of benign origin].
The results of survey of 67 patients with obstructive jaundice (OJ) of benign origin are analyzedin the article.
In all patients the cause of obstructive jaundice was choledocholithiasis.
The degree of hepatic dysfunction (HD) was identified taking into account of cholestasis (total serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase activity in blood) and cytolysis syndromes (levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase).
Liver dysfunction degree I was observed in 21 patients, degree II--in 14, degree III--in 10 and degree IV--in 9 patients.
In 13 patients OJ was complicated with purulent cholangitis (PCh).
Serum concentration of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 was determined.
Cytokine status imbalance was diagnosed in all patients with benign mechanical jaundice on admission.  Levels of serum proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-6 were greater and the level of IL-2 was lower than those in healthy people.
The analysis has showed that severity of cytokine imbalance depends on the degree of LD and level of hyperbilirubinemia.
Imbalance in cytokine regulation manifests in disorders of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokinesratio.
