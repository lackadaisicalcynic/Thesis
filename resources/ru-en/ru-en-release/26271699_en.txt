[Optimization of staged treatment in patients with extensive combined face defects].
Free autotransplantation of revascularized flaps allow reconstructing soft tissue integrity with simultaneous bone defects elimination in patients with extensive combined face defects, but for eligible reconstruction of facial proportions one may need additional surgical procedures.  The study included 161 patients who underwent free autotransplantation of revascularized flaps.
Main pitfalls of the method are revealed and reviewed in the paper.  When corresponding to deformity type free autotransplantation of revascularized flaps results in full functional and esthetic rehabilitation.
