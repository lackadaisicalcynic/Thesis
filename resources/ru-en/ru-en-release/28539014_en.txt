Process of endogenous homeostatic characteristics decline in two suproopganismal biosystems from the standpoint of parametabolistic theory of senescence.
Endogenous decline in homeostatic characteristics of supraorganismal level systems is similar to individual senescence.  Similarity is in the fact that this decline as individual senescence is called by negative consequences from specialization of elements the system consists.
In systems of supraorganismal level these effects are analogues of parametabolic reactions of senescence individuals.
