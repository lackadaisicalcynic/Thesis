OBJECTIVE  To assess the efficacy of aminophenylbutyric acid (anvifen), a synthetic GABA-receptor agonist, in the treatment of adult patients with tension type headache (TTH).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty-seven patients with episodic TTH (ETTH) and 30 patients with chronic TTH (CTTH) were examined.
The area under the headache curve, sleep quality, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores and stress resistance measured by an original questionnaire were evaluated.
RESULTS
Anvifen in dose of 250 mg TID during 3 weeks had a positive effect on all parameters studied, excluding the area under the headache curve in CTTH.
Similar results were demonstrated after the subsequent course of treatment for 3 weeks.  CONCLUSION
Anvifen was highly effective in ETTH but less effective in CTTH.  A combination of anvifen with antidepressants can be recommended for patients with CTTH.
