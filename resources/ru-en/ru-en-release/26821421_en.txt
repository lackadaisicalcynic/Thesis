[Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma: Principles of diagnosis and treatment].
AIM  To describe the clinical and morphological features of the rare Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) subtype--nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Forty-two patients were diagnosed with NLPHL in 2010 to 2014.
The male to female ratio was 2.2:1; the median age was 37 years (range 17-68 years).
NLPHL was diagnosed on the basis of the histological and immunohistochemical examinations of tumor biopsy specimens; disease stages were determined by standard HL studies.
RESULTS
Before NLPHL was detected, 23 (55%) patients were diagnosed as having HL in 13 cases, follicular lymphoma in 2, lymphofollicular hyperplasia in 3, angioimmunoblastic lymphoma in 1, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 3, and B-cell lymphoma (non-HL) in 1.
Long-term (3-21-year; median 8 years) persistent lymphadenopathy was observed in 16 (38%) patients.
Seventeen (40.5%) patients had early (I-II) stages of the disease and 25 (59.5%) had advanced stages.
B symptoms were noted in 24% of cases.
There was involvement of extranodal sites (salivary gland, tonsil) in 2 patients, spleen in 14 (33%), bone marrow in 8, and bulky disease in 2.
Cycles of ABVD ± rituximab ± radiotherapy (RT) were used in early-stage NLPHL; those of R-BEACOPP-14 ± RT were performed in the advanced stages of the disease or its transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with excessive T cells.
CONCLUSION
When patients have a history of long-term asymptomatic lymphadenopathy, it is necessary to rule out NLPHL, for which purpose an immunohistochemical examination of a biopsy specimen and its reexamination in a laboratory having experience in diagnosing NLPHL must necessarily be done.
Lower RT doses and rituximab incorporated into the cycle of treatment are indicated to reduce its toxicity and to preserve therapeutic efficiency.
