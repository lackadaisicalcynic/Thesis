[Morphological changes of cornea in children with hyperopia in the immediate and remote postoperative period after laser keratomieleusis according to confocal microscopy data].  Studying morphological changes of cornea in the remote postoperative period is becoming increasingly relevant with refractive surgeries being adapted for children.
PURPOSE  comparative analysis of keratocyte density and hystomorphologic changes of cornea after laser in situ keratomieleusis (LASIK) and femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK (FS-LASIK) in children with hyperopia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
109 patients aged 6-17 years in 2 groups were examined with 'Confoscan-4' confocal microscope.
RESULTS
In comparison with initial data, keratocyte density decreased in the immediate postoperative period after FS-LASIK and LASIK in average by 17.09%, 64.31% and 12.2% in the corneal flap, directly in the laser influence zone (interface) and in the retroablation zone respectively.
After 5 years, keratocyte density decreased in the corneal flap, interface zone and retroablation zone by 12.01%, 48.71% and 8.06% respectively in comparison with initial data.
A circular scar at the flap edge was left after FS-LASIK; keratocyte density in the corneal flap and in the interface zone was in average 8.9% and 15.28% higher respectively, and twice more subepithelial nerves were noted compared to LASIK.
CONCLUSIONS
In the remote postoperative period keratocyte density in the corneal decreased in average by 43% after FS-LASIK and by 46% after LASIK in comparison with initial data.
No changes were seen in the morphologic state of the cornea outside the influence zone.
Both the technologies are safe, however keratocyte density and the number of subepithelial nerves are higher in the cornea flap and in the interface zone after FS-LASIK; corneal stability is assured by a circular scar formed at the flap edge.
