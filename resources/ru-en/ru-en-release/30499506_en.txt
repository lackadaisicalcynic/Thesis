[Spasticity: from pathophysiology to treatment].  The article presents modern views on the pathophysiology of spasticity, which is a frequent disabling consequence to the upper motor neuron (UMN) damage.
Morphological and functional system of motion organization and the changes after the UMN damage is considered.
The authors analyze existing definitions of spasticity.
Stages of spasticity development are described in the context of neuroplasticity as well as in the framework of pathogenesis and sanogenesis.
Existing ideas of its pathogenesis are compared with the typical clinical symptoms.
The occurring pathological processes in muscles, tendons and joints that can aggravate the development of spasticity and complicate the diagnosis are considered.
In addition, the main pathological spasticity patterns are described and the current development of diagnostic techniques is estimated.
A review of main methods of spasticity treatment is presented.
Special attention is paid to the botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT) preparations and central action muscle relaxants.
The pathophysiological basement for complex treatment of spasticity as a part of the general rehabilitation process is given, so that the BoNT can be considered as the obligatory element of standard rehabilitation programs.
