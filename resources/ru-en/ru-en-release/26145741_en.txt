[The algorithm for the combined treatment of pyoinflammatory ENT diseases in the patients with diabetes mellitus].  The objective of the present study was to determine the leading clinical and pathogenetic factors determining the clinical course of the pyoinflammatory ENT diseases in the patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and to develop the algorithm for the rational therapy of these conditions.
A total of 145 patients presenting with pyoinflammatory ENT diseases and concomitant diabetes mellitus were available for the examination that included the microbiological and biochemical studies, determination of the total lipid spectrum, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level, and glycemic profile.
Also, the body mass index of the patients was estimated along with the type and severity of obesity.
Moreover, the character of antibacterial and hypoglycemic therapy was evaluated.
The mathematical analysis of the data obtained revealed the clinical and biochemical parameters determining the clinical picture of the pyoinflammatory ENT diseases in the patients with diabetes mellitus.
These were localization of the pyogenic process in the larynx, abdominal obesity, fasting hyperglycemia in excess of 8.3 mmol/l, and dyslipidemia accompanied by the reduction in the amount of high density lipoproteins to below 40 mg/100 ml and the increase of low density lipoproteins to above 155 mg/100 ml.
The results of the study were used to develop the differentialalgorithm for the combined treatment of pyoinflammatory ENT diseases in the patients with diabetes mellitus based on the proposed original scale for the prediction of pyogenic complications.
