[The first experience of har-rar and radiofrequency ablation for hemorrhoidal disease treatment in hospitalization replacement environment].  AIM
To analyze advisability of HAL-RAR combined with radiofrequency ablation for hemorrhoidal disease under stationary substitution conditions.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 152 patients.  Technical features of this procedure are presented.
RESULTS
RFA was not followed by prolonged hospital-stay, advanced pain syndrome.  Moreover, favorable outcomes were obtained including patients with hemorrhoidal disease stage 3 and 4.
CONCLUSION
HAL-RAR combined with radiofrequency ablation may be recommended for treatment of hemorrhoidal disease in stationary substitution conditions.
