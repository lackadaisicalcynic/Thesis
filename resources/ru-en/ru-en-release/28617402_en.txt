[Retrospective study on treatment results of patients with bone destruction in lower molars roots area].
The paper presents retrospective study on the efficiency of tooth protecting operations in patients with odontogenic bone destruction in lower molars roots area.  The study was based on the analysis of medical records of patients treated in Central Research Institute of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery from 2011 to 2016.
Tooth protecting procedures because of bone destruction in lower molars were carried out in 98 patients but only 59 of them were accessible to proper follow-up.
Complications were seen in 15.2% of patients and teeth were extracted in 13.5% of cases.  Thus, the efficacy of tooth protecting procedures in lower molars was 86.5%, which proves their feasibility despite of complicated surgical approach.
