[Divasa in the treatment and prevention of cerebrovascular diseases].  Disturbances of hemorheology, hemostasis and fibrinolysis play an important role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of chronic cerebral ischemia.
Physiological functioning of the endothelium is disturbed under the action of damaging factors.
Divaza is created on the basis of release-active antibodies to S100b protein and antibodies to endothelial NO-synthase.
The efficacy of divaza in the treatment of chronic cerebral ischemia and related diseases (cognitive impairment, anxiety) was demonstrated.
A normalizing effect of divaza in the dose of 2 tablets 3 times daily between meals during 12 weeks on endothelial function is shown.
