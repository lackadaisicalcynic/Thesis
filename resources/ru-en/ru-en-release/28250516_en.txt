Implementing health insurance for migrants, Thailand.
PROBLEM
Undocumented migrant workers are generally ineligible for state social security schemes, and either forego needed health services or pay out of pocket.  APPROACH
In 2001, the Thai Ministry of Public Health introduced a policy on migrant health.
Migrant health insurance is a voluntary scheme, funded by an annual premium paid by workers.  It enables access to health care at public facilities and reduces catastrophic health expenditures for undocumented migrants and their dependants.
A range of migrant-friendly services, including trained community health volunteers, was introduced in the community and workplace.  In 2014, the government introduced a multisectoral policy on migrants, coordinated across the interior, labour, public health and immigration ministries.
LOCAL SETTING
In 2011, around 0.3 million workers, less than 9% of the estimated migrant labour force of 3.5 million, were covered by Thailand's social security scheme.
RELEVANT CHANGES
A review of the latest data showed that from April to July 2016, 1 146 979 people (33.7% of the total estimated migrant labourers of 3 400 787) applied, were screened and were enrolled in the migrant health insurance scheme.  Health volunteers, recruited from migrant communities and workplaces are appreciated by local communities and are effective in promoting health and increasing uptake of health services by migrants.
The capacity of the health ministry to innovate and manage migrant health insurance was a crucial factor enabling expanded health insurance coverage for undocumented migrants.  Continued policy support will be needed to increase recruitment to the insurance scheme and to scale-up migrant-friendly services.
