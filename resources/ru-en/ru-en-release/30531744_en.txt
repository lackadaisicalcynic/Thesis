[Problem of decision-making in surgery].
Decision-making process is often complex, responsible and not always reflected in surgical protocol.
Some surgeons usually prefer standard finishing of procedure; others talk about individual approach but they have some preferences; the third ones analyze all possible perioperative factors (pre- and intraoperative data) and seek to justify differentiated approach.
Some aspects of these processes are discussed in this report.
