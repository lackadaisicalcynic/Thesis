[Microcrystalline stress in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis].
AIM  To estimate the rate of articular cartilage microcrystallization in osteoarthritis (OA).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The investigation included 110 people who had undergone total endoprosthetic replacement for coxarthrosis.
A total of 50 patients with total hip endoprosthetic replacement for femoral neck fractures were recruited as a comparison group.
An X-ray diffractometer was used to detect crystals.
RESULTS
Cartilage mineralization was seen in 72% of the patients with late-stage OA.
CONCLUSION
Articular cartilage microcrystalline stress is a constant sign of late-stage OA requiring further clinical interpretation.
