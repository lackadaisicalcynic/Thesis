[Leber hereditary optic neuropathy].
Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is characterized by bilateral, painless loss of vision in children and young adults (generally up to 25 years old).  Since its first description in 1871, the understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis has improved considerably.
The article considers Leber neuropathy from the points of view of ophthalmology, neurology and molecular genetics, and presents data on experimental treatment methods, one of which is undergoing clinical trial.
