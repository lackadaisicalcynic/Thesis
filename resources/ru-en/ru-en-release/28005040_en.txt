[Genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency viruses and antiretroviral therapy].  The lecture is devoted to the analysis of the state-of-the-art of the impact of genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency (HIV) viruses on the pattern of infection and the efficiency of antiretroviral therapy (ART).
It provides brief information on the origin and evolution of HIV and on the current classification of their genetic variants.
The molecular epidemiological situation of HIV infection in Russia and nearby states and the major molecular HIV variants that are dominant in these countries, as well as their origin and prevalence trends are characterized.  How the diversity of HIV can affect the efficiency of diagnosis, the transmission of the virus, and the pattern of HIV pathogenesis are briefly reviewed.
The comparative data available in the world's scientific literature on these topics are given.  More detailed attention is given to the possible causes of varying therapeutic effects against different HIV subtypes, as well as to the specific features of the formation and phenotyping manifestation of ART drug resistance mutations.
There is evidence for the necessity of forming a unified follow-up system for treated HIV-infected patients during ART scaling, including in an effort to evaluate the impact of the specific features of the HIV genome on the efficiency of treatment regimens used in Russia.
