[Thrombosis of the portal, upper mesenteric, and splenic veins in a patient with thrombophilia (a clinical case report)].  Currently there are several dozens of hereditarily associated thrombophilias and acquired states known to condition the development of a thrombus.
Thrombosis of visceral veins appears to be a considerably less often encountered event than thrombosis in the system of visceral arteries.
Presented herein in the article is a clinical case report concerning subacute thrombosis of the portal, upper mesenteric and splenic veins, having developed on the background of mutations of 7 genes of the system of haemostasis in a young adult patient.
Timely comprehensive examination with determining polymorphism of the haemostasis system genes made it possible to verify the aetiology of the disease in the patient, while multispiral computed tomography contributed favourably to specifying the extension of thrombosis.
Due to the developed segmental necrosis of the small intestine the patient was subjected to resection of the necrotised portion of the small intestine followed by establishing an entero-enteric anastomosis.
In the postoperative period adequate anticoagulant therapy was adjusted in order to prevent relapse of thrombogenesis.
