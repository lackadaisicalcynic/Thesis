Community participation for transformative action on women's, children's and adolescents' health.  The Global strategy for women's, children's and adolescents' health (2016-2030) recognizes that people have a central role in improving their own health.
We propose that community participation, particularly communities working together with health services (co-production in health care), will be central for achieving the objectives of the global strategy.  Community participation specifically addresses the third of the key objectives: to transform societies so that women, children and adolescents can realize their rights to the highest attainable standards of health and well-being.
In this paper, we examine what this implies in practice.  We discuss three interdependent areas for action towards greater participation of the public in health: improving capabilities for individual and group participation; developing and sustaining people-centred health services; and social accountability.
We outline challenges for implementation, and provide policy-makers, programme managers and practitioners with illustrative examples of the types of participatory approaches needed in each area to help achieve the health and development goals.
