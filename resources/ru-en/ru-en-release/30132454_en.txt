[The efficacy of cellex combined with sanatorium-based rehabilitation scheme in patients with cerebral palsy].
AIM
To study the efficacy of the drug cellex combined with sanatorium treatment in the rehabilitation of patients with cerebral palsy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included 59 patients, mean age 17.06Â±0.7 years, with spastic form of cerebral palsy who were administered a course of sanatorium-spa treatment in a specialized spa-resort.
All patients underwent complex clinical and neurological examinations and electroencephalography.
The main group (n=23) received cellex (a course of 10 injections) in addition to traditional treatment.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The efficacy of treatment assessed by the level of hand functioning and cognitive abilities was higher in the main group compared to the patients of control and comparison groups.
Besides, the higher academic performance and positive dynamics of EEG (higher alpha rhythm amplitudes and decreased activity of pathological rhythms) were observed.
