[Actual problems of brain pathology in cerebral microangiopathy].
Cerebral microangiopathy (small vessels disease) is a cause of diffuse changes of brain tissue (encephalopathy) denoted in Russian literature by the term dyscirculatory encephalopathy (DE).  The main cause of microangiopathy leading to encephalopathy is arterial hypertension, less frequently - cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
The diagnosis of encephalopathy in patients with microangiopathy is based on the combination of clinical manifestations (mainly, cognitive impairment of varying severity and disorders of gait) with the neuroimaging changes (white matter hyperintensity, multiple lacunar infarcts on MRI).
The causes of DE hyperdiagnosis in Russia, its differential diagnosis with the consequences of recurrent strokes as well as the question of the terminology are considered.  The term 'microangioencephalopathy' (instead of DE) to denote encephalopathy in patients with the cerebral small vessel disease is proposed, as more fully reflecting morphological changes of the brain.
