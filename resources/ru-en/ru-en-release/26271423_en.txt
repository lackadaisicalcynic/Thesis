[Infectious complications after kindred kidney allotransplantation].
It was analyzed the medical records of 231 patients who underwent living kindred donor kidney transplantation.
Early postoperative complications were observed in 51 (22%) patients including infectious events in 30 cases namely pyelonephritis (13), pneumonia (6), sepsis (5), wound infection (3), pulmonary tuberculosis (2) and esophageal mycosis (1).
Microflora investigation revealed predominantly gram-negative bacteria including enterobacteriaceae (K. pneumoniae, E. coli and E. cloacae) and nonfermentable bacteria (P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp.).
Analysis of 7-year antibiotic susceptibility showed that polymyxin, imipenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam and amikacin preserve their activity against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas; linezolid, vancomycinum and moxifloxacin--against staphylococcus; voriconazole, amphotericinum B and fluconazole--against Candida spp.  These medicines are preferred for antibiotic prevention of perioperative and early postoperative infectious complications.
