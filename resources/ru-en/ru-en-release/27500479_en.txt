[The morphometric characteristics of the main structural components of renal nephrons in the white rats with experimentally induced acute and chronic alcohol intoxication].
The objective of the present work was to study the morphometric characteristics of the main structural components of renal nephrons in the white rats with the experimentally induced acute and chronic alcohol intoxication.  We undertook the morphometric examination of the structural elements of rat kidneys with the subsequent statistical analysis of the data obtained.
The results of the study give evidence of the toxic action of ethanol on all structural components of the nephron in the case of both acute and chronic alcohol intoxication.
The study revealed some specific features of the development of pathological process in the renal tissue structures at different stages of alcohol intoxication.
The most pronounced morphological changes were observed in the renal proximal tubules and the least pronounced ones in the structure of the renal glomeruli.  The earliest morphological changes become apparent in distal convoluted tubules of the nephron; in the case of persistent alcoholemia, they first develop in the renal corpuscles and thereafter in the distal proximal tubules.
The maximum changes occur in the case of acute alcohol intoxication and between 2 weeks and 2 months of chronic intoxication; they become less conspicuous during a later period.
