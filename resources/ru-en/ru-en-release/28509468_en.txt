[Age-related changes of the content of angiomatin and endostatin in human skin].
Human skin structures stained positively for angiomotin or endostatin were studied by indirect immunohistochemical method.  Skin specimens from frontal surface of the lower part of the neck (from upper corner of standard autopsy skin incision) from human fetuses died antenatally from 20 to 40 weeks of pregnancy, humans who died from different causes from 1 day to 85 years of life were obtained at autopsy.
Positive staining for angiomotin or endostatin in the skin was found in epidermal cells, fibroblasts, sweat and sebaceous glands, blood vessels of the dermis.  Blood vessels stained positively for angiomotin were detected in skin samples in all ages.
Age-dependent decrease in the content of angiomotin in blood vessels of the dermis was detected.
Most prominent decrease in angiomotin content in dermal blood vessels was found in 61-85 years age-group.  Endostatin positive blood vessels were also detected in skin samples of all ages.
However, the intensity of staining for endostatin in dermal blood vessels was increased during aging.  It can be proposed that changes in the content of angiomotin and endostatin yield a negative impact on angiogenesis in human skin during aging.
