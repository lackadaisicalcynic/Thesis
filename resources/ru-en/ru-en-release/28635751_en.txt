[Effects of body positioning in patients with non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhages].  The article presents an analysis of different methods of positioning patients with acute cerebral pathology.
Changing of 'head-of-the bed' position is a routine and simple method of correction of intracranial hypertension.  For the majority of patients with cerebral damage, regardless of the etiological factor, 15-30Â° 'head - of - the bed' position is preferable.
However, in some cases head-of-bed manipulation can lead to the irreversible ischemic damage due to the reduction in systemic and perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow.
Thus, the selection of the optimal body position in different types of acute cerebral pathology remains a debated issue.
