[The relations between quality of life, morbidity of chronic non-infectious diseases and use of medications in stroke patients].  Objective.
To determine relations between quality of life, morbidity of chronic non-infectious diseases and use of pharmaceuticals by stroke patients.  Material and methods.
The case group consisted of 508 Kaunas citizens, aged 25-84 years, who survived the stroke.
The control group consisted of randomly chosen 508 sex- and age-matched Kaunas citizens without stroke.
SF-12 questionnaire on the quality of life was used.
Quality of life was analysed in physical and mental health domains taking into consideration morbidity of chronic non-infectious diseases and use of pharmaceuticals.
The percentage of those who had more than one chronic non-infectious disease was 38.6 in the case group and 17.2 in the control group (p<0.001).
With respect to the use of antihypertensive (66.5% in the case group and 67.3% in the control group), antithrombotic (21.5% and 24.6%) and antidepressant (100% and 100%) medication, case and control groups were similar.
Results and conclusion.
Compared to people without arterial hypertension, scores in physical health domain were lower in people with arterial hypertension (p=0.018) and the control group (p=0,0005).  In the main group, people without atrial fibrillation scored lower (p=0.0005) in physical health domain compared to those with atrial fibrillation.
Scores in mental health domain were lower in the control group (p=0.048).
Compared to people with diabetes mellitus (DM), those with DM scored lower in the case group (p=0.0005).
The use of antihypertensive or antithrombotic medication before stroke did not predict quality of life in patients with chronic non-infectious diseases.
Meanwhile, in the control group the use of antithrombotic medication improved (p<0.05) the quality of life in physical health domain.
