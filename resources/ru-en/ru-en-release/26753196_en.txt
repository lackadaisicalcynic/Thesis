[Surgical approaches in surgery for cicatrical tracheal stenosis].  At present time several surgical approaches are being used for cicatrical tracheal stenosis including cervicotomy, longitudinal- circumferential sternotomy and thoracotomy.
Besides location of stenosis an approach is being determined by constitutional and anatomical features of patient, surgeon's and anesthesiologist's experience, well-coordinated work of operating team.
If pathological process is placed in cervico-laryngeal, cervical and upper thoracic segment cervicotomy is preferable.
Partial longitudinal-circumferential sternotomy is believed to be adequate in case of lesion of thoracic trachea and its bifurcation.
This approach provides all types of tracheal reconstructions.
Technical difficulties appear if process is localized in membranous wall of suprabifurcational part, bifurcation and primary bronchus.
In these cases we recommend thoracotomy through the bed of resected the 3rd or the 4th ribs and patient's position on his front.
Interventions including pulmonary tissue resection and tracheal edges convergence are possible through thoracotomy.
