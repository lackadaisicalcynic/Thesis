[The injuries to the nose and paranasal sinuses in the children resulting from shooting an air rifle].  This article reports two clinical cases of the successful treatment of the gunshot wounds in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses of the children resulting from the careless use of the pneumatic weapons.

The bullets were localized in the nasal septum of one child and in the frontal recess of the other as is typical of the injuries inflicted to the nose and paranasal sinuses by the shots from the air rifles.
Multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) is known to have a number of important advantages over the roentgenological examination for determining the location of the bullets.
Bullets for pneumatic rifles are manufactured in the form of the balls either from lead or copper-coated steel; therefore, they are a priory can not be removed with the use of a magnet.
