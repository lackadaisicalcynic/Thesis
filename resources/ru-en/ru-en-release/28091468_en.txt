[Reoperations after cochlear implantation].  The objective of the present study: the improvement of the quality and effectiveness of the surgical stage of cochlear implantation on the basis of the comprehensive analysis of performed reoperations.
PATIENTS  84 patients of the 2413 ones who had undergone cochlear implantation were re-examined by revision surgery within various periods after the first intervention.
MAIN RESULTS  In certain patients, the correction of the intracochlear electrode array position was performed and in 72 cases the replacement of the implant was done.
The most frequent cause of the replacement of the implant was the failure of the device.
In the case of the extrusion and inflammation, the two-stage surgical treatment was applied.
The exposure of the different parts of the cochlear implant with the duration up to 2 weeks was considered as a complication which could be adequately corrected.
The surgical treatment of such patients was carried out in a single stage.
The reparation processes at the place of the first intervention were strongly expressed, especially in children.
Standardization of the cochlear implantation surgical stage based on the determination of its optimum volume in our Center led to a decrease in the number of reoperations and made the learning process easier to master for young otosurgeons.  CONCLUSION
It is can be concluded that the reoperation after primary cochlear implantation is a highly effective technique and, taking into account the listed features, doesnot present difficulties for the qualified otosurgeon.
