[Topical problems of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C].
Antiviral therapy using interferon-free regimens for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is being more frequently practiced by hepatologists due to the high efficiency of a short treatment cycle and the lowest rate of adverse events.
The review discusses the most topical problems that will present themselves in practicing hematologists when treating patients with CHC under the present-day conditions.  The use of direct-acting antiviral drugs requires knowledge and skills for physicians to orient themselves in the list of these drugs to create their based regimens, the efficiency and safety of which are proven in the context of evidence-based medicine.
The review gives data on the efficiency and safety of 3D therapy for CHC according to the baseline characteristics of patients.
