[Comparative long-term results of surgical treatment of patients with diffuse toxic goiter].  AIM  To analyze long-term outcomes of Graves' disease management.  MATERIAL AND METHODS  There were 428 patients for the periods 2000-2004 and 2005-2010.
Patients were called for examination and thyroid status control.
2 groups were compared: group 1 of 203 patients and group 2 of 225 patients.  RESULTS
It was found that after subtotal resection by original technique (patent 1802309 of the Russian Federation, MPK 5 G01N1, 1/28) in group 1 euthyroid state was observed in more than half (59.4%) of patients, hypothyroidism - 30.3% and recurrence - in 10.3% 10 years postoperatively.  At the same time most of patients of group 2 (71.6%) after predominant thyroidectomy had hypothyroidism, euthyroid state was only in 24%.
Postoperative recurrent diffuse toxic goiter incidence was 4.7%.
CONCLUSION  The dynamics of postoperative thyroid status depending on type of surgery and follow-up was presented.
