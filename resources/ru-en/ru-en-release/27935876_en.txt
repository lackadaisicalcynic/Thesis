[Concentration of matrix metalloproteinases and magnesium ions in patients with varicose veins of lower limbs].  The study was aimed at investigating alterations in the concentration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-9) and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), as well as the level of magnesium ions (Mg2+) as an indicator of connective tissue dysplasia (CTD) in patients presenting with lower limb varicose veins.  The study included a total of 110 people.  Of these, the Study Group comprised 90 patients with lower limb varicose veins of clinical class C2-C6 (according to the CEAP classification) and the Control Group was composed of 20 apparently healthy volunteers.  Samples of peripheral blood were examined.  The content of MMP-9, MMP-1 and TIMP-1 in blood serum was determined by means of the quantitative solid-phase immunoenzymatic assay.  The concentration of Mg2+ was determined by the colorimetric method.  We revealed a statistically significant interrelationship between the concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases and severity of varicose transformation of lower-limb veins, with the highest level of matrix metalloproteinases being observed in patients with cutaneous alterations and trophic ulcers.
Determination of the level of matrix metalloproteinases and magnesium ions, characterizing connective tissue dysplasia, makes it possible to predict the development of lower limb chronic venous insufficiency and to evaluate the degree of its severity.
