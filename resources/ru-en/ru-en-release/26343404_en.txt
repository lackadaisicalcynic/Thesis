[Cephalometric findings in patients with TMJ anterior disk displacement without reduction].  Objective of the study was to determine representative cephalometric signs for the patients with TMJ anterior disk displacement without reduction (ADWoR).
Twenty one female patients with ADWoR, which was confirmed by MRI, were included in the study.  Cephalometric parameters described by Arnett-McLaughlin and Jarabak were measured by means of lateral cephalograms and computed tomograms (CT) to determine the growth pattern of the facial skeleton.
All the data obtained was evaluated statistically.
The investigation has revealed reduction in vertical measurements of facial skeleton and several signs of hyperdivergent growth pattern in the sample.
