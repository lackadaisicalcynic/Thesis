[Impact of the dosing of basic drugs on the risk of rehospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure].
AIM  To investigate the impact of doses of the drugs, which have been achieved during adjustment and account for less or more than 50% of the maximal therapeutic ones on the risk of rehospitalization.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The data of the Pavlov Register were used to assess the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.  To assess the risk of rehospitalization in relation of the dose of a drug, all the doses were represented in percentage terms depending on the maximum therapeutic one.
RESULTS  The risk of hospitalization during 6 months in the patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at a dose of 25% or less of the therapeutic one was 21.18% (odds ratio (OR), 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.13-1.76), that at doses of 50 and 100% of the therapeutic one was 16% (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56-0.88) and 34% (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43-0.60), respectively.
The risk of rehospitalization in the patients taking Î²-blockers at doses of 25, 50, and 100% of the therapeutic one was 26% (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.94-1.17), 23% (OR, 0.902; 95% CI, 0.75-1.07), and 6.25% (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07-0.56), respectively.
The combined analysis of the dose and use frequency of diuretics showed that the highest risk of rehospitalization turned was noted in the patients using a single dose of 100 mg of furosemide (4.2% of cases) once weekly and was as high as 39% (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 1.04-1.98).
CONCLUSION
The risk of rehospitalization is largely determined by the dosing factor in outpatient settings.
Increasing the doses during adjustment reduces the risk of rehospitalization.
