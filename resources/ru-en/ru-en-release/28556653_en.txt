[Recovery form of the vertebral body in a transpedicular fixation at spine fractures associated with osteoporosis].  We analyzed the correction indexes of posttraumatic deformation in 27 patients aged 61-76 years (62,9Â±1,4 years), when using an osteoplasty and transpedicular of fixation in respect of fractures of bodies vertebras of the thoracic and lumbar localization, associated with osteoporosis.
Indicators of posttraumatic deformation the wedging index (WI) and the segmental kyphosis (SK) decreased at all patients.
At the same time the minimally invasive (transcutaneous) operation allowed to achieve recovery of the lost anatomy and does not concede to results of open intervention.
In group of patients with compression fractures decreased WI and SK, and in group with burst nature of damage only WI authentically decreased.
Both indicators of deformation decreased at patients with T-criterion more than -3 SD, and only WI authentically decreased at patients with more expressed decrease in mineral density (T-criterion >-3).
The received results show recovery of the lost anatomy, at the same time extent of correction depends on character fractures and the number of bone masses.
