[Study cytoflavin dose-dependent effect in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke].  AIM
To compare the efficacy of cytoflavin in doses of 10 and 20 ml/day in the complex pharmacological therapy of patients with acute ischemic stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty-six patients, aged from 43 to 85 years, were examined.
Patient's status was assessed using the NIHSS, the Rankin scale, the Barthel index and the Rivermead mobility index.
Patients were stratified into 3 groups: patients of group 1 received standard treatment, patients of group 2 received cytoflavin in dose of 10 ml/day in addition to standard treatment and patients of group 3 were treated with cytoflavin in dose of 20 ml/day in addition to standard treatment.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Cytoflavin in doses of 10 and 20 ml/day significantly promotes the regression of neurological deficit, improves day-to-day activity, and therefore, improves functional independence in daily life.  The dose-dependent effect of the drug was shown.
The use of cytoflavin in dose of 20 ml/day resulted in the more rapid regress of neurological symptoms during inpatient treatment and higher indices of daily activities and functional independence of patients that was important for the further rehabilitation.
