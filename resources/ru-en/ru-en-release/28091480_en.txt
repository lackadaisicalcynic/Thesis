[The application of lasers in otorhinolaryngology].  The objective of this review is to summarize and systematize the data concerning the modern laser and laser-based systems, their characteristics, and possible applications in various spheres of medicine including otorhinolaryngology.
The application of laser technologies in medical practice gains ever increasing popularity.
Lasers have been successfully used during a long period for the diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.  At present, they are just as actively applied in different fields of the surgical practice.
Otorhinolaryngology makes the most extensive use of neodymium, CO2, and holmium lasers.
The latter has the most universal characteristics and is operated in a relatively short wavelength range (Î»=2.01 mcm); moreover, its radiation penetrates as deep as 0.4 mm into the biological tissues.  In other words, the holmium laser not only combines the advantages of the CO2 and neodymium lasers but is also devoid of their shortcomings.
The holmium laser is considered to be the most promising source of laser radiation for the application in otorhinolaryngological surgery with a potential encompassing the most wide spectrum of surgical manipulations needed to treat pathological changes in the ears, nose, and throat.  The application of this instrument in medical practice opens up new prospects for the development of otorhinolaryngology.
