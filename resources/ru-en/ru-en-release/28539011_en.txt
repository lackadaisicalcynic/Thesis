The features of lymph node reactions to tissue damage of lymph collecting region at old rats.
The features of submandibular lymph node (LN) reactions after lower jaw tissue damage at old rats were studied by method of light microscopy.  In LN of old rats for all terms of observation, including intact control, the volume of connective tissue is considerable increased.
Besides, old animals in LN have of more change duration of a cortical plateau volume, less - of paracortex and lymphoid nodules without light centers.  Features of cellular element number consisted in considerable decrease in quantity of lymphocytes, mitotic figures, immunoblasts and plasmablasts against increase in keeping of macrophages, cells with destruction, stromal elements and erythrocytes.
