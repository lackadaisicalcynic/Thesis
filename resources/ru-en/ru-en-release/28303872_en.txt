[Perforated peptic ulcer closure: laparoscopic or open?]
AIM
To compare laparoscopic and open closure of perforated peptic ulcer (PPU).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included 153 patients who underwent PPU suturing.
78 patients underwent laparoscopic closure (laparoscopic group) and open suturing via upper midline laparotomy was performed in 75 cases (open group).  Surgery time, postoperative pain severity, time of analgesics intake, postoperative complications, hospital-stay and and cosmetic effect were compared.
RESULTS
Laparoscopic PPU closure may be effective and accessible in experienced endoscopic surgeon.
It significantly reduces postoperative pain severity, need for analgesics, incidence of postoperative complications and provides excellent cosmetic effect.  However, there is greater time of surgery compared with open intervention.
There were no significant differences in hspital-stay between groups.  CONCLUSION
Laparoscopic PPU suturing can be considered a good alternative to open surgery.  Further researches are needed for standardization, assessment of safety, real advantages and disadvantages of laparoscopic technique.
