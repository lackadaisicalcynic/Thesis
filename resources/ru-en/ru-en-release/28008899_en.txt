[Surgery for non-small cell lung carcinoma after previous chemoradiotherapy alone].
AIM  To investigate early and remote results of surgery in patients with recurrent non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) after previous chemoradiotherapy alone.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The retrospective study included 14 NSCLC patients (10 men and 4 women, mean age 52.6 years) who were operated in thoracic department for the period June 2008 - December 2013.
Histologically squamous cell carcinoma prevailed (64.3%).
Prior to surgery stage IIB was diagnosed in 2 patients, IIIA in 11 and IIIB in 1 patient.
The dose of radiotherapy ranged from 45 to 70 Gr (median 58Gr).
The average number of chemotherapy cycles was 3.8 per patient.
Pneumonectomy was performed in all patients except one who underwent left-sided lower lobectomy.
In all cases bronchial stump was covered by vascularized muscle flap (intercostal, latissimus dorsi).
Postoperative complications were classified by TMM system (Thoracic Morbidity and Mortality System).
RESULTS
Postoperative complications were observed in 7 (50.0%) patients including level II in 2 cases, IIIA in 1 case, IVA in 3 patients and V (death) in 1 (7.1%) patient.
Postoperative stages of lung cancer were IB in 2 cases, IIA in 1, IIB in 5, IIIA in 4 and IIIB in 2 patients.
Overall 1, 2 and 3-year survival rate was 89.1%, 82.0% and 48.0% respectively (median 35.0 months).
Recurrence-free survival was 84.2%, 72.0% and 24.8%, respectively (median 28.0 months).
Overall and recurrence-free 5-year survival rate was 10.8%.
CONCLUSION
«Salvage» surgery may be recommended as individual approach in patients with reccurent lung cancer after previous chemoradiotherapy.
