[Acoustic analysis of the lacrimal gland in sarcoidosis].  PURPOSE
To analyze the condition of the lacrimal gland in patients confirmed to have sarcoidosis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 46 patients (92 orbits) with verified diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis that were examined during the period of 2009 to 2014.
The age of patients ranged from 23 to 65 years and the average was 45.1 years.
Among the examined patients, 66% were female and 34% male.
In all patients, the diagnosis was verified according to modern criteria.
RESULTS
Acoustic structure of 46 lacrimal glands of patients with systemic sarcoidosis (92 orbit), and lacrimal glands of 30 healthy individuals (60 orbits) were examined.
In-depth in vivo examination of morphological changes was done using 'advanced' analysis of three-dimensional images.
CONCLUSION
The analysis of a large number of studies devoted to changes in the lacrimal glands caused by sarcoidosis revealed a difficult problem: are there any differences between isolated involvement of the lacrimal gland tissue and the defeat of various organs and tissues?
For now, the question remains unanswered.
