[Portal hypertensive gastropathy].  In spite of a great number of publications, as yet there is no agreement that which of the detected morphological changes should be considered pathognomonic in portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG).
The study of the pathogenesis of PHG suggested a diversity of mechanisms involved in varying degrees in the development of this abnormality.
The paper summarizes the data available in the literature on the role of endothelial dysfunction, apoptosis, damaging factors, and H. pylori infection in the development of this abnormality.
A differential diagnosis was made between PHG and GAVE syndrome and histological features in both groups were revealed.
