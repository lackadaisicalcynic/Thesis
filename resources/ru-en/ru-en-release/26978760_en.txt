[The difficulties of diagnosis and treatment of non-occlusive mesenteric circulatory disorders].  AIM
To review one of actual problems of emergency surgery - diagnosis and treatment of patients with non-occlusive mesenteric circulatory disorders.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The article presents the clinical observations showing the ambiguity of clinical picture, features and challenges of diagnosis, treatment of disease and opportunities for positive outcomes.  Diagnostic methods are x-ray, abdominal ultrasonography according to which acute abdominal ischemia may be assumed.
However, in all unclear cases diagnostic videolaparoscopy is mandatory to determine further tactics.  Unfortunately diagnostic videolaparoscopy is not always interpreted comprehensively and not a definitive method of diagnosis.
Wide surgical access is usually necessary for non-occlusal acute violation of mesenteric circulation and volume of surgery varies from segmental to subtotal intestinal and colic resection with obligatory enteral intubation and decompression.  Thus, complex pre- and postoperative treatment is required.
