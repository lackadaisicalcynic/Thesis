[Experience of the use of gasserian ganglion balloon compression in patients with trigeminal neuralgia associated with multiple sclerosis].
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy of gasserian ganglion balloon compression in patients with trigeminal neuralgia associated with multiple sclerosis (MS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eight patients (3 men, 5 women), aged from 46 to 66 years (mean age 55 years), with trigeminal neuralgia associated with MS underwent surgery.
An average duration of the pain syndrome was 8,4 years.
Six patients had previous surgeries due to facial pain.
Percutaneous balloon compression of gasserian ganglion was performed to all patients.
Follow up period was from 2 to 24 months.
RESULTS
Six patients (75%) reported 100% of pain relief right after the surgery, 2 patients (25%) reported a significant decrease of pain (2-3 points on VAS).
Pain recurrence occurred in 3 patients: in 4 months, in 12 months and in 6 months.  All of them were operated repeatedly.
After the surgery, hypoesthesia on the side of surgery was observed in all patients with a trend towards regression.
There was no keratopathy or any complications.
CONCLUSION
Percutaneous balloon compression of gasserian ganglion is an effective and minimally invasive method which can be performed repeatedly in patients with trigeminal neuralgia associated with MS.
