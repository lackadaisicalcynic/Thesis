[Endovascular treatment of acute mesenteric ischaemia in thrombosis of superior mesenteric artery].  The article deals with the problems related to acute impairment of mesenteric blood circulation, known as a nosological entity associated with an extremely high mortality rate.
The authors point out that there are currently no common approaches to appropriate management of the pathology concerned and define the role of modern minimally invasive methods, which roentgenosurgical interventions belong to, making it possible to rapidly, safely and efficiently cope with the problem of thrombosis of mesenteric vessels, as well as to decrease lethality and improve the prognosis in this cohort of patients.
Also presented herein is a detailed description of a clinical case report regarding successful endovascular treatment of a patient suffering from acute thrombosis of the superior mesenteric artery.
This is followed by assessing efficacy and safety of the method employed, and, finally, suggesting tactical solutions in treatment of patients presenting with acute pathology of mesenteric vessels.
