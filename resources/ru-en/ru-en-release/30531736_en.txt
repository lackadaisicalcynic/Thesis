AIM  To determine optimal terms of biliary decompression and bile reinfusion into gastrointestinal tract in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
179 medical records of patients with obstructive jaundice were analyzed to identify risk factors of postoperative complications.
Prospective research included bile examination in 34 patients with malignant obstructive jaundice.
New algorithm of preoperative management was proposed.
RESULTS
Hyperbilirubinemia over 50 μmol/l prior to radical surgery and 80 μmol/l before palliative surgery was followed by postoperative morbidity augmentation from 42.1% to 66.7% and from 11.1% to 37.5%, respectively.
Normal AST and ALT concentration after biliary decompression was noted after 13.63±2.39 days.
Total bilirubin level in the bile was the same within 5 days after external drainage and bile reinfusion into gastrointestinal tract after 1-2 day was associated with advanced intoxication.
New approach is associated with reduced postoperative morbidity from 37.9% to 26.5% (p<0.05) and mortality from 5.5% to 2.9%, respectively (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION
Duration of biliary decompression should be at least 13.63±2.39 days to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.
Bile reinfusion into gastrointestinal tract should be started in 5-6 days after decompression.
