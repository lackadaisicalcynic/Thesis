[Twin reversed arterial perfusion syndrome in the monochorionic diamniotic placenta with the development of an acardiac fetus].  The article describes an acardiac fetus in a patient with monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy with reversed arterial perfusion syndrome at 30 weeks' gestation.
It gives postmortem fetal computed tomographic and pathoanatomic data.
Microarray of acardiac fetal tissues revealed that there was deletion of chromosome 19 - arr [hg19] 19p13.3q11 (260,911-23,005,001) x1; size, 23 Mbp; the signal level in about 30% of fetal tissue cells containing deletion.
