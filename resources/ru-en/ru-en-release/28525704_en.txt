[Assessment methods risk of falls in people over age 65].  The aim of study was to investigate the effect of functional tests on the risk factors of falls in the elderly.
A prospective cohort study of 537 patients over 65 years using validated functional tests and hand dynamometer.
High speed gait (0,8 m / s and more) was observed in only 11,04 % of the elderly.
The best results of tests «Stand up from a chair five times» (<16,7 sec) and «Stand up and go» (10 to 12 sec) were observed in 42,86 % and 23.05 % of patients (p<0,01).
The worst performance observed over the age of 85 years.
The risk of falling is higher in men and women with low muscle strength (dynamometry) and worst test «Get up and go» (p<0,01).
Correlation relationship has been detected between dynamometry and functional tests with age, polymorbidity, polypharmacy, the frequency of falls and physical activity which are risk factors for falls in the elderly (p<0,05).
