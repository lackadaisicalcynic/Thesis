[Identification of the specific topographic features of the neck vessels for the prevention of bleedings during tonsillectomy].  The objective of the present work was to study syntopy of the large neck vessels in relation to the capsule of palatine tonsils with the use of the MRI technology.
A total of 109 patients (218 palatine tonsils) presenting with chronic tonsillitis were available for the examination including 64 women and 45 men at the age varying from 15 to 54 years.
All of them underwent MRI-guided vascular visualization in the paratonsillar region together with the measurements of the vessels extending to the capsule of the palatine tonsils at the level of the upper and lower poles, and also close to the mid-third of each palatine tonsil.
The distance from the external carotid artery to the upper and lower poles of the palatine tonsils was found to be 17.1±1.01 mm and 10.3±0.18 mm respectively and in the mid-third the palatine tonsil 10.7±0.12 mm; the distance from the internal carotid artery to the upper and low poles of the palatine tonsil amounted to 14.5±0.84 mm and 16.8±0.77 mm respectively while that to the mid-third of the palatine tonsil was 15.3±0.07 mm.
The branches of the external carotid artery feeding the palatine tonsils are the most frequent sources of bleedings; the following measurements were obtained: the maxillary artery 16.4±0.43 mm (17.4%) - the upper pole 9.6±0.02 mm (46.2%), the mid-third of the palatine tonsil 18.5±0.74 mm (29.5%) - the lower pole; the lingual artery 4.7±0.02 mm (6.8%) - the mid-third of the palatine tonsil, 6.2±0.82 mm (56.8%) - the lower pole; facial artery: 4.2±0.01 mm (0.76%) - the mid-third of the palatine tonsil; the occipital artery 25.6±0.12 mm (19%) - the upper pole; 14.8±0.11 mm (18.9%) - the mid-third of the palatine tonsil 9.56±0.12 mm (3.8%) - the lower pole; the tonsillar artery 1.88±0.01 mm (9.8%) - the upper pole; 2.51±0.01 mm (23%) - the mid-third of the palatine tonsil; 2.12±0.01 mm (11%) - the lower pole.
The distance from the internal jugular vein to the capsule of the palatine tonsils in the region of the upper pole of the palatine tonsil was 28.3±1.01 mm, in the lower pole region 26.6±1.54 mm, and in the region of the mid-third of the palatine tonsil 22.7±1.24 mm.
It is concluded that the results of the present study may be useful for the planning of the surgical strategy for the treatment of the patients presenting with chronic tonsillitis and for the prevention of hemorrhagic complications of tonsillectomy.
