[Syndrome dopamine dysregulation and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease].
AIM  Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) is a complication of the dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD); it is manifested as a compulsive medication use and may have negative impact on patients' social, psychological, and physical functioning.
An effect of deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus (DBS STN) on DDS is not fully understood.
Therefore, the degree of DDS during DBS STN in PD patients was evaluated in the study.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The main group included 15 patients with DDS symptoms in the preoperative period.  The comparison group consisted of 15 patients without DDS symptoms and the control group consisted of 15 patients who did not undergo surgery.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The severity of motor disturbances in the surgery groups has decreased significantly (by 45%).
Motor complications during DBS STN in patients with DDS have decreased by 50%; a decrease in the reduction of doses of dopaminergic preparations was noted as well.
