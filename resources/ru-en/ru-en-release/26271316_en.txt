[Cardiopulmonary bypass duration as predictor of immediate results after cardiac surgery].
It was analyzed the results of treatment of 152 patients who underwent heart valve surgery.  Depending on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration patients were divided into 4 groups: the 1st--up to 90 min, the 2nd--90-120 min, the 3rd--120-180 min, the 4th--more than 180 min. Severity of initial comorbidities was comparable in all groups.
It was revealed that CPB duration effects on intraoperative blood loss, incidence of acute renal failure, encephalopathy, use of inotropic and angiotonic support (p<0.05).
Accession of CPB duration was associated with increased number of postoperative complications in all groups (p<0.05).
"Critical periods" of CPB for every type of postoperative complications are defined.
