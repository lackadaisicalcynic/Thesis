[Experience with using cyanoacrylate glue in endovascular treatment of varicose veins].  The method of cyanoacrylate-mediated obliteration of subcutaneous veins is known to be an alternative to thermal endovascular obliteration and eliminates the need for tumescent anaesthesia.
This technique is based on glue-induced damage to the venous intima, followed by immune response according to the delayed-type hypersensitivity principle.
The authors report herein their first experience with using cyanoacrylate-mediated embolization in treatment of patients presenting with varicose veins.
The operation was carried out using the VenaSeal closure system (Medtronic).
Under ultrasonographic guidance, we performed cyanoacrylate-mediated obliteration of the trunk of the great saphenous vein, without tumescence.
The procedure turned out to be well tolerated, with no pain in the zone of cyanoacrylate obliteration reported by the patients in the postoperative period.
By means of ultrasonographic control carried out within 1-month of follow up we assessed obliteration of the vein, with the diameter of the obliterated portion amounting to 0.3-0.4 cm.
No phlebitis, allergic reactions, nor evidence of deep vein thrombosis were observed.
We also performed a morphological study of the removed suprafascial segment of the vein, containing the cyanoacrylate adhesive.
The obtained findings demonstrated detachment and destruction of the intima, swelling and loosening of the media, as well active degranulation of mast cells, thus making it possible to suppose the presence of toxic damage to the venous wall induced by cyanoacrylate glue.
Hence, the experience thus gained appears to be unequivocally suggestive of remarkable simplicity of performing cyanoacrylate-mediated embolization whose indisputable advantages include the painless nature of the procedure and no need for tumescent anaesthesia.
In order to assess efficacy and safety of this technique, further studies are required.
