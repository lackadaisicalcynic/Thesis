[Non-standard method of reconstruction of the abdominal aorta for a giant aneurysm].  Abdominal aortic aneurysms are encountered predominantly in elderly patients suffering from severe concomitant diseases.
Therefore, the rate of various complications associated with resection of aortic aneurysm amounts to 30%, with lethality in separate cohorts of patients reaching 43.7%.
According the authors' opinion, in the development of intra- and postoperative complications of special importance is the duration of aortic clamping accompanied by severe haemodynamic alterations in coronary, cerebral and renal vessels.
These changes are key moments in the development of fatal outcomes.
In order to reduce the duration of aortic clamp the authors suggested a non-standard surgical technique of prosthetic repair of the abdominal aorta.
Presented herein is a clinical case report illustrating this technique.
The patient operated on according to this technique was discharged in a satisfactory condition with no serious postoperative complications.
The proposed non-standard surgical technique makes it possible to reduce the duration of aortic cross-clamping in resection of an aneurysm by 10-12 minutes.
