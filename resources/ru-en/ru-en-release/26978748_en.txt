[The methodological approaches to the evaluation of the risk of developing pathology of the upper respiratory tract in the employees engaged in the dust-producing industries].
The objective of the present work was to develop the scientifically sound criteria for the evaluation of the occupational risks bearing in mind the high frequency of pathological changes in the ciliary epithelium of the upper respiratory tract in the employees engaged in the dust-producing industries.  It was proposed to consider an increase of the SIgA level, alkaline shift in nasal secretion pH, elevation of body temperature, slowdown of the mucociliary transport, disintegration of the epithelial mucous membrane, and high frequency of its inflammatory and dystrophic changes as the criteria for early diagnostics of developing pathology of the upper respiratory tract.
We have developed the method for the score-based evaluation of the risk of formation of pathological changes in the upper respiratory tract of the employees engaged in the dust-producing industries.  This method can be used to enhance the effectiveness of the preventive and health-promoting measures.
