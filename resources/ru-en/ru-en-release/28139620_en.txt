[Disturbance of body image in patients with meningiomas of parieto-occipital localization].
AIM  To study body image disturbances in patients with typical meningioma of parietal-occipital localization before and after surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Twenty-three patients with the diagnosis of «typical meningioma of parietal-occipital localization» were studied.
A battery of neuropsychological tests, dissociation methodology of «Image-I» and the method «Silhouette» were used.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The body schema disorders were found in patients with meningioma of parietal-occipital area.
There was the disturbance of the right-left orientation and position of body parts in space and in relation to each other as well as the disparity between the overall weight and height objective indicators and subjective perceptions of the body.  After surgery, the body orientation was significantly improved.
The distinct differentiation of the position of body parts relative to one another, adequate correlation between the position of two hands and unerring left-right orientation were seen.  Perceptions of the body became more adequate for the number of body parts and their size, but the person's own ideas about the constitution as a whole remained inadequate.
