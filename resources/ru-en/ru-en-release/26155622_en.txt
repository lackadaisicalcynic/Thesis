[Neurogenic copulative dysfunction in men: theoretical aspects, differential diagnosis, and rational therapy].  UNLABELLED
Neurogenic copulative dysfunction (CD) is observed in different diseases and injuries of both the central and peripheral nervous system.  CD concurrent with actual nervous system diseases has been established to be an important psychotraumatic factor that significantly reduces quality of life in these patients.
AIM  To investigate the effect of aminophenylbutyric acid (Noophen) on male copulative function.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Forty patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy on an exacerbation and mild and moderate closed head injury were examined.
RESULTS
The findings suggest that Noophen is effective in the combination therapy of neurogenic CD.
CONCLUSION
The drug can normalize an autonomic control over nerve centers involved in the regulation of copulative function, and improve the psychoemotional status of patients.
