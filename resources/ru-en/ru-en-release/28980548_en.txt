[The specific features of the blood stains on the water-lubricated surfaces].  The objective of the present study was the experimental investigation of the morphological characteristics of the 20 mcl blood droplets which freely fell down onto the surfaces that were either dry or moderately and profusely lubricated with water.
The morphological properties of the resulting blood stains on the glass surfaces, dry or moderately and profusely lubricated with water, are described.  The most characteristic features of such stains at the wet surface were the uneven serrated and stripe-like prominences, radial 'lucent stripes' passing into the splashing elements.
The size of the blood stains at the water-lubricated surface increased by 8-44%.
