From the oral cavity of healthy young people aged 18-22 years there were isolated 26 strains of lactobacilli, 28 streptococci, including the pathogenic and opportunistic strains, and 32 strains of staphylococci, 10 of which were methicillin-resistant S.aureus. Oral lactobacilli possessed by a high probiotic potential, showing high antagonism to methicillin-resistant staphylococci, pathogenic and opportunistic streptococci and enterococci.
Oral lactobacilli showed medium and high adhesive activity that determines their high adaptive capacity.
Staphylococci and streptococci in 90.3% of cases have not an antagonistic effect on lactobacilli.
Isolated lactobacilli can be used as probiotic strains for oral administration.
