[Lamin B1 and lamin B2 in human skin in the process of aging].  The aim of this work was to study B type lamins in human skin at different ages.
Lamins B1 and B2 were detected in sections of the skin by indirect immunohistochemistry.
There were 62,3 % of dermal fibroblasts with positive staining for lamin B1 at the period from 20 to 40 weeks of gestation.
From birth to 40 years, 41-42 % of fibroblasts containing lamin B1 were found in the dermis.
In age interval from 41 to 85 years, 57-60 % of dermal fibroblasts had a positive staining for lamin B1.
The number of fibroblasts containing lamin B2 was gradually decreased from 80,6 to 68,6 % from 20 weeks of gestation to 85 years old.
Expression of lamin B1 in the nuclei of fibroblasts was reduced from birth to 40 years old.  Content of lamin B2 in the nuclei of fibroblasts was almost constant from 20 weeks of gestation to 85 years old.
Number of fibroblasts in dermis was diminished with age.
The most significant decrease in the number of fibroblasts was observed from 20 weeks of gestation to 20 years old.
Results allow to suggest the participation of lamin B1 in triggering age-dependent decrease in the number of fibroblasts in the dermis in humans.
