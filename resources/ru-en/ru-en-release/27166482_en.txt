[The methods for the treatment and prevention of cicatrix stenoses of trachea].  The objective of the present study was to analyze the current literature concerning mechanisms underlying the development of tracheal stenosis, new methods for the treatment and prevention of this condition.
The main cause behind the formation of cicatrical stenosis of trachea is believed to be long-term artificial lung ventilation whereas the principal factors responsible for the injury to the tracheal wall include the impact of the cuff and the free end of the endotracheal tube, reflux of duodenal and gastric contents, concomitant infection, and the involvement of the autoimmune component.
These pathogenic factors produce morphological changes in all layers of the tracheal wall with the formation of the granulation tissue the appearance of which serves as a forerunner of irreversible changes leading to tracheal stenosis.
The biomedical technologies including auto- and allo-transplantation, tissue engineering, gene and cell-based therapy are considered to be the most promising methods for the treatment and prevention of this condition likely to improve the outcome of the management of cicatrical tracheal stenosis.
