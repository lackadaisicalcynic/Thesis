[Use of surgical approaches to the posterior cranial fossa in patients in a lying position].  BACKGROUND
Various suboccipital approaches are extensively used in modern neurosurgery for treatment of posterior cranial fossa disease.  The main patient's positions on the operating table during surgery are half-sitting and lying ones.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The article provides a detailed description and methodology of retrosigmoid suboccipital and median suboccipital approaches in a lying position.
CONCLUSION
The retrosigmoid suboccipital and median suboccipital approaches in a lying position, when used correctly, provide a good view of the operating field with the minimal risk of complications associated with the patient's position on the operating table.
