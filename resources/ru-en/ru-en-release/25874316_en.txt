[The determination of amitriptyline and its metabolite, nortriptyline, in the biological objects of the corpse by the high-performance liquid chromatography technique].
Tricyclic antidepressants are among the preparations that most frequently cause intoxication in adults and children; moreover, poisoning with these substances not infrequently has a fatal outcome.
Medications belonging to this group, such as amitriptyline, are extensively used to manage manifestations of depression, anxiety, migraine, neuropathic pain, and hyperactivity syndrome.
Amitriptyline overdosage causes non-specific symptoms of intoxication, and its clinical picture does not allow to identify the nature of a psychotropic xenobiotic.  Of primary importance in connection with this is to establish the cause of intoxication or death by the clinical toxicological and forensic medical methods based on the results of the fast identification and quantitation of amitriptyline in biological materials including blood, urine, hepatic tissues, etc.
The authors describe the method for the determination of amitriptyline and its principal physiological metabolite nortriptyline in biological objects with the help of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
