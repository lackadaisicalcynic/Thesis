[Mental health of elderly and old people when using a complete dry dental prosthesis: myth or reality?]  The study studied the ratio of 17 adults with complete loss of teeth and using complete removable acrylic dentures, to the disease, taking into account the degree of stability of dentures during chewing.
To determine the type of patient's attitude toward the disease, a clinical test method was used to determine the type of attitude towards the disease, in which the clinical-psychological typology of patients' attitude to 'illness' was realized, which provides the possibility of determining one of the twelve types of response.
It was found that when using complete removable dentures, regardless of age and sex, the types of attitude towards the disease were more often noted, with a marked disadaptive behavior with a predominantly intrapsychic orientation of the response to the disease, which was manifested by characteristic reactions such as irritable weakness, anxious, depressed, oppressed state.  The use of the cream to fix the removable dental prostheses Corega allowed to improve the stability of complete removable dentures, to eliminate the pronounced phenomena of mental disadaptation, and to create realistic treatment settings for patients, to help restore social ties.
