[Epidemiology of stroke in Irkutsk: the data of the territorial population register (2009-2013)].
AIM
To study the changes in the main epidemiological induces of stroke in Irkutsk over 2009-2013.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
To obtain significant epidemiological data, a unified method of territorial/population register was used.  Stroke morbidity and mortality among persons aged over 25 years is presented.
RESULTS
The highest indices of morbidity among men (5,6 per 1000 population) were recorded in 2010, among women (3,9 per 1000 population) in 2009.  Stroke morbidity decreased by 28% in women of Irkutsk over the 5-year period.
Indices of morbidity among men did not change during the period of the study and were higher compared to nationwide RESULTS: Mortality indices demonstrated a trend to a reduction: the mortality from stroke decreased by 2-fold over the 5 years.
CONCLUSION
The decrease in stroke mortality among men and women (both in Irkutsk and Russia in whole) is a logical consequence of a complex approach to the problem as well as opening of specialized vascular centers and secondary prevention of stroke.
