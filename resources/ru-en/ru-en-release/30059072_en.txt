[Inherited epidermolysis bullosa].
To summarize an update on epidermolysis bullosa as a polymorphic group of inherited diseases with a failure of epidermal-dermal integrity.  Emphasis is placed on the role of transmission electron microscopy in diagnosis and search directions for new types of the abnormality and its molecular markers.
Despite numerous mutations in the genes encoding the components of desmosomes and epithelial basement membrane, the stereotyped manifestations of pathological processes in the group of epidermolysis bullosa have been identified.  The paper gives a positive result of cell and gene therapies used by European scientists in the treatment of a 7-year-old child with borderline epidermolysis bullosa, which opens up new prospects for patients with butterfly disease that has long been considered fatal.
