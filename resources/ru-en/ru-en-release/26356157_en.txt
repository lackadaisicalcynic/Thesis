[The multicenter non-interventional, prospective observational program on the study of practical use of teraligen in patients diagnosed with autonomic disorder (START2): a local Russian experience with the use of the Russian version of The Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ).  An intermediate analysis].
AIM  To develop a new instrument able to identify pathological states and assess their changes during medication treatment.
We aimed to study the typical practice of using alimemazine (teraligen) in patients with the diagnosis of autonomic nervous system disorder and to test the Russian version of @The Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire@ (4DSQ) for measuring distress, depression, anxiety and somatization.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 3053 patients (mean age 42.09 Â± 11.71 years) who received teraligen in doses gradually increasing from 5 to 15 mg per day.  The observational program was carried out in over 600 outpatient clinics of the Russian Federation.
The 4DSQ was administered before treatment and 4 weeks after treatment.
The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale was used before, during (after 2 weeks) and after (4 weeks) treatment with teraligen.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  There was a significant improvement of patient's state assessed both by physicians (CGI scale) and by patients (96 and 98%, respectively).
The 4DSQ was sensitive to the parameters of response to treatment with teraligen: parameters obtained at baseline and 4 weeks after the beginning of treatment differed significantly demonstrating a significant decrease in distress, anxiety and somatization.
