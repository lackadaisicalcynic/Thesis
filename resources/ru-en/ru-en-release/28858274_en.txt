[Effectiveness of Paradontax toothpaste in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment].  The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of toothpaste Parodontax in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.
The results showed that fixed orthodontic appliances deteriorated oral hygiene, increased the viscosity of saliva and reduced mineralizing capacity of saliva (MCS).
Use of Parodontax toothpaste based on sodium bicarbonate improved OHI-S, reduced the viscosity of saliva, increased MCS and normalized oral microbiota.
