[The efficiency of antiviral therapy in patients with chronic -hepatitis C infected with hepatitis C virus recombinants].  The review gives the data available in the literature in the efficiency of treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C infected with hepatitis C virus.(HCV) recombinants, by applying various antiviral therapy regimens.
The low efficiency of treatment with- pegylated interferons (PEG IFN) + ribavirin (RIB) and sofosburin (SOF) +RIB in this patient group (a sustained virologic response was achieved in 22 and 30.7%, respectively) compared with the efficiency of treatment (87-97 and 83-97%, respectively) inpatients infected with HCV genotype 2 does not allow the 2015 EASL HCV genotype 2 treatment regimens to be used in. such patients.
In this connection, subtyping genotype 2 isolates by NS5B sequencing should be introduced into clinical laboratory practice to successfully detect recombinant HCVs and to enhance the efficiency of antiviral therapy.
