[Quality of life of patients with chronic cerebral ischemia].
AIM  To evaluate the effectiveness of soft techniques of manual therapy and correction of main indices of quality-of-life in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred patients with chronic cerebral ischemia were examined.
All patients received standard neurometabolic therapy.
In the main group, patients had additional sessions of soft manual therapy techniques.
Quality of life was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire on 20th day, and 3 and 6 month after treatment.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A significant decrease in the quality-of-life of patients with chronic cerebral ischemia was identified.
Quality-of-life has improved in patients who received neurometabolic therapy in the combination with soft techniques of manual therapy compared to the comparison group.
