[Effect of combined application of ozone therapy and gravitational therapy on the remote results of complex treatment of geriatric patients].  The article presents the remote results of treatment of an obliterating atherosclerosis of arteries of the lower extremities of the II stage at patients of advanced and senile age after the combined use of ozone therapy and gravitational therapy.
We performed a prospective randomized study in three parallel groups (139 patients).  The 1st group (n=57) received standard medical therapy in combination with ozone therapy; the group was divided into two subgroups: for patients of subgroup 1a (n=28) - intravenous ozonized physiological solution was performed, for patients of subgroup 1b (n=29) - major ozonized autohemotherapy.
For patients of the 2nd group (n=62) - a comprehensive treatment, including gravitational therapy in addition to medical ozone, was carried out.  In this group were also identified two subgroups: subgroup 2a (n=31) - patients received standard medical therapy in combination with ozonized physiological solution and gravitational therapy, subgroup 2b (n=31) - standard medical therapy in conjunction with major ozonized autohemotherapy and gravitational therapy.
The 3rd control group (n=20) included patients, who received only standard medical therapy.
Dynamics of changes of a stage of a disease and the number of surgeries in the remote period was estimated (up to 7 years).
After 6 months of follow-on stages of the distribution of the disease patients significantly (p>0,05) did not differ from the initial amount.
Analysis of survival and probable risk at 7 years of follow-Cox regression method revealed a maximum efficiency in the subgroup 2a where the risk of probability of surgeries and also increases in a stage of a disease effectively decreased.
