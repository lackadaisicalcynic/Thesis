[Otomycosis: the modern view of etiology and management].  This article deals with the modern approaches to the diagnostics and treatment of fungal ear infection depending on the localization of the inflammatory process and the species of the causative fungal agent with special reference to the factors underlying the development of otomycosis under the present-day conditions based on the results of the analysis of the studies carried out during the period from 2010 to 2014.
The materials of the examination of 2152 patients who applied for the medical care to various clinical departments of the Institute and were found to present with chronic inflammatory ear pathology were available for the analysis.
Fungal lesions were diagnosed in 495 (23%) patients with this condition.  Fungal lesions of the external ear were the predominant form of pathology; they were documented in 331 (67%) patients.
Fungal otitis media was diagnosed in 85 (17%) patients and fungal lesions of the postoperative cavity in 79 (16%) patients suffering from otomycosis.
65% of the patients presenting with external fungal otitis, 20% of those with fungal otitis media, and 95% of the patients with inflammation of the postoperative cavity were infected with mold fungi dominated by the genus Aspergillus spp.  79 (16%) patients suffering from otomycosis.
In 35% of the patients presenting with fungal external otitis, 80% of those with fungal otitis media, and 5% of the patients with inflammation of the postoperative cavity of the middle ear, the causative agents of the disease were the fungi Candida spp.
The authors describe the modern schemes for the treatment of otomycosis elaborated at the L.I. Sverzhevskiy Research Institute of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology.
