[The use of buspirone in clinical practice].
Buspirone, a nonbenzodiasepine anxiolytic, is a partial serotonin 5-HT1A-receptor agonist, D2-autoreceptor antagonist and low affinity 5-HT2-receptor agonist.  This medication is used for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder though it may be prescribed in other anxiety states, primarily, panic disorder, sociophobia and depression.
Buspirone seems to be potential in treatment of other neurological and mental disorders (tardive dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease, ataxia, behavioral disorders, cranial/brain injuries, dementia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder).
