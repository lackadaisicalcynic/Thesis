[A clinical observation of an extensive chondroma of oro- and laryngopharynx].
This article was designed to report a rare case of oropharyngeal chondroma in a 31 year-old male patient.  Computed tomography revealed an encapsulated cystic-solid tissue mass having the clear-cut contours with multiple diffuse foci of calcification in the tissue thickness.
The neoplasm was morphologically characterized as a chondroma.
The tumour was removed with the use of the modified Lauers-Balon procedure with the dissection of the lower jaw.
