Point-of-care HIV tests done by peers, Brazil.
PROBLEM
Early diagnosis of infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is needed - especially among key populations such as sex workers, transgender people, men who have sex with men and people who use drugs.
APPROACH
The Brazilian Ministry of Health developed a strategy called Viva Melhor Sabendo ("live better knowing") to increase HIV testing among key populations.  In partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), a peer point-of-care testing intervention, using an oral fluid rapid test, was introduced at social venues for key populations at different times of the day.
LOCAL SETTING
Key populations in Brazil can have 40 times higher HIV prevalence than the general population (14.8% versus 0.4%).  RELEVANT CHANGES
Legislation was reinterpreted, so that oral fluid rapid tests could be administered by any person trained in rapid testing by the health ministry.
Between January 2014 and March 2015, 29â€‰723 oral fluid tests were administered; 791 (2.7%) were positive.  Among the key populations, transgender people had the greatest proportion of positive results (10.7%; 172/1612), followed by men who declared themselves as commercial sex workers (8.7%; 165/1889) and men who have sex with men (4.8%; 292/6055).
LESSONS LEARNT
The strategy improved access to HIV testing.  Testing done by peers at times and locations suitable for key populations increased acceptance of testing.
Working with relevant NGOs is a useful approach when reaching out to these key populations.
