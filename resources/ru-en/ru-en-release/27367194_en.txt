[The state of brachiocephalic artery endothelium in individuals with inflammatory periodontal disease and different cardiovascular risks].
The study included 35 patients (19 men and 16 women, aged 35 to 65 years) with chronic generalized severe periodontitis and atherosclerosis of the brachiocephalic artery (BCA).
The changes of the BCA tone were evaluated by ultrasonic duplex scanning before and after transient limb ischemia created by endothelium-dependent vasodilation at baseline and at different laps after the anti-inflammatory and surgical treatment.
The size of atherosclerotic plaques before and after the treatment was measured.  In the early stages of treatment there were no changes of the tone of the brachial artery.
The long-term results after conservative treatment also showed no changes but 6 months after surgical treatment in all patients the study showed the improved of the brachial artery tone on average 3-4% and a slight tendency to decrease of the atherosclerotic plaque.
