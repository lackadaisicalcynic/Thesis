[Efficacy of intramuscular administration of stem/progenitor cells in experiment on the model of lower limb ischaemia].  An experimental model of lower limb ischaemia induced by ligation of the femoral artery in CBA-line mail rats was used to study efficacy and effect of intramuscular administration of autologous bone-marrow stem/progenitor cells on the process of angiogenesis.
Based on the findings of laser Doppler flowmetry it was shown that administration of autologous stem/progenitor cells promotes acceleration of the processes of neoangiogenesis, which was confirmed by the results of histological study.
