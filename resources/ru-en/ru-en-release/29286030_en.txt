[Urgent surgical care for patients with colon cancer complicated by hemorrhage].
AIM
To evaluate an effectiveness of various hemostatic methods in patients with colon and rectal cancer.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
77 urgent patients with colon and rectal cancer complicated by bleeding were enrolled.  Medication was effective in 11 patients (group 1), endoscopic hemostasis in 47 patients (group 2), vascular embolization in 2 cases (group 3), internal iliac arteries ligation in 2 patients (group 4), 15 patients underwent emergency resection (group 5).
Twenty out of 62 patients in groups 1-4 underwent elective radical procedures and radio- or chemotherapy in 7-10 days after hemostasis and normalization of hemoglobin.
3-year Kaplan-Meier survival was assessed after emergency (group 5) and elective surgery (groups 1-4) in 31 patients.
RESULTS
Effectiveness of various hemostatic methods was 14.3% in group 1, 79.7% in group 2, 28.6% in group 3 and 100% in groups 4 and 5.
Postoperative morbidity and mortality were higher after emergency (group 5) compared with elective (groups 1-4) procedures: 33.3 and 20%; 15 and 5% respectively.
3-year survival was better after elective than emergency operations - 0.78 and 0.57, respectively.
CONCLUSION
Management of bleeding should be carried out by highly qualified specialist at multi-field emergency care hospital.
Endoscopy and arterial embolization are the most effective methods of hemostasis with minimal risk of complications.
In hemorrhage patients endoscopy and embolization ("bridge to surgery") are an alternative to conditionally radical operations, since they allow to reduce mortality.
