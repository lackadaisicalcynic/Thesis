[Effectiveness of biological prosthesis for femoro-femoral bypass in high risk patients].  AIM
To compare synthetic and biological prostheses for femoral bypass surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  There were 40 patients with critical ischemia of lower extremities due to atherosclerotic lesion of aorto-iliac segment and severe comorbidities.
They were divided into 2 groups by 20 patients.
C-shaped femoro-femoral bypass with synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene and lavsan prostheses was performed in the first group and S-shaped bypass procedure with biological prosthesis from the internal thoracic arteries of the bull - in the second group.
RESULTS
Biological prosthesis is associated with reduced early postoperative morbidity by 10%, late graft thrombosis incidence by 20% and increased physical and psychological health by 7.1%.
CONCLUSION
S-shaped femoro-femoral bypass with a biological prosthesis from the internal thoracic arteries of the bull is pathogenetically substantiated and effective.
