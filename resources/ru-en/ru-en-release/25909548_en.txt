[Endoscopic transpapillary interventions in diagnostics and treatment of patients with diseases of the pancreatobiliary area].  It was performed analysis of efficiency of endoscopic retrograde transpapillary interventions in diagnostics and treatment of 1513 patients with diseases of the pancreatobiliary area for the period 2008--2012.
Associated diseases confirmed or first identified during transpapillary intervention (stricture + choledocholithiasis, cancer + choledocholithiasis, etc.) were revealed in 6.8% of patients.  We used almost all types of endoscopic transpapillary techniques which are applies for biliary hypertension including retrograde cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic papillotomy, endoscopic mechanical lithoextraction and lithotripsy, nasobiliary drainage, bougienage, balloon dilatation, stenting and endoscopic contact electrohydraulic lithotripsy of calculus of common bile duct.
Efficiency of endoscopic transpapillary interventions was 96.5%.  Complications were observed in 4.3% of patients.
