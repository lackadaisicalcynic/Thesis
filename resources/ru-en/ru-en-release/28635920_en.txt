[Myocardial injury associated with chronic hepatitis C: Clinical types and pathogenetic components].
Heart injury is one of the extrahepatic manifestations of chronic hepatitis C (CHC).
The paper gives Russian and foreign authors' data on a relationship between CHC and myocardial injury.  It discusses different pathogenetic components (the direct effect of the virus, immunological components), through which hepatitis C virus can induce myocarditis and cardiomyopathies in patients with CHC.
