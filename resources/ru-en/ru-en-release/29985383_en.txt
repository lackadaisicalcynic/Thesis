[The pilot studies for the development of the combined methods of rehabilitation of the patients as exemplified by the application of phyto- and physiotherapeutic modalities].
Under the modern market conditions, the process of development of the methods for the combined rehabilitation of the patients is becoming increasingly more complicated.  For the reduction of potential risks and leveling the factors responsible for the uncertain market situation influencing the creation of new methods, it is necessary to carry out the full-scale pilot studies with the use of the marketing analysis methods.
The objective of the present work was to create and elaborate the rationale for the graphological structure (the scheme) of the process of exploratory research with a view to the development of the combined rehabilitation methods as exemplified by phyto- and physiotherapeutic modalities.
The work is based on the application of the existing approaches to the structural, comparative, systemic, and situational analyses.
The proposed graphological structure (scheme) of the exploratory research process consists of 6 stages.
Its distinctive features are as follows: a fractional stage by stage evaluation of a variety of issues including the study of physical factors, characteristic of the means of herbal medicine with special reference to the mechanisms of their production and application under the current market conditions, monitoring the marketing environment with the constant focus on the trends and behavior of the target market, the parallel pursuing of serial studies with the application of the iterative procedures; the use of the previously created data bank to expand medical services at the stages of development and maturation of the life cycle, the evaluation of the possibility of establishment of the industry of parapharmaceutical products.
