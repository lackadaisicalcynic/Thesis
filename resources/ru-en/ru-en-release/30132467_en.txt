[Modern aspects of antiepileptic therapy during pregnancy].  This review of literature is devoted to contemporary issues of antiepileptic therapy in pregnancy, with identifying the most effective drug according to publications from 2006 to 2016 (PUBMED, MEDline, The Cochrane Lb.).
The review presents the current published data on the incidence of seizures in pregnant women, specificity of therapy with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), frequency of fetal malformations in pregnant women taking AEDs regularly and their dependence on the frequency, dosage and nature of therapy.
The authors studied and analyzed the literature on antiepileptic therapy with AED for the last ten years and selected AED with the least teratogenic effect and less side-effects.
Lamotrigine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenobarbital were studied.  In addition to classic AEDs, new AEDs (vigabatrin, gabapentin, topiramate, tiagabine, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, pregabalin) were investigated.
Over the past decade, the use of new-generation AEDs has increased.
It has been found that the risk of birth defects in children is associated with high doses of drugs and polytherapy compared to monotherapy.
New data of recent studies showed the effect of psychotropic drugs on the fetus allowing to assess the 'risk/benefit' ratio and develop recommendations on rational pharmacotherapy of epilepsy in pregnancy.
