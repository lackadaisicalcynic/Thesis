[Cardiopulmonary bypass in thoracic surgery].  AIM
To analyze advisability of cardiopulmonary bypass in thoracic surgery.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We estimated early and long-term results of CPB-assisted thoracic interventions in 31 patients with malignant and benign thoracic diseases and invasion into vital mediastinal structures or with concomitant cardiovascular pathology.  RESULTS
Acceptable rates of mortality and morbidity confirm safety of CPB in thoracic surgery while satisfactory long-term outcomes are arguments in favor of this direction of thoracic oncology.
