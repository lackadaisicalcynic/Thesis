[Molecular methods in diagnosis of poorly differentiated malignant brain tumors in children].  The histological diagnosis of malignant brain tumors in children is a complex process.
In some cases, glioblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the central nervous system, and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor have a histological type similar to that of small blue round cell malignant tumor.  Despite the similar histology, biological properties and approaches to treatment, these neoplasms are completely different and require their own treatment protocols.
We retrospectively reviewed the most malignant types of childhood tumors and analyzed our own experience to propose a diagnostic algorithm for intracerebral small blue round cell malignant tumors in children based on the use of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization.
