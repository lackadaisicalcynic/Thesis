[Preferable surgery for benign tumors of the adrenal glands].  AIM
To determine optimal surgical approach in patients with adrenal tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Overall experience of treatment of patients with adrenal tumors comprises over 300 procedures including 152 minimally invasive surgeries.
RESULTS
We have presented the advantages and relative disadvantages of various technologies which are useful to be considered to determine the most optimal surgery in these patients.  CONCLUSION
There are no serious contradictions to use existing surgical methods in patients with adrenal tumors.  Minimally invasive procedures along with conventional (open) interventions significantly enlarged rational choice in surgery for adrenal neoplasms and optimized personified approach.
