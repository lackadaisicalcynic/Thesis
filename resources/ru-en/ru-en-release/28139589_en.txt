[Analysis of comprehensive treatment of oral leukoplakia by laser ablation].
The article presents data statistics of surgical treatment of leukoplakia by laser ablation for 2014 were examined and operated on 12 patients with verrucous and erosive forms of leukoplakia of the oral mucosa using a diode laser.
Only 5 (42%) showed positive results in 7 (58%) patients had recurrent disease, often in the localization of the lesion on the tongue.
It is possible that relapse may be associated with incomplete excision of the lesion due to anatomical and morphological features of the oral mucosa in various topographical areas.
The study emphasizes the need to find alternative methods of modern surgical excision, one of which can be radiofrequency excision.
