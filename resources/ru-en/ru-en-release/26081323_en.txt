[Depression comorbid to ischemic heart disease: a psychometric and molecular-genetic study].  OBJECTIVE
To compare psychometric and molecular-genetic characteristics of depression caused by ischemic heart disease (IHD) and depression in patients with IHD caused by other psychogenic factors.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and thirty-five patients with depression comorbid to ischemic heart disease (IHD) were examined.  Depression was associated with IHD in 71 patients (group 1).
In 64 patients, depression was caused by other psychogenic factors (group 2).  The HAMD-21 scale was used to measure depressive symptoms.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The comparative analysis of the core symptoms of depression demonstrated that group 1 had a peculiar psychometric profile with marked apathy, which was not accompanied by marked hypothymia, guilt feelings or anxiety, compared to group 2.
The molecular-genetic correlate of this profile was found.
It included a combination of an allele S (5-HTTLPR) of the serotonin transporter gene, an allele G (A-1438G) of the serotonin receptor type 2A gene and the genotype ValVal (Val66Met) of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene.
