[Clinical/epidemiological characteristics of ischemic stroke in Dagestan].
OBJETIVE  To analyze risk factors and course of acute ischemic stroke (IS) based on hospital register data.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ninety-seven patients (38 women and 59 men, mean age 65.4±12.8 and 61.2±18.8 years, respectively) with acute IS admitted in 2016 to the Clinical hospital of Makhachkala were examined.
Medical history and severity of neurological deficit (the British Medical Council Scale, The Glasgow Coma Scale, MMSE) were assessed.
RESULTS
The severity of neurological deficit was comparable in men and women though cognitive impairment was more frequent in women (p<0.05).
At admission, symptoms of inflammation and hyper coagulation were more frequently identified in women (p<0.05).
The high prevalence of chronic cerebral ischemia preceding IS, insufficient efficacy of preventive treatment and late hospitalization were noted.
CONCLUSION
The results should be confirmed in a large-scale long-term study.  They can be used to improve quality of medical care of patients with IS.
