[Developing the optimal protocol for balloon dacryoplasty].  AIM
To develop the optimal protocol for balloon dacryoplasty (DCP) through an experiment.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The experiment enrolled 12 Chinchilla rabbits (24 eyes).
DCP protocol for group 1 (5 rabbits, 10 eyes) implied two dilations of 90 and 60 sec followed by another two of the same duration, while in group 2 (5 rabbits, 10 eyes) all four dilations were of 90 sec.
The balloon was moved proximally before the every third dilation.
The remaining 2 rabbits (4 eyes) who did not receive balloon DCP constituted the control group.
The animals were killed on days 1, 3, 7, and 14.  In all cases nasolacrimal duct morphology was studied.
RESULTS
By day 14 after the procedure, inflammatory changes in nasolacrimal ducts either had resolved (protocol 1) or persisted (protocol 2).
