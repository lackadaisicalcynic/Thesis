[Bone anchored auricular prosthesis for patients with grade III microtia].  The aim of the study was to assess the effectivity of auricular prosthesis on intraosseous implants in patient with grade III microtia.
The study included 7 patients (5 males and 2 females) aged 18 to 45 years with hemifacial microsomia and grade III microtia operated in Central Research Institute of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery in 2013-2016.
Number and position of intraosseous implants was determined by reverse planning based on CT representing hard and soft facial structures.
Patients were followed-up for 6-36 months.  Good esthetic results were obtained by minimally invasive surgical procedure and short post-op rehabilitation.
However these results required meticulous virtual planning and manufacturing of surgical template.  The described method promotes very fast medical and social rehabilitation of patients with severe microtia.
