[Conceptual approach to classification of implant supported prosthesis for edentulous patients].
The aim of this study was the creation of a conceptual model of the standard implant prosthetics for edentulous patients using the data of comprehensive examination and implantation prosthetics in 372 patients aged 38 to 80 years (201 women, 171 men) with 582 implant supported prosthesis of various types, supporting on implants «Nobel Replace Select/Groove» and «Nobel Speedy Groove» (3675 implants).
Clinical classification of implant-supported prosthesis for edentulous patients included 5 classes: class 1 (1-2 implants) included 6.2% of implant supported prosthesis, class 2 (3-4 implant) - 19.2% of prostheses, class 3 (5-6 implants) - 30.2% of replacement structures; IV (7-10 implants) - 44%, and V - 0,3%.
Restoration class was age-dependent.
