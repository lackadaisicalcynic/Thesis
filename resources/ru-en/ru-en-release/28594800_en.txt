[Results of administering oral anticoagulants for treatment of patients with venous thromboembolic complications].  The objective of the study was to compare safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban and dabigatran with warfarin in treatment of patients with acute venous thromboembolic complications (VTEC).
The authors analysed the results of examining and treating a total of 95 patients presenting with VTEC and randomly divided into three groups.
In all groups the initial anticoagulant therapy consisted in unfractionated heparin administered for 5 days, after which the patients followed by switching were switched to a 6-month course of treatment with oral anticoagulants.
Patients from Group One received warfarin, Group Two patients were treated with dabigatran etexilate, and Group Three patients were treated with rivaroxaban.
Relapses of the disease were diagnosed in 2 (5.7%) patients from Group One.
Haemorrhagic complications were noted in 8 (22.9%) Group One patients, in 3 (10%) Group Two patients and in 2 (6.7%) Group Three patients.
After the end of treatment, complete recanalization of the thrombosed veins was revealed 13 (37.1%) patients from Group One, in 15 (50%) patients from Group Two and in 14 (46.7%) patients from Group Three.
One year after the end of treatment, freedom from chronic venous insufficiency was observed in 8 (23.3%) patients of Group One, in 12 (40%) patients of Group Two and in 11 (36.6%) patients of Group Three.
The composite quality of life indices after the treatment course were (appeared to be) higher in Group Two and Three patients compared with those of Group One.
Hence, a conclusion was drawn that dabigatran and rivaroxaban turned out to be superior by efficacy and safety to warfarin in treatment of this patient cohort.
No statistically significant differences were observed while comparing dabigatran and rivaroxaban.
