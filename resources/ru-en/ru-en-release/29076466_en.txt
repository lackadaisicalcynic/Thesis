[A supraorbital trans-eyebrow approach in surgery of chiasmatic-sellar and anterior cranial fossa tumors].  OBJECTIVE  to analyze 31 resections of chiasmatic-sellar region (CSR) and anterior cranial fossa (ACF) tumors using the supraorbital trans-eyebrow approach (STA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We analyzed medical histories of 31 patients who underwent tumor resection using STA in the period between October 2013 and April 2017.
We analyzed the age and gender of patients, size and location of the tumor, presence of a neurological deficit, vision and olfactory functions before and after surgery, surgery duration, amount of intraoperative blood loss, rate of frontal sinus trephination and nasal liquorrhea, hemorrhagic and ischemic complications after surgery, Simpson grade of tumor resection, patient's condition before and after surgery (Glasgow Outcome Scale and Karnofsky Scale), and degree of patient satisfaction with the cosmetic result of surgery.
A total of 26 meningiomas (20 sphenoid plate, tubercle, and diaphragm tumors, 3 lesser sphenoid wing meningiomas, 2 orbital roof tumors, and 1 anterior clinoid process meningioma), 3 frontal lobe gliomas, and 2 pituitary adenomas were resected.
RESULTS
In all 31 operations, the approach was adequate and enabled tumor resection without lethal outcomes.
The mean surgery duration was 174.6±64.4 min.
The mean blood loss was 190±96.6 mL (50-380 mL).
After surgery, none of the patients developed motor deficits and new epileptic seizures.
Neurological deficit aggravation in the form of impaired vision and mental disorders occurred in 8 (25.8%) patients.
Vision impaired in 4 (12.9%) patients, improved in 6 (19.3%) patients, and remained unchanged in 21 (67.7%) patients.
An endocrinological deficit in the form of partial hypopituitarism developed in 3 (9.6%) patients; in 4 (12.9%) patients, there were mental disorders that regressed by the end of the first month of therapy.
There were no intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages.
In 2 (6.4%) patients, small epidural hematomas were diagnosed, which did not require surgical treatment.
There were only good outcomes (a GOS score of 4 or 5).
After surgery, the median Karnofsky index in the STA group was 90±7.
In all 31 (100%) patients, the postoperative wound healed by primary intention, without infectious complications and wound liquorrhea.
One (4%) patient developed eyebrow palsy; 3 (12%) patients had hypoesthesia in the supraorbital region.
The mean VAS score of patient satisfaction with the cosmetic result was 9.36 (median 10±1).
The mean follow-up period was 16.2±13.5 months (2-38 months).
CONCLUSION
The STA is adequate for removal of CSR and ACF tumors under proper selection of patients.
It provides an adequate view of anatomical structures and enables successful tumor resection through a less traumatic access.
