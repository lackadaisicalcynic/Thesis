[Discontinuity of the annuity curves.  II. Variability of annuity curves in Drosophila melanogaster Canton S strain].
We analyzed «five phase» structure of Drosophila melanogaster annuity curves described earlier.  It did not depend on the sample size and seemed to be stable.
We argue that: 1. there must be strict determination of «five phase» structure; 2. variability of its duration, may be induced by weak unknown signals.
