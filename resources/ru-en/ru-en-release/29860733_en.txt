[Pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-thyroid axis hormone serum levels in postmenopausal women of the European North of the Russian Federation, depending on the age.]  Using the methods of radioimmunoassay and enzyme immunoassay there were studied the levels of hormones of the pituitary-thyroid and pituitary-gonadal systems in the postmenopausal women of the European North of the Russian Federation in the second period of mature age, elderly and senile ages.
The lower concentrations of total and free fractions of triiodothyronine and total thyroxin, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and estradiol were noted in the blood of investigated women in the senile age.
Excess levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone were shown in 12,1% of people in the II period of mature age and 17,4% of people in the elderly age.
The examined women showed signs of androgenization, manifested by elevated values of luteinizing hormone, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.  The levels of luteinizing hormone exceed the norm in 50% of persons of the second period of mature age, 18,2% of the elderly and 26,1% of the persons of senile age.
The concentrations of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate exceed the norms established for the postmenopausal period in 15,4 and 91,7% of persons in the second period of mature age and in 11,4 of 84,2% of the elderly age.
The greatest number of correlation interrelations of the studied hormones levels was noted in senile age.
