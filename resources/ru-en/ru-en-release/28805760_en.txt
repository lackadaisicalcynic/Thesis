[Mapping of motor-points in the flexor muscles of the arm for the optimization of botulinum toxin injections in treatment of spasticity].
AIM
To study the location and verification of motor points (MP) of the upper limbs for targeting botulinum toxin (BT) type A injections in the treatment of spasticity.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Twenty healthy people were examined.
Using electromyography a complete study of the muscles of the upper limbs was conducted.  RESULTS
Anatomical localization of MP was performed.  The location of MP is identical and does not depend on sex, age and the dominant limb.
Tables and maps of MP locations are presented.
CONCLUSION
MP in the flexor muscles of the arm were identified.  A surface map with MP location was created.
This data may improve the clinical efficacy and feasibility of MP targeting, when injecting BT in spasticity.
