[The extended endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach in surgery for epidermoid cysts of the chiasmatic region].
Surgical treatment for epidermoid cysts of the chiasmatic region is a challenge because of the tendency to a massive spread of epidermoid masses through the cerebrospinal fluid pathways and a significant lesion deviation from the midline.
PURPOSE  To analyze capabilities of the extended endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach in surgery for epidermoid cysts.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 6 patients with epidermoid cysts of the chiasmatic region who were operated on using the extended anterior endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute in the past 5 years.
RESULTS  Epidermoid masses were completely removed in 5 patients; in none of the cases, complete removal of the epidermoid cyst capsule was achieved.
There were no cases of vision deterioration and the development of new focal neurological symptoms.
One female patient developed hypopituitary disorders in the postoperative period.  There was no recurrence of epidermoid cysts during follow-up.
CONCLUSION
Removal of epidermoid cysts of the chiasmatic region using the extended anterior endoscopic transsphenoidal approach may be an alternative to transcranial microsurgery.
