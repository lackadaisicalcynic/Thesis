[Current prerequisites for a molecular genetic classification of endometrial cancer].  The review analyzes current investigators' data on the introduction of an additional endometrial cancer classification based on the results of molecular and genetic studies.
This necessity is dictated by clinical observations, according to which the genetic profile of the tumors may not correspond to their morphological structure, which considerably changes patient management tactics.
The existing dualistic model of carcinogenesis makes it possible to identify and describe the characteristic molecular features of the tumors in terms of their histological structure.
The review also analyzes the concept of 4 new endometrial cancer subgroups: ultramutated, hypermutated, copy-number low, and copy-number high (serous-like).
It gives the results of investigations of the molecular and genetic characteristics of each subgroup.
Particular attention is paid to the role of POLE gene mutations in the ultramutated subgroup.
Different theories justifying a good prognosis in these patients are considered.
The molecular characteristics of endometrial cancer versus tumors of other organs are compared.
The potential benefits of introducing the new classification, which allow one to change approaches to stratifying the risk for this disease, are presented.
