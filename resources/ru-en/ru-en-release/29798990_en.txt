AIM  To evaluate the effectiveness of complex preoperative diagnostics and medication of intussusception followed by intestinal obstruction in adults with the choice of surgical repair and analysis of the outcomes depending on the causes of intussusception.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
15 intussusception patients aged 19 - 86 years were enrolled.
Mean age was 52.7 years.
Patients were hospitalized within 12 hours - 1-2 weeks after onset of the disease.
Diagnosis was established on the basis of complaints, anamnesis, objective and additional survey.
All patients underwent abdominal X-ray and ultrasound.
Intestinal obstruction at admission was diagnosed in all patients, and only 1 (6.7%) of them had intussusception.
RESULTS
Medication and additional survey contributed to detection of intussusception followed by intestinal obstruction in 13 (86.7%) out of 15 patients prior to surgery.
All patients underwent urgent or delayed surgery.
Small intestine resection was performed in 9 patients, 2 patients underwent resection of small intestine with submucosal tumor (1) and Meckel's diverticulum (1) after intussusception repair.
Right-sided hemicolectomy was performed in 3 patients, sigmoid colon resection with lymph nodes dissection - in 1 patient.
The cause of intussusception followed by intestinal obstruction were epithelial and stromal tumors (9), less often metastasis of melanoma (2), Meckel's diverticulum (1) and functional bowel disorders (1).
Postoperative complications arose in high risk patients hospitalized after 24 hours from onset of the disease and present concomitant diseases and malignancies.
1 (6,7%) patient died.
