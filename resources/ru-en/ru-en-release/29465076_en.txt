[The study results of the alveolar ridge mucosal microcirculation after bone augmentation using the Tunnel Technique method].
It reports the results of primary basal blood flow in partially edentulous bone tissue with atrophy, as well as comparative evaluation of haemomicrocirculation level of the alveolar bone mucosa after bone augmentation via tunneling and conventional methods.  The results of the initial state of microcirculation in the mucous membrane of the alveolar process in the partially edentulous area show a 45% decrease of blood flow (M), its intensity (s) by 60%.
Microcirculatory shifts in blood flow levels indicators, its intensity, vasomotor activity are more evident when using the conventional method, where revascularization takes more than five months.
When using the tunnel method, there is an improvement in haemodynamic mechanisms of tissue blood flow regulation.  Microcirculation is restored 4 months after surgery.
