[Orbital case of ocular dirofilariasis].
AIM
to report a clinical case of orbital dirofilariasis with attention to peculiarities of disease presentation, diagnostic measures, and treatment results.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A patient with a history of spontaneously subsiding recurrent oedema of the lower eyelid suspicious of parasitic cyst formation.
The diagnosis was confirmed preoperatively by orbital ultrasound.  Surgical intervention included orbitotomy with microsurgical excision of the parasitic cyst via a percutaneous approach through the lower eyelid skin crease.
RESULTS
Ultrasonography of the orbits appeared to be the most informative diagnostic method in this case.
Thorough surgical planning allowed us to avoid complications in the postoperative period and to achieve good cosmetic results.
CONCLUSION
A painless solid mass lesion with recurrent perifocal oedema and hyperaemia without inflammatory infiltration of surrounding tissues is characteristic of parasitic cysts of the orbit.
Amond other infectious diseases, a parasitic cyst stands out for symptomatic relapses and spontaneous regression, irrespective of the treatment received.
The use of ultrasound allowed preoperative identification of the sac and the living helminth.
