[Evaluating an effectiveness of surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease combined with hiatal hernia].
AIM
To assess an effectiveness of surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) combined with hiatal hernia (HH).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The trial included 96 patients with GERD and HH who were divided into 2 groups.  The principal difference between groups was the use of surgery in the main group and therapeutic treatment in the comparison group.
RESULTS
The effectiveness of surgical treatment is superior to therapeutic treatment of GERD by more than 2.5 times.
CONCLUSION
HH combined with GERD is an indication for surgical treatment.  Fundoplication cuff should not lead to angular and rotational esophageal deformation.
Nissen procedure in Donahue modification (Short Floppy Nissen) simulates optimally the geometry of esophago-gastric junction and His angle.
