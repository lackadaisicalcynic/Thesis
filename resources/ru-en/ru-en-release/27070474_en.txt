[Neurotrophic peptides of —Åerebrolysin as a basis for anticonvulsant effect of the drug].
AIM  To study an effect of cerebrolysin on the expression and severity of primary-generalized seizures caused by thiosemicarbazide and to analyze the corresponding molecular mechanisms.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The effects of cerebrolysin were studied on the thiosemicarbazide model of convulsions in 144 male rats.
Cerebrolysin was introduced intraperitoneally in the dose of 2.5 ml/kg of body mass 5 days a week during 18 days.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Cerebrolysin reduces the severity and duration of seizures caused by thiosemicarbazide and increases the survival rate of animals.
Cerebrolysin potentiates the anticonvulsant action of gabapentin and sodium valproate.
Neurohistological analysis has shown that the thiosemicarbazide model results in the ischemic brain damage.
Cerebrolysin substantially minimizes the ischemic injury of neurocytes induced by thiosemicarbazide and contributes to the restoration of brain tissue morphology.
