[Features of the new minimally invasive techniques facet fixation system «Facet Wedge» in the treatment of degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine in elderly patients.]  The aim of the study was a comparative analysis of the clinical and radiographic effectiveness of the use of interbody fusion and open pedicle screw stabilization of simultaneous and new minimally invasive techniques facet fixation system «Facet Wedge» in the treatment of degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine in elderly patients.
The study included 39 elderly patients (older than 60), which carries out the transforaminal interbody fusion Cage «T-pal»: open transpedicaular stabilization was used in 1st group (n=23), ipsilateral open transpedicular stabilization with contralateral transfaset installing titanium Cage «facet Wedge» -in 2nd group (n=16).
We used intraoperative interventions and specific post-operative patient management, clinical data and radiographic outcomes for a comparative analysis of the parameters.
Dynamic assessment was made in a period of 8 to 36 months after surgery (median 24 mo.).
As a result, it found that the use of the system «facet Wedge» allows you to achieve the best clinical outcomes and fewer postoperative complications compared with open transpedicular stabilization in similar radiographic findings of bone block formation.
Low traumatic facet fixation makes it possible to use methods for the treatment of elderly patients with degenerative diseases of the lumbosacral spine.
