[Between depression and fibroniyalgia: the fate of the antidepressant].
The authors present the information about one of the least studied antidepressants- milnacipran.  Recommendations of its clinical use have been long based on incorrect conceptions of its pharmacological properties.
Currently, milnacipran is considered as ancirepinephrine and serotonin (to a lesser degree) reuptake inhibitor and NMDA receptor blocker.
Milnacipran can be successfully used in apatic, asthenic, adynamic and anhedonic depressions as well as in fibromyalgia in patients with marked fatigability and pain.
However the recommendations for the latter are not registered in Russia (maybe due to the differences in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia which is traditionally more often diagnosed as neurasthenia).
