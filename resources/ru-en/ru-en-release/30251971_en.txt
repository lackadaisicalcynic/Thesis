[Depression in patients with personality disorder in youth].
AIM  To define clinical specifics of depression in patients with personality disorders (PD) in youth and work out differential/diagnostic criteria of these states.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and sixty patients (136 men, 24 women, mean age19.5Â±3.2 years) were studied.  Later 42 patients from this group participated in the follow-up study.
RESULTS
The following types of depression were described: 'with overvalued ideas', 'with neurotic disorders', 'with predominant addictions', 'with youth asthenic incapacity' and 'with attenuated psychotic symptoms'.
These types clearly correlate with the type of PD.  CONCLUSION
Personality abnormality plays a role in the pathogenesis of these states.
This finding contributes to the more accurate diagnosis, prognostic and therapeutic solutions.
