[The problem of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in asthmatic patients].  Asthma and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases.
These have common risk factors that include obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and impaired nasal breathing (allergic rhinitis, sinusitis).
At the same time, experimental evidence demonstrates common pathophysiological mechanisms of these diseases, such as involvement in the process of the respiratory tract, a systemic inflammatory response, and implementation of neuromechanical reflexes.  Thus, there is an obvious synergism between these conditions, which affects symptoms, response to therapy, and prognosis.
The available data allow discussion on whether there is a need to identify and treat OSAS in asthmatic patients.
By keeping in mind the high incidence of OSAS in patients with severe asthma, it may be suggested that treatment for OSAS can reduce the number of exacerbations, improve the quality of life, and decline the number of obstinate asthma cases.  It is very important for general practitioners to assess risk factors, such as body weight, nasal stuffiness, and GERD, and to utilize screening tools for more efficient use of healthcare resources.
Considering the known positive effects of CPAP therapy in short-term studies, future investigations should focus on the impact of CPAP therapy on asthma symptoms in the long-term, as well as on the effects of asthma drugs on the course of OSAS.
