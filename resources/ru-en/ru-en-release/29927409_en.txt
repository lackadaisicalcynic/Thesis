[Migraine and Ménière's disease].  The article describes a series of seven cases characterized by a change in the type of attack in the perimenopausal period: migraine attacks before menopause and cochleovestibular paroxysms after the onset of menopause.
Clinical data and results of diagnostic tests are presented and the possible link of both attack variants with cervical pathology is discussed.
The authors explain this dynamics by stem neural integrator dysfunction during hormonal changes.
