[Minimally invasive treatment of rare forms of mechanical intestinal obstruction].  AIM
To develop medical algorithms for reduction of morbidity and mortality in rare forms of mechanical intestinal obstruction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  17 patients with mechanical intestinal obstruction have been operated in Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Care for the period 2010 - 2016.
There were 13 women and 4 men aged 56 (44,5-74,5) years on the average.
Phytobezoar was detected in 7 patients (41.2%), tumor in 7 patients (41.2%) and gallstone ileus in 3 patients (17.6%).
RESULTS
There were no complications in group 1.
In group 2 postoperative complications occurred in 3 patients: gastrocnemius vein thrombosis followed by successful medication (Clavien-Dindo type II), abdominal abscess drained under ultrasonic control (Clavien-Dindo type IIIa) and 1 (8.3%) death (Clavien-Dindo type V).
Postoperative mortality in group 2 was 8.3%.
CONCLUSION
Despite small sample size and no statistically reliable results the advantages of minimally invasive access are obvious.  However, further trials are required to ensure the reliability of the results.
