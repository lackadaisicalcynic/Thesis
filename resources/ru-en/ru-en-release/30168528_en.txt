[The analysis of the results of the medical criminalistics expertises of the blood stains performed at the Bureau of Forensic Medical Expertise of the Moscow Health Department during the period from 2011 till 2015].  The objective of the present study was the analysis of the results of the medical criminalistics expertises of the blood stains with reference to their different characteristics including the occurrence across the years, variability, the forms and parameters of the traumatizing impacts, the properties of the objects with which the injuries were inflicted, etc.
The majority of the data necessary for the analysis were extracted from the archive materials of the Medical and Criminalistic Department of the Bureau of Forensic Medical Expertise of the Moscow Health Department for the period from 2011 till 2015.
A total of 5749 expertises performed during this time included 107 analyses of blood stains, 98 trace-evidence and 9 situational analyses.
The specific features of such expertises include a large number of objects carrying blood stains available for the analysis.  In the majority of the cases, such objects are stained with blood of several types differing in the mechanisms of their formation.
3D-scanning of the scene of the event with the subsequent three-dimensional computer-assisted simulation of the actions of each participant of the accident is considered to be the most promising method for the medical criminalistic expertise of the blood stains.  The application of this approach is believed to make the work of the forensic medical experts significantly easier.
