[Single-centre experience with implantation of the 'E-vita open plus' hybrid stent graft].
Hybrid technologies appear to have been gaining ground in surgery of the thoracic aorta.  The present study was aimed at assessing the immediate clinical outcomes of surgical treatment of diseases of the thoracic aorta by means of the 'E-vita open plus' hybrid stent graft.
The 'E-vita open plus' hybrid stent graft was implanted to 18 patients.
All operations were carried out in the conditions of moderate hypothermia.
The brain was protected by unilateral cerebral perfusion through the brachiocephalic trunk.
The duration of artificial circulation averagely amounted to 265.1 [214; 281] min., with the mean aortic cross-clamping time equalling 150.8 [121; 177] min., and circulatory arrest lasting 55 [47.5; 62.5] min.
In one (5.5%) case resternotomy was performed for haemorrhage.
Five (27.8%) patients required haemodialysis to perform for postoperative renal insufficiency.
A further five (27.8%) patients were found to have transient impairment of cerebral circulation.
One (5.5%) patient was diagnosed as having haemorrhage into the area of the 'old ischaemic focus', one (5.5%) patient developed transient spinal ischaemia spontaneously disappearing within the first 24 hours.
There were no cases of cardiac complications.
A conclusion was drawn that hybrid operations according to the 'frozen elephant trunk' technique yield satisfactory immediate clinical results of treatment in patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection.
