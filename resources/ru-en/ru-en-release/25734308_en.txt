[The use of the lactate-fortified milk whey for the prolongation of the functional life of the voice prostheses].
The objective of the present study was to develop the method for the prolongation of the functional life of the voice prostheses in the patients who underwent laryngectomy with special reference to the decrease of the risk of mycotic infection in the laryngo-oesophageal region.  The original method is proposed with the application of the lactate-fortified milk whey that makes it possible to maintain the high concentration of living lactic acid bacteria in the laryngo-oesophageal segment where the voice prosthesis is located.
The method was tested on 73 patients.
It permitted to significantly prolong the functional life of the voice prostheses (from 12 to 20 months) and prevent mycotic infection.  It is concluded that the proposed method promotes the improvement of the patients' quality of life following laryngectomy for the treatment of cancer.
