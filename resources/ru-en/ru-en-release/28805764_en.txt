[Behavioral phenotyping in rats during the experimental modeling of chronic cerebral circulation disorder].  AIM
To describe motor, adaptive and cognitive disorders in rats with chronic cerebral circulatory deficiency caused by partial stenosis of the common carotid arteries (CCA).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A study was performed on 20 white outbred male rats.
This manipulation led to 40-45% and 50-60% reduction of blood flow in CCA and in the brain, respectively.
Twenty days after operation, animal's condition was assessed in the following tests: open field test, rotarod performance test, marble burying test and novel object recognition.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  After 20 days of experimental CCA stenosis, animals demonstrated several signs of neuropsychiatric deficiency including coordination disorders, a decrease in locomotor activity as well as in explorative and protective behavior.
The model of CCA partial stenosis could be used during further studies of the pathophysiology and pharmacology of chronic cerebral circulatory deficiency.
