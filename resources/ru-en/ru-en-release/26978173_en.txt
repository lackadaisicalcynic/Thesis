[Use of human insulin analogues in young patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: Results of the RESULT observational program on the use of insulin glargine (Lantus) in combination with insulin glulisine (Apidra) as a basal-bolus regimen].  AIM
To implement in 2009-2012 the RESULT observational program on the use of insulin glargine (Lantus) in combination with insulin glulisine (Apidra) as a basal-bolus regimen in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) to evaluate the efficiency and safety of therapy with human insulin analogues.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The program covered 100 patients aged 19 to 25 years from 7 regions of the Russian Federation, who had had DM onset at the age of 9-13 years, were using human recombinant insulins as continuous insulin therapy, and had glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of 7 to 9%.
The main inclusion criterion was switching to insulin therapy with the human insulin analogues Lantus and Apidra.
RESULTS
A total 41 men and 59 women were followed up.  Their mean baseline HbA1c level was 8.3±0.7%.
After 24 months of therapy, HbA1c was significantly decreased to 7.7±0.7%; its change compared with that at Visit 1 was -0.6±0.6% (p<0.001).
There was a significant reduction in fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels at 3 months of a follow-up.
The number of symptomatic and asymptomatic glycemic episodes declined.
No nocturnal or severe hypoglycemic episodes were recorded at 24 months of therapy.
Microvascular complications did not progress during the follow-up.
CONCLUSION
The use of human insulin analogues is effective and safe in treating young diabetic patients, improves their quality of life and confers no risk of asymptomatic or nocturnal hypoglycemic states.
