[Children and adolescents in situations of social distress].
The review article addresses transnational problems of socially stressful events and their contribution to the mental state of children and adolescents.
The authors suggest the concept of distorted socialization in minors, who had experienced adverse events, with the formation of the concept of socially maladaptive distress reactions (SMDR).  This typology has not just the age-related dynamics but also the gender specificity.
Research methodology and systemic approach to SMDR from the perspective of understanding by specialists of various professions are significant for psychologists, neurologists and children's and adolescents' psychiatrists, including the forensic-psychiatric experts.  The combined approach is important for the diagnostic qualification of conditions, development of correctional psychotherapeutic programs and expert approaches with reliance on gender signs, qualitative and quantitative characteristics of personal response in identifying SMDR.
