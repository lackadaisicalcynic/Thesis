[The speech audiometry test with the verbal tasks and motor responses].  The objective of the present study was to estimate the possibility of using the Russian version of the speech audiometry test with the verbal tasks and motor responses (VTMR test) for the examination of the patients of the advanced and senile age suffering from hearing impairment and cognitive disorders.
A total of 20 subjects at the age between 60 and 83 years were enrolled in the study.  All of them presented with grade II-III bilateral symmetric chronic sensorineural hearing loss associated with mild cognitive disorders.  The patients used the hearing aids.  Twelve subjects aged 64-88 years presenting with the normal hearing threshold in both ears and mild cognitive impairment (25-27 points in the MMSE test) were included in the study to serve as controls.
All the listeners underwent tonal threshold audiometry in combination with speech tests in a free acoustic field (perception of polysyllabic words and VTMR) and filled in the relevant questionnaires (MMSE and HHIE).
The results of the study indicate that the VTMR test can be recommended for the evaluation of the effectiveness of hearing aids prescribed to the elderlysubjects and for the study of the auditory function in the patients presenting with cognitive disorders.
