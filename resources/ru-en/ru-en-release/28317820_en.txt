[Formation of bone in critical calvarias defects in rats under the influence of bisphosphonate alendronate Na complex].  The aim of the study was to investigate dynamic of tissue structures in critical defects of calvaria of rats after inoculation of bisphosphonate (BF) alendronate Na complex into bone defects.
Animal model included 24 Wistar rats divided in 3 groups: spontaneous healing under blot clot (1), inoculation of carbonate hydroxide apatite Î²-tricalcium phosphate blocks (2) and BF alendronate Na complex (3) on 15, 30, 60 and 90 experiment day.
New bone formation was observed in group 3 as opposed to groups 1 and 2.
