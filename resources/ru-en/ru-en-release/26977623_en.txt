[Possibilities of preventive therapy in frequent episodic tension-type headache].  OBJECTIVE
To study the efficacy and safety of tenoten in the preventive treatment of frequent episodic tension-type headache (FETHA) compared to patients treated with pain relievers.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A study included 60 patients with FETHA.  Patients of the main group (n=30) received tenoten in addition to standard treatment.
The study comprised 3 visits: beginning of treatment, after one month and after three months.
All patients underwent physical and clinical/neurological examinations.
In each visit, treatment efficacy was assessed according the following parameters: VAS scores (0-10) for assessment of pain and tension in pericranial muscles in 6 standard points, mean frequency and duration of the headache episode, quality of life indices, Beck depression scores, Spilberger trait and state anxiety, autonomic symptom severity, parameters of sleep disorders, frequency of adverse effects, CGI scores (0-7).  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Tenoten as a preventive medication reduced the frequency of headache episodes that allowed to diagnose patients with rare episodic tension-type headache in the end of treatment.  At the same time, there was a significant reduction in headache intensity during the episode and decrease in amount of analgesics used by the patients.
