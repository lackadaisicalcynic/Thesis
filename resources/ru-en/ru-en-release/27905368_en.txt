[Single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy: advantages and disadvantages].
AIM
To analyze the outcomes of single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Early and long-term postoperative period has been analyzed in 240 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCE) including 120 cases of single-port technique and 120 cases of four-port technique.  Both groups were compared in surgical time, pain syndrome severity (visual analog scale), need for analgesics, postoperative complications, hospital-stay, daily activity recovery and return to physical work, patients' satisfaction of surgical results and their aesthetic effect.
It was revealed that single-port LCE is associated with lower severity of postoperative pain, quick recovery of daily activity and return to physical work, high satisfaction of surgical results and their aesthetic effect compared with four-port LCE.  Disadvantages of single-port LCE include longer duration of surgery, high incidence of postoperative umbilical hernia.
However hernia was predominantly observed during the period of surgical technique development.
CONCLUSION  Further studies to standardize, evaluate the safety and benefits of single-port LCE are necessary.
