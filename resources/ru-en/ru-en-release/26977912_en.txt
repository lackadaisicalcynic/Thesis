[A comparative analysis of the efficacy of neuromidin and galantamine in Alzheimer's disease].
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the cognitive changes in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease after the treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors - neuromidin and galantamine.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Fifty-eight patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, aged 60-84 years (mean 73.2±6.7), were enrolled in a 20-week double-blind parallel group study.
All patients were randomized in 2 groups: group 1 (n=28) received neuromidin, group 2 (n=30) - galantamine.
Treatment efficacy was evaluated with the ADAS-cog/11 scale.
RESULTS  Both drugs significantly improved or stabilized cognitive function in the patients.
The most marked changes were obtained in the group of patients treated with neuromidin (р<0.05).
CONCLUSION
The results suggest that the effectiveness of anticholinesterase treatment of Alzheimer's disease could be determined not only by the central but also peripheral cholinergic action.
