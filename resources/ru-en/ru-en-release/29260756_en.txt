[Optimization of reparative dentinogenesis in experimental osteoporosis].  The aim of the study was to assess histochemical changes of the dental pulp in direct pulp capping/experimental osteoporosis animal model.
The study was performed on 20 two-year sheep with simulated acute pulpitis divided in 2 groups: main (15 animals/120 teeth) and control (5 animals/40 teeth).
Direct pulp capping in the main group included tissue-engineered structure composed of a hydrogel PuraMatrix/3DM with ectomesenchymal stem cells immobilized on collagen sponge.  In the control group collagen sponges with hydrocortisone furatsilin, chondroitin sulfate, Ð°naesthesinum were used for the same purpose.
Dentinal bridge formation was much slower in controls than in the main group.
Developed tissue-engineered design optimizes each stage of the healing process by protecting the pulp from infection, reduction of exudation, hemostatic effect and in long term contributes to a significant acceleration of the formation of the dentinal bridge.
