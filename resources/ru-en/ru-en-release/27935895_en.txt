[Structural alterations of a biological prosthesis].  The authors studied dilatation of a biological prosthesis (a specially treated xenograft made of bovine arteries) used as a femoropopliteal bypass in patients presenting with diseases of peripheral arteries.
Structural alterations (ectasia) were examined in a total of 15 patients within the terms varying from 1 year to 7 years after the operation, resulting in working out a methodology of calculating structural changes of the conduit with characteristics of the composite index of dilatation of the conduit.
The presence of aneurysmatically dilated portions whose dimension exceeded the initial size of the xenograft 3-4-fold did not influence the long-term patency of the shunt with preserved blood flow approximated to the major one.
This made it possible to avoid a repeat surgical intervention.
