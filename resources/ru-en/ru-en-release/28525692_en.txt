[Developmental changes of neurotransmitter properties in sympathetic neurons].  Sympathetic ganglia consist of neurochemically and functionally distinct populations of neurons, characterized by a specific projection pattern and a set of neutransmitters including classical mediators (catecholamines and acetylcholine), neuropeptides and small molecules such as NO, H2S, CO.
The majority of the principal ganglionic sympathetic neurons is noradrenergic and expresses tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), i.e., a key enzyme in catecholamine synthesis.
In mammals, two third of catecholaminergic neurons also co-localizes neuropeptide Y.
A small number of ganglionic sympathetic neurons contains enzyme of acetylcholine synthesis and some neuropeptides, such as somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal (poly)peptide (VIP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).
Acetylcholine-containing sympathetic neurons in most cases colocalize VIP and/or CGRP.
Phenotype of autonomic neurons is regulated by both target-independent and target-dependent mechanisms.  The most of transmitters are expressed during embryogenesis.
TH appears during embryonic development and the percentage of TH-positive neurons remains virtually identical during ontogenesis.
After birth, cholinergic neurons exhibit a noradrenergic phenotype.  Expression of different neuropeptides changes in pre- and postnatal development.
Neurotransmitter expression in sympathetic neurons is influenced by growth factor signaling via innervated target tissues.
Multiple growth factors including bone morphogenetic proteins, neurotrophins, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family ligands and neuropoietic cytokines play instructive role at different stages of neurotransmitter development.
