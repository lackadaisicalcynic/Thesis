[Antiinflammatory treatment in patients with chronic back pain].
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are part of the treatment of patients with chronic nonspecific back pain (CBP).  An analysis of the reasons for the absence of NSAIDs administration or cancellation of previously iniciated NSAIDs in patients with CBP was the goal of this study.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We analyzed the peculiarities of treatment of CBP in 250 patients at baseline and after 1 and 2 years.
The features of drug therapy, the reasons for therapy cancellation were evaluated.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  52 (20.8%) of patients with CBP were not treated with NSAIDs, 38 (15.2%) recieved NSAIDs in 4 and > days per week, 44 (17.6%) - 3 and < days a week, 62 (24.8%) took NSAID in 7-14 day 2-5 times per year, 54 (21.6%) - in on-demand mode.
Absence of NSAIDs administration in CBP was associated with older age, the presence of comorbidites, with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and obesity.
The cancelletion of previously initiated NSAID was equally associated with the resolution of pain and with the failure to respond to therapy, with the presence of obesity and with the intake of nonselective NSAIDs.
Continuation of the initiated effective anti-inflammatory therapy was associated with the use of coxibs, complex treatment with the use of neirobion, with the presence of normal body weight, and with the achievement of a decrease in the severity of the pain syndrome even in the absence of its complete resolution.
Increased adherence to treatment with NSAIDs in CBP patients can be achieved by increasing of its effectiveness through the use of NSAIDs (especially coxibs) with B group vitamins (B1, B6, B12), by normalizing of BMI and effectively controlling liver function.
