[The method for the direct evaluation of the state of mucociliary clearance in the children].
The objective of the present study was to develop a readily available, simple to use and acceptable for the application in the childhood method for the evaluation of the state of mucociliary clearance.
We have proposed and presented the detailed description of the simple approach to the direct investigation of the ciliary apparatus of the ciliary epithelium cells that requires neither the expensive sophisticated equipment nor the software programs to be implemented.
Investigations by this method made it possible to elucidate and identify certain details of the functioning of ciliary epithelium.  Other methods for the study of the ciliary apparatus are considered with special reference to their main advantages and disadvantages.
Some debatable problems pertaining to the choice of optimal techniques for the evaluation of the functional state of ciliary epithelium are discussed.
