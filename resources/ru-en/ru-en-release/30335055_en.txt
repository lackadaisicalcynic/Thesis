[Costal cartilage changes in children with pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum].  Pectus excavatum (PE) and pectus carinatum (PC) in children are the most common congenital deformities that cause complications in the thoracic organs; however, the role of chondrocytes and cartilage canals in the pathogenesis of these conditions remains unexplored.
OBJECTIVE  To investigate qualitative and quantitative changes of cartilage lacunae and canals in the costal cartilages in children with PE and PC compared to those with normal chests.
SUBJECT AND METHODS
Costal cartilages were investigated in 10 children with normal chests (a control group), in 12 children with PE, and in 12 children with PC.
Tissue fragments were fixed in 10% neutral formalin and embedded in compacted paraffin.
Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Slides were examined by light microscopy.
Cartilage lacunae, hyper- and hypolacunar zones, and cartilage canals were morphometrically examined, followed by statistical data analysis.
RESULTS
There was a significant decrease in the number of cartilage lacunae and in the frequency of hyperlacunar zones and an increase in that of hypolacunar zones in the PE and PC groups.
There were no significant differences in these parameters between the PE and PC groups; however, there was a tendency to the smallest number of cartilage lacunae and canals in the PC group and that to the preponderance of empty lacunae in the PE group.
Only the PC group showed also negative correlations between the proportions of empty lacunae and the age of children.
CONCLUSION
The pathogenesis of PE and PC in children is related to the impaired trophism of costal cartilages due to the smaller number of cartilage channels containing vessels and lacunae with chondrocytes.
The development of PE and PC is associated with specific costal cartilage morphological changes that suggest that PE and PC are different manifestations of the same disease, namely connective tissue dysplasia.
