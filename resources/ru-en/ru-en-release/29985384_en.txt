[The medicinal mineral waters in the southern part of the Tyumen region].  This article presents data concerning the natural medicinal resources in the southern part of the Tyumen region with special reference to the mineral water resources.
The relevance of the work is determined by the presence of the huge deposits of medicinal sodium chloride and iodine-bromine thermal waters with the composition highly enriched in the trace elements suitable for the internal and external use and by the necessity of the assessment of their therapeutic value.
The characteristics of the mineral waters of special interest are presented with the major emphasis placed on the chemical composition of sodium chloride waters used by the authors in the routine medical practice.
The concrete results of the studiesdesigned to determine content of anions, cations, and trace elements in the water are reported.
Taken together the high levels of iodine, bromine, and silica in mineral waters and their naturally high temperature provide a basis for their extensive and efficient application as a balneotherapeutic factor to be used for the purpose of the spa and health resort-based treatment and prophylaxis.  Also, it opens up the prospects for the extension of the medical indications for the use of mineral waters the basis for further detailed study with a view to increasing medical evidence and taking into account regional particularities of natural iodine deficiency.
Study of the action of trace elements of natural mineral waters taking into consideration the specific regional features of the territory in question, such as natural iodine deficiency.  The study of the action of the microelements on the human organism in the cases of their combined application as well as the evaluation of their use for the prophylactic purposes constitutes an important scientific and practical problem.
