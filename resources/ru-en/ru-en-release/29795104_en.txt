[General anesthesia and intensive care for patients surgically treated for deep neck odontogenic infections].  The study objectives were to determine the significance of deep neck odontogenic infections severity to predict the postoperative morbidity.
Observational study was conducted in 2014-2015.
A continuous sample of 38 patients who were urgently hospitalized in the Novosibirsk Regional Clinical Hospital with deep neck odontogenic infections and operated on the day of hospitalization was analyzed.
SAPS scale rates correlated positively with the duration of the artificial lungs ventilation (ALV).
The positive balance of the introduced and withdrawn liquid in the first day of the postoperative period is associated with the ALV duration, which requires accurate dosing of the infusion volumes.
The described protocol of perioperative care significantly decreases morbidity in patients with deep neck odontogenic infections.
