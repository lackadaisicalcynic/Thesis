[The analysis of the association of the polymorphic variants of the TPMT, COMT, and ABCC3 genes with the development of hearing disorders induced by the cisplatin treatment].
Cisplatin and its derivatives are widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many cancers, including hepatoblastoma, brain tumors, and germ-cell tumors.  This therapy contributed to the dramatic increase in the survival rate.
However, its use is restricted by the high incidence of irreversible ototoxicity associated with cisplatin application (in more than 60% of the children receiving it).
Some studies have reported that genetic variants of TPMT (rs 12201199), COMT (rs4646316), and ABCC3 (rs 1051640) are conferring increased risk of developing cisplatin-induced hearing loss.
However, in other studies the results were not replicated.
In the present study, we replicated the previous studies based on an independent cohort of Russian patients.
SNP genotypes for rs 12201199, rs4646316 and rs 1051640 were determined in DNA samples obtained from 16 patients who developed hearing loss and a group of 34 patients whose hearing was retained.
The association between TPMT (rs 12201199), COMT (rs4646316), and ABCC3 (rs 1051640) variants and the hearing loss was not observed in our cohort.
