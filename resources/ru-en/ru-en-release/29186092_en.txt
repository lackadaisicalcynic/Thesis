[Emergency endoscopic surgery of colon cancer].
AIM
To assess the role of endoscopic technologies in treatment of complicated forms of colorectal cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Our trial included patients after endoscopic intervention (n=18) and open surgery (n=11).  RESULTS
Mean time of surgery in this group was 158.8±10.7 minutes.  In elective surgery group this value was 161.3 minutes (p>0.05).
Mean blood loss was not great (near 122.5±17.9 ml).
Overall and postoperative hospital-stay was 23.1±2.4 and 8.6±0.5 days, respectively.
There were no intraoperative and postoperative complications.  CONCLUSION
Endoscopic interventions may be performed for colon cancer for emergency indications including patients with severe complications.
