[Effects of vascular peptide bioregulator on cerebral microcirculation of old hypertensive rats].  Using a TV device to study brain microcirculation, we found that after a course of vascular peptide bioregulator the density of microvascular network of pia matter of old hypertensive rats (12 months) sensomotor cortex increased about 1,7 times compared to intact old rates SHR.  This perfusion in the tissue of the cerebral cortex and the degree of blood oxygen saturation in the microvasculature of this tissue region raised.
