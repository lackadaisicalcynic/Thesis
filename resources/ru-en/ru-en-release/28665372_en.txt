[The brain after ischemic stroke: a clinical/histological study].
AIM  To analyze the histological features of changes in the brain tissue after ischemic stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Brain tissue samples obtained in autopsy from 9 people died as a result of a left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke from 3 to 7 days after admission were studied.
Tissue samples were taken from 3 areas of the brain: 1) contiguous to the tissue necrotic damage site zone, 2) 5-10 cm distant from the previous one, 3) the contralateral hemisphere zone symmetrical to damage site.
Samples were Nissl and hematoxylin-eosin stained.
Detection of p53 protein, NSE, GFAP was performed by indirect immunoperoxidase immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS
A decrease in the total number of neurons and glial elements, their spatial redistribution, change in cell structure and their functional activity was found.
The changes of the artery wall and impaired regional blood flow were detected.
The more intense NSE reactivity; p53-positive neurons, reduced neuron-astrocytes distance were identified in zones 2 and 3.
CONCLUSION
Ischemic stroke is accompanied by severe histological changes.  These changes with varying degrees of severity occur both in the areas adjacent to necrotic core, and in remote areas, and it is a substrate for neuroplasticity.
