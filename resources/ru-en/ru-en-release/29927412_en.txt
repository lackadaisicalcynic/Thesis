[The influence of confounders on the outcome of ischemic stroke].
AIM  To determine the degree of influence of the confounders on the outcome of ischemic stroke (IS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and eight patients were included in the prospective clinical cohort study.
Based on disease outcomes, two groups of patients were singled out: 1st group - survivors (n=93), 2nd group - patients with fatal outcomes (n=15).  RESULTS
Concomitant diseases were found in 80 (74.1%) patients.
Twenty-eight (25.9%) patients had no concomitant pathology (without taking into account atherosclerosis, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease).
The Pearson Ï‡2 test was 0.005 (p=0.944), which indicated that there was no significant association between the fatal outcome and the presence of confounders.  The relative risk (RR) was 0.963 (95% CI 0.333-2.779), indicating that the likelihood of a favorable or fatal outcome was almost equal.
CONCLUSION  Therefore, the presence or absence of confounders noted in patients of our cohort does not affect the likelihood of a favorable or fatal outcome.
