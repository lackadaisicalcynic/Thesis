[Perspectives of the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using optic coherent tomography].  There is a constant search for new possibilities of the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia.
The problem is important because of the growing prevalence of dementia, 60-80% of which are caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Over the last years, changes in the retina are thought to be a marker neurodegeneration.
Assessment of these changes is performed using a method of optical coherent tomography (OCT) that allows taking cross-sectional imaging of a tissue.
OCT is considered a potential biomarker of the early stage of AD.  Identification of the relationship of the changes in retina and the optic nerve with cognitive impairment open new possibilities for the diagnosis of AD.
