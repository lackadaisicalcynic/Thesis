[On the orientation of palmar whorl patterns].  The objective of the present work was to study the palmar whorl patterns for the inclusion them in the scope of dermatoglyphic signs along with the arc and loop patterns having a well apparent structural organization.
For the first time in the history of domestic dermatoglyphic studies, we described the structure of palmar whorl patterns (based on the palmar prints obtained from 555 subjects) with respect to the surrounding tri-radii.  Moreover, the role of their radiants in the formation of node orientation was considered.
The analysis of the variants of palmar whorl patterns encountered in the study sample provided a basis for the elaboration of the rule for determining their orientation.  Specifically, the orientation of the palmar whorl patterns can be found from the direction of the embracing radiants as in the loop or complex patterns.
