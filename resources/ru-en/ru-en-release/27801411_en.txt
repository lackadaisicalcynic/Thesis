[The influence of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation on the healing of thermal wounds (an experimental study)].
The topicality of the problem stated in the title of the this article is attributable to the lack of up-to-date information on the treatment of thermal skin wounds with the use of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVR).  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the courses of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation under experimental conditions using a model of standardized thermal skin wounds in rabbits starting from the proliferative phase of the healing.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The experiments were carried out on 24 grey rabbits.
The thermal wounds were inflicted using a special device at a temperature of 180 degrees Celsius with a 3 sec exposition.
The BOP-4 apparatus operated in the 180-280 nm wavelength range was used to treat the wounds.
The total length of the treatment course was 10 days with wound irradiation during 8 to 12 minutes every other day (a total of 5 irradiation sessions throughout the study period).  The study methods included morphological ones (microscopy of hematoxylin-eosin and Van Gieson-stained samples, planimetry), hematological (complete blood count), biochemical (general clinical), and microbiological (wound infestation).
RESULTS
The study has demonstrated the acceleration of the wound healing process as appeared from the contraction and epithelialization of the lesions, the reduction of microbial infestation, the improvement of the general condition of the animals, and positive dynamics of the hematological and biochemical parameters.
CONCLUSION
The results of the present study give evidence that shortwave ultraviolet irradiation is a highly efficient method for the treatment of the thermal skin wounds and the data obtained themselves provide an additional confirmation of the evidence-based effectiveness of light therapy.
