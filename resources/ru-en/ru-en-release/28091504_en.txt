[Evaluation of the antitumor potential of cerebrolysin].
AIM  To investigate the effect of cerebrolysin on the growth and metastasis of malignant tumors in mice (a model of lung carcinoma Lewis).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was performed on 60 male mice, hybrids F1 (the age of 2-2.5 months, body weight 19-22g.).
Transplantable epidermoid Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) was used as a standard experimental model to evaluate the properties of the potential antitumor agents.
Experimental animals were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of cerebrolysin in doses of 524 mg/kg (n=20) and 1800 mg/kg (n=20) daily from 2 to 16 days after tumor transplantation.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Compared with the control group (n=20), cerebrolysin induced growth inhibition of LLC during the treatment (7 to 16 days).
An impact of the drug was accompanied by the inhibition of the tumor growth rate by 10-15% (p<0.05).
Cerebrolysin demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of reducing the large number of metastases: a number of large metastases significantly decreased by 30-50% with the increase of cerebrolysin dose (p=0.01).
Cerebrolysin can significantly suppress the growth rate of Lewis lung carcinoma.
