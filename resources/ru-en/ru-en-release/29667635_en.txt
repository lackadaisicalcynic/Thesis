[The application of the 'Biometriclal Dactylography 17.0' program complex for the digital interpretation of the finger dermatoglyphic features].  The objective of the present study was the development of the computer software for the scale-free interpretation of the finger dermatoglyphic features needed for the objective comprehensive evaluation of their principal characteristics in the digital terms.
We have elaborated the program complex making it possible to address the following problems: thr formulation of the database of electronic copies of the finger print and toe print images in the family groups, the display of the finger print and toe print images on the screen, marking the points and lines for automated readout of digital angular and metric information or automated calculation of relative values, the formulation of the database of digital information about the papillary patterns on the fingers and toes in the family triplets (farther + mother + child) and its import into an Excel file.
