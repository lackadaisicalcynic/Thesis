[The foreign experience with the application of the modern radiodiagnostic methods for the estimation of prescription of death coming and time of infliction of injury].  We undertook the analysis of the foreign publications concerning the application of the modern radiodiagnostic methods (including MSCT- and MRI-visualization) with reference to the solution of the traditional problems facing forensic medical expertise, such as the estimation of prescription of death coming and time of infliction of injury in the dead bodies.
Both advantages and disadvantages of postmortem visualization of the corpses of adult subjects are discussed taking into consideration the period of time that elapsed between the death and the onset of the study as well as the character of the injuries.
It was shown that the examination of the corpses using the up-to-date methods of radiodiagnostics prior to autopsy makes it possible for morphologists, jointly with radiologists, to identify, to see in the new light, and to evaluate the number of charges in the dead body, such as the alteration of the blood cell sedimentation rate, the formation of postmortem hypostases in the internal organs, the hardening of the walls of aorta and major blood vessels, right heart dilatation, gradual smoothing of the borderline between grey and white matter of the brain.
Virtual autopsy can be useful , even for the study of such long-term processes in the corpses as putrefaction, saponification, mummification, and peat tanning.  Moreover, this technique may be instrumental in the elucidation of the specific features of topographic-anatomical relationships between individual 'tissues and organs, detection of the concealed lesions, and a variety of pathological changes.
Postmortem visualization allows for the quantitative evaluation of the severity of these transformations and the preliminary estimation of prescription of death coming.
Also, radiodiagnostic methods can be employed to reliably visualize and measure various hemorrhagic events (from the density of such ones as liquid and clotted blood) in the tissues surrounding the fractures, in body cavities, and internal organs as well as to establish the facts of inter-vital aspiration of blood, alimentary masses, liquid and solid foreign bodies penetrating into the upper sections of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as the consequence f an injury.
It is concluded that the postmortem visualization techniques employed to estimate prescription of death coming and time of infliction of injury as well as other complicated problems facing forensic medical expertize need the further scientifically based development.
