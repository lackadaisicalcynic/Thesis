[Oligosecretory monoclonal gammopathy with renal involvement].  The article deals with the so-called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which is being actively explored in the world and has been recently investigated in Russia.
It indicates the principles of identifying the phenotypes of MGUS and criteria for assessing the risk of its progression to cancer.
There is an update on the possible involvement of monoclonal proteins in the pathogenesis of certain non-neoplastic kidney diseases, renal injuries in particular.
The paper gives their classification and enumerates differential diagnostic techniques, including the Freelite method, a highly sensitive one to determine free light chains (FLC), prognostic criteria, and approaches to treating each separate form in relation to the phenotype of a monoclonal protein.
The authors present their own data on detection rates for MGUS at a multidisciplinary hospital and a clinical case of MGUS-associated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, by justifying a treatment regimen containing bortezomib (velcade).
