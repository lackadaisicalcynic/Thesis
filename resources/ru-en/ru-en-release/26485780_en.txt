[Morphological parameters of the heterogeneity of the substantia nigra in elderly men and women].
OBJECTIVE
to define the quantitative characteristics of cell structures in the substantia nigra pars compacta of neurologically healthy elderly people (men and women).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Autopsy brain materials from neurologically healthy men and women who had died from intercurrent diseases at the age of 72 to 87 years were examined for quantitative characteristics of the substantia nigra pars compacta, by applying computed morphometric methods.  RESULTS
In the elderly people (men and women), the compactness of arrangement of neurons, including those containing tyrosine hydroxylase (a marker of dopamine neurons), was much higher and the glial index was lower in the ventral area of the substantia nigra pars compacta than in the dorsal area.  Comparing the structures in the substantia nigra pars compacta showed that the neurons were larger in the dorsal area and the variability of the compactness of their arrangement and the glial index were higher in the women than in the men.
CONCLUSION
In the elderly people, the cell structures in the substantia nigra pars compacta are typified by high morphometric heterogeneity.
