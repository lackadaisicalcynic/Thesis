[On the training of the expert and pedagogical personnel for the forensic medical services of the Republic of Kazakhstan].  We undertook the analysis of the legislative acts currently in force in the Republic of Kazakhstan pertinent to the training of the expert and pedagogical personnel for the forensic medical services with special reference to their advantages and disadvantages from the standpoint of legal regulation of the activities in this sphere.
The problems of staffing support of expert practice are illustrated on the example of activities of the Almaty branch of the Centre of Forensic Medicine of the Kazakh Ministry of Justice.
The approaches to the solution of these problems are proposed.
