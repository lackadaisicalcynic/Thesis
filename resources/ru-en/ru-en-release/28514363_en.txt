[The immunological characteristics and enzymatic activity of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of the children presenting with pharyngeal tonsillar hypertrophy].  The objective of the present work was to study the immunological characteristics and activity of NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases in peripheral blood lymphocytes in the young children presenting with pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy (PTH).
A total of 57 children at the age from 1 to 3 years with PTH were available for the examination.
The control group was comprised of 35 age-matched practically healthy children.
The amount of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+/56-, and CD19+ cells in the peripheral blood was determined with the use of the cytoflowmetric technique.
The activity of NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases in the peripheral blood lymphocytes was quantified by the method of A.A. Savchenko and co-workers
([14].
Serum IgA, IgM, and IgG levels were measured as described by G. Mancini and co-workers [12], and the levels of the circulating immune complexes (CIC) by the method of Haskova and co-workers [13].
The children presenting with pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy were found to undergo changes in the immune-phenotypic spectrum of peripheral bloods lymphocytes, the decrease of serum IgA concentration, and the increase in the serum CIC level.
The activity of riboso-5-phpsphate- and NADH-dependent reactions of the macromolecular synthesis was increased whereas the role of the malate-aspartate shunt in the cellular energy metabolism and activity of glycolysis decreased.  On the contrary, the substrate flow in the tricarbonic acid cycle was rather high while glutathione reductase activity was low.
The present study has shown that the children presenting with pharyngeal tonsil hypertrophy underwent changes in the immune and phenotypic spectrum of peripheral bloods lymphocytes, the decrease of serum IgA concentration, and the increase in the serum CIC level.
