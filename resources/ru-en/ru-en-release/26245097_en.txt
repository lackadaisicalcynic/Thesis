[The compensatory and adaptive e reactions of the respiratory system as the diagnostic criteria for histological studies in forensic medicine].  The objective of the present study was to characterize the structural changes in the respiratory system equivalent to its compensatory and adaptive reactions in response to the action of various factors under the normal and extreme conditions for the assessment of the possibility of their further use for the purpose of diagnostics.
The action of various factors on the tissues obtained from the human respiratory system for forensic medical examination was shown to cause combined histomorphological alterations that refelect a wide spectrum of protective, compensatory, and adaptive reactions.
The range of potential morphological and functional changes in the respiratory system depends on the characteristics of endogenous and exogenous factors influencing the organism of the affected subjects.
It is concluded that the use of the proposed approach to morphological diagnostics may be useful for the development of criteria for the evaluation of various variants of tanatogenesis with their objective confirmation by mathematical models.
