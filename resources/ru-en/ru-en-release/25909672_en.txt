[Tympanometry in premature babies during the first year of life].  The objective of the present work was to study the tympanograms of the premature infants during the first year of their life and to determine the optimal time for performing high-frequency and low-frequency tympanometry in the babies of different gestational age.
It was shown that the middle ear as an apparatus of the sound-transmitting system becomes to function stably by the 6th month of life although the mechanisms for regulation of stabilization develop only in the end of the first year.
For this reason, tympanometry in the children of the gestational age 29 - 32 , 33 - 37 Ð¸ 38 - 40 weeks should be performed using two frequencies of the probing tone (226 Hz and 1 kHz) up to the 6 months of life inclusive and from 28 weeks to 1 year.  Key words: premature baby, tympanometry, acoustic function.
