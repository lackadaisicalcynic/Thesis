[The analysis of the low and medium molecular weight substances for differential diagnostics of deaths from acute small-focal myocardial infarction and other forms of cardiac pathology].  The objective of the present study was to analyze the possibilities for the use of the low and medium molecular weight substances for differential diagnostics of deaths from acute small-focal myocardial infarction and other forms of cardiac pathology.
We determined the amount of the low and medium molecular weight substances in the urine obtained from the subjects who had died as a result of chronic coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, and alcoholic cardiomyopathy.  The levels of the low and medium molecular weight substances in the urine were measured by the method of N.Ya. Malakhov in the modification of T.V. Kopytova [5].
The study has demonstrated the appearance of the products of cardiomyocyte degradation (giving rise to a peak at a wavelength of 278 nm) in the fraction of the low and medium molecular weight substances of the urine from the patients suffering from acute small-focal myocardial infarction and some other forms of cardiac pathology.
