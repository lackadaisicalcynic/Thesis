[Neuroimaging and molecular biomarkers of dementia].  Development of laboratory diagnosis and neuroimaging revealed a number of biomarkers for in vivo diagnosis of the most common forms of dementia (Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia and vascular dementia).
Currently, the highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of molecular biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid are detected for Alzheimer's disease.
At the same time, the changes according to the magnetic resonance imaging are more prognostically significant for future cognitive decline than cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers.  Cerebral microbleeds are an available adjuvant diagnostic marker, which increases the diagnostic value of leukoaraiosis that suggests the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertensive microangiopathy, especially in cases of mixed pathology and severe cognitive deficits.
