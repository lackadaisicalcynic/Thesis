[The forensic medical evaluation of the injuries inflicted inside the passenger compartment of a moving car equipped with the modern personal safety systems].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the characteristic features of the injuries inflicted to the victims of a road traffic accident inside the passenger compartment of a moving car equipped with the modern personal safety systems.
The materials available for the present work included the lesions documented in 210 drivers and 150 occupants of the car passenger compartments.
Both comparative, morphometric and statistical methods were used to analyze the data obtained.  The morphometric analysis included identification of the form of the injury, such as extravasation, wounds, fractures, and lesions of the internal organs (e.g. hemorrhages, ruptures, etc.), their number and localization.
Special attention was given to the specific features of the injuries to the occupants of the cars equipped with the modern personal safety systems.
The study has demonstrated that the form, frequency, and localization of the injuries inflicted to the victims of a road traffic accident inside the passenger car compartment (including the drivers and other occupants) can be used for determining the positions of the victims at the moment of the accident.
