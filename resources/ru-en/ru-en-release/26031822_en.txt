[The results of combined ozone therapy using in complex treatment of soft tissues infections in patients with diabetes mellitus type II].  Levels of interleukins-6, 8, 10, TNF-alpha and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were examined in peripheral blood of 60 patients with diabetes mellitus type II and soft tissues infections.
It was revealed the elevated levels of proinflammatory (IL-6, 8), anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines and basic fibroblast growth factor at the time of admission.
Application of combined ozone therapy including ozonated autohemotherapy and superficial management of wounds with ozone-oxygen mixture resulted in significant decrease of IL-6, 8, 10 production and high level of bFGF on blood serum.  Thus effective local bactericidal impact of ozone in combination with normalization of proinflammatory cytokines levels and preserved high level of bFGF in peripheral blood provide better results of wound healing process in patients with diabetes mellitus type II.
