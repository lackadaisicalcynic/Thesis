[Specific features of neurological complications developing in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome: possibility for correction and prevention].
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and preceding metabolic disturbances has reached epidemic proportions.
Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the development of micro- and macrovascular complications in patients with DM.  The accumulation of free radicals is responsible for the development of systemic and vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulable and ischemic states.
