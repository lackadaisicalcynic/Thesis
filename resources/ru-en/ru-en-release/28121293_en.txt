[Intraocular pressure measurement inside the anterior chamber: a new technical solution and results].
AIM
To develop a new manometric device for intravital measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) in the anterior chamber and to assess tonometric data reliability, including post-radial keratotomy (RK) measurements.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The experiment was conducted in 2 isolated cadaver eyes, while the clinical study enrolled 20 patients (21 eyes) scheduled for cataract phacoemulsification surgery.
Of them, 10 patients (10 eyes) with immature cataract and mild to moderate myopia constituted the control group.
The study group consisted of the other 10 patients (11 eyes) with immature cataract, who had undergone RK more than 15 years earlier.
The following tonometry methods were used: dynamic bi-directional corneal applanation (ORA, Reichert, USA), dynamic contour tonometry (Pascal tonometer, Zeimer, Switzerland), and rebound tonometry (ICare Pro, Tiolat, Finland).
An original device was developed for intravital manometric measurements.
RESULTS
Manometric data obtained during the experiment matched the preset pressure in the anterior eye chamber.
The median manometry results in the control and study groups were similar and equaled 21.5 and 21.0 mmHg, respectively.
Preoperative tonometry readings ranged from 14.9 to 16.5 mmHg in the control group and from 19.7 to 23.3 mmHg - in the study group (with the exception of midperipheral rebound tonometry that showed 15.8 mmHg).  CONCLUSION
The developed device can well be used in experimental research.  Midperipheral rebound tonometry was found to be the most informative method for post-RK IOP assessment.
Manometry results in the study group mismatched tonometry readings in the controls, which might be due to the specifics of equipment calibration and requires further investigation.
