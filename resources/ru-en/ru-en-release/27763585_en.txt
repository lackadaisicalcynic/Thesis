[The expert assessment of kidney damage morphology for the elucidation of the mechanism, intravitality, and duration of the injury].
The objective of the present study was the expert assessment of the morphological signs of renal lesions depending on the type of deformation associated with a blunt trauma.
The authors proposed the algorithm for the description of a kidney damage taking into consideration the specific morphological features associated with a blunt trauma.  The pathomorphological changes in the kidney tissue under the normal hemodynamic conditions and in the case of hemorrhagic shock at different times after the injury taking into account its organ specificity make it possible to reliably predict the duration of the post-traumatic period.
