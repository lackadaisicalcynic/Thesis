[A telescopic vertebral endoprosthesis for subaxial cervical fusion].  PURPOSE
The study purpose was to develop an anterior subaxial cervical fusion technique using a new telescopic vertebral graft (VG) construction and to introduce the technique into clinical practice.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We analyzed existing VG constructions used in anterior interbody fusion at the cervical spine level and developed our own variant of a vertical, cylindrical, telescopic, mesh, vertebral endoprosthesis as well as a technique of its placement to replace bodies of the cervical vertebrae.  The technique was used in 11 patients with spinal trauma.
The orthopedic and neurological status and outcomes of surgical treatment were assessed using ASIA/IMSOP, Odom, and VAS scales.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The first cases of replacement of a resected vertebra by the proposed construction indicate the advisability of using this VG to restore the sagittal profile, stabilize the operated spinal motion segment, and create conditions for the formation of an adequate supporting bone block.
The graft construction can be filled with a significant amount of a filler and makes it possible to add and tighten the filler after placing the graft into the operating position.
The study demonstrated the construct efficacy.
No postoperative complications associated with the use and placement of the telescopic constructions was observed.
