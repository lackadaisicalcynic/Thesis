[Cases of non-standard approach to treatment of super-refractory status epilepticus].  Authors assume that super-refractoriness is probably characterized by the specific pathophysiological mechanisms of status epilepticus development and canot be treated using standard treatment schemes.
By the example of two clinical cases, we have analyzed the efficacy of complex treatment of super-refractory nonconvulsive and myoclonic status using intravenous valproate, central anesthetics (thiopental sodium, propofol), levetiracetam and cortexin.
Preliminary results suggest that cortexin and levetiracetam as add-on to standard treatment may be vitally important drugs for the patients.
