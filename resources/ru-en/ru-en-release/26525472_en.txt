[Persistent infections in the children presenting with chronic ENT diseases: the potential of etiotropic therapy].  The objective of the present study that involved 176 children at the age varying from 2 to 12 years presenting with chronic ENT diseases was etiological diagnostics and etiotropic therapy of these pathologies taking into consideration the duration of the disease of less than one year (n=72), from 1 to 2 years (n=54), and over 2 years (n=50).
The bacteriological method was employed to identify microflora from the upper respiratory tract and the molecular-biological methods for the detection of Epstein-Barr virus DNA, cytomegalovirus, and 6 types of human herpes virus in the blood and saliva.
All the children were treated with the recombinant interferon preparations given for 1-1.5 months.  For 41% of the children this treatment was combined with antibacterial therapy followed by immunocorrective therapy with interferon inducers (in 79.4% of the patients) or bacterial lysates (20.6%).
The study revealed the predominant role of types 4, 5, and 6 type herpes viruses in the development of chronic ENT pathologies in the children with the gradual lowering of activity of these infections over 2 years.
Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes as well as fungi of the genus Candida were the commonest bacterial and fungal pathogenic agents isolated from the naso- and oropharynx of the children suffering from chronic ENT pathology.
The effectiveness of etiotropic therapy was shown to decrease with time, from 78% during 1 year after the onset of the disease to 30% within the next 2 years.
