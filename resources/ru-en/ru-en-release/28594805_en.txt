[Survival of patients with primary and secondary amputations for critical lower limb ischaemia].  The authors analysed therapeutic outcomes in a total of 171 patients presenting with critical lower limb ischaemia and subjected to amputation at various levels.
In so doing, eighty-eight (Group One) patients sustained primary amputation and the remaining eighty-three (Group Two) patients endured secondary amputation after an initially undertaken attempt at revascularization.
It was determined that performing primary amputation statistically significantly shortened the lifespan in the postoperative period as compared with secondary amputation performed.
There was no clear-cut interrelationship between the presence of accompanying pathology and the lifespan in the post-amputation period.
18 months after discharge from hospital the mortality rate in Group One patients amounted to 52% and in Group Two patients to 29% (p<0.05).
