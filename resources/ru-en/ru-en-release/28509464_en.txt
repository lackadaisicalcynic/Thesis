[Features of memory and intellectual activity among the elderly with different reading productivity].  The aim of this work was the study of indicators of memory and intellectual activity among the elderly with different reading productivity.
The results of the study showed that the elderly were distinguished by a greater number of errors when performing tasks on oral-aural, visual memory and visual-spatial activities.
The mistakes made by subjects with low reading productivity may indicate dysfunction of tone and wakefulness, of receiving, processing and storing information, as well as weakening of hemispheric interaction.
