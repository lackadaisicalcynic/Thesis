[Predictors and modifiers of impulse control disorders in Parkinson`s disease].  Impulse control disorders (ICDs), including compulsive gambling, buying, sexual behavior, and eating, are a serious and increasingly recognized psychiatric complication in Parkinson's disease (PD).
ICDs have been most closely related to the use of dopamine agonists (DAs), perhaps more so at higher doses.
Possible predictor's for ICDs include male sex, younger age and younger age at PD onset, use of dopaminergic agents.
Modifiers of ICDs are pharmacological (medication) and non-pharmacological (surgical, behavioral) treatments.
