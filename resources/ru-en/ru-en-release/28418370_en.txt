[Current study aimed to highlight extent of clot resolution in deep veins and its association with anticoagulation pattern in VTE patients].  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Data of 70 patients with acute VTE of lower extremities (iliofemoral level) was analyzed.
There were 42 patients in the study group which were treated with rivaroxaban (15 mg BID for 21 days, 20 mg od from day 22); 28 patients were in control group treated with conventional therapy (LMWH/VKA).
Extent of clot resolution was assessed on ultrasound.
Data was collected at a day of VTE diagnosis and further at 1, 3, 6 month.
RESULTS
The results of the study demonstrated, that patients treated with rivaroxaban had earlier recanalization and extent of clot resolution was higher than in patients treated with conventional therapy.
After one year of treatment 73,8% of patients in the study group had total or good recanalization compared to 37% of patients in the control group.
