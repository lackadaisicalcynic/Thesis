[Efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of rare forms of muscular dystonia].
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of patients with dystonia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors treated 66 patients with segmental and generalized forms of dystonia, writer's cramp and oromandibular dystonia.
The degree of dystonia severity was assessed using the Burke--Fahn--Marsden scale.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
rTMS treatment of the motor cortex region decreased dystonic hyperkinesis severity.  There was a significant decrease in scores on the Burke--Fahn--Marsden scale (p<0.05).
This method was well-tolerated.  No side-effects were observed, with the exception of one patient, who wished to discontinue treatment because of the twitching of facial muscles during rTMS.
The results of the study allow to recommend wider adoption of this method in complex treatment and rehabilitation of patients with rare forms of dystonia.
