[Anxiety, sleep self-assessment, cortisol and saliva antioxidants in students with occasional experience of shift work].  AIM
To study the anxiety level, sleep self-assessment and indicators of morning and evening levels of cortisol and saliva antioxidants in students with experience of occasional shift work.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
University students (n=159) with experience of shift work were examined.  Psychoemotional status was assessed using the Eysenck personality questionnaire (EPQ), Spielberger-Khanin anxiety inventory, The Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (Nemchin's modification).
The express-questionnaire The Quality of Sleep Hygiene, the Sleep Quality scale and the scale of drowsiness were used to assess sleep.
Saliva morning and evening cortisol levels (ELISA) and the total antioxidant activity (amperometric method) were determined.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
There was an increase in the number of respondents with higher anxiety, higher scores of psychoticism and neuroticism.  According to the self-assessment of sleep, a statistically significant decrease in the quality of sleep hygiene was shown.
Biochemical parameters of the saliva differed significantly only in the morning hours: the increase in cortisol and decrease in the antioxidant activity were observed.  The results suggest the possibility of asymptomatic development of emotional disorders and metabolic disorders in people with occasional night shift work.
