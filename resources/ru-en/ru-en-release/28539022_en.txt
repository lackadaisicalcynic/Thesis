[Chronic kidney disease: contribution to comorbidity in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].  The aim was to study the prevalence of risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and frequency of CKD in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 300 patients with a diagnosis of COPD I-IV were examined.
A high prevalence of risk factors CKD was revealed, there are close correlations between the risk factors and the age of patients and severity of obstructive disorders and the spectrum of comorbid pathology.
The diagnosis of CKD 1-3B stage is set for 47,6 % of the patients.
The obtained data determine the necessity of close attention by clinicians to the study of renal function in elderly patients with COPD.
