[Ocular sarcoidosis as a clinical manifestation of multiorgan involvement].  Eye lesion in sarcoidosis is often the first and only sign of a disorder, which suggests a possible systemic disease.
Currently sarcoidosis is considered a multisystemic granulomatous disease that requires multidisciplinary approach.  PURPOSE
To study the prevalence and clinical aspects of sarcoidosis eyes based on the representative sample of patients diagnosed with extraocular nonspecific granulomatous disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 417 patients with multi-organ sarcoidosis.
Females prevailed in the study population (259 patients - 62.11%); average patient age was 43.5±3.5 years.
RESULTS
Patients with systemic signs of sarcoidosis had an eye lesion in 7.7% of cases.
Females (71.87%) at the age of 48.5±2.5 were diagnosed with sarcoidosis more often.
Among the clinical forms of sarcoidosic eye lesion, anterior uveitis prevailed (59.37%), affection of the posterior uveal tract was observed less often (31.25%); the disease had chronically recurrent course in 53.12% of patients.
Among rare disease forms, orbital granuloma was found in two patients, and one patient had sarcoidosis of the skin of the medial angle of the eye.
CONCLUSION
Analysis of the clinical material revealed the occurrence rate of eye lesion in patients with systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis, and gave insight on the polymorphism of clinical signs of organ lesion in multiorgan and isolated granulomatous inflammation.
