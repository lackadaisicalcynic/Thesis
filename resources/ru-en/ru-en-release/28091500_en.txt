[Pathogenetic aspects of the use of cytoflavine in the treatment of сhronic post-traumatic headache].
AIM  To evaluate the results of using cytoflavin in the treatment of chronic post-traumatic headache and analyze possible mechanisms for implementation of therapeutic effects of the drug.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 76 patients (23 men and 53 women) aged 29 - 57 years (mean age - 38.2 ± 8.3).
All patients received standard basic therapy with simple or combination analgesics.
In addition to standard treatment, 36 patients received cytoflavin in the dosage of two tablets twice a day for 30 days.
Results and сonclusion.
At the beginning, at the end and 25 days after the completion of treatment, the intensity and frequency of headache as well as the severity of asthenic and depressive symptoms were analyzed.
As a result of treatment in the cytoflavin group, there was a significant regression of asthenic and depressive symptoms, which was consistent with the previous studies.
Positive changes in the indicators analyzed were correlated with the decrease in the frequency of cephalalgia.
Since cytoflavin has no analgesic properties, the results are indirect evidence for the significance of psychopathological factors in the pathogenesis of chronic post-traumatic headache.
