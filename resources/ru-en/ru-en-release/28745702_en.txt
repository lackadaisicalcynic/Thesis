[Differential approach for chest wall reconstruction for pectus excavatum in adults].  AIM
To perform the prospective non-randomized single-center trial of pectus excavatum correction in adults.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period March 2012 - March 2016 64 patients aged 18-44 years were treated.  Median age was 23 years.
Male/female ratio was 41/23.  All patients were included into standard survey protocol: chest MDCT, MRI of thoracic spine, pulmonary function test, echocardiography.
Quality of life and complications rate after the Nuss procedure (n=50, 78.1%, group 1) and radical thoracoplasty using nikelid-titanium bar (n=14, group 2) were evaluated.
RESULTS
There was earlier recovery in the 1st group: 3 (2; 4) and 6 (5; 7) days after minimally invasive and radical thoracoplasty, respectively.
Postoperative Dindo-Clavien I-IIIa complications developed in 46 (71.8%) patients.  Most of them did not require additional procedures.
CONCLUSION
Nuss procedure is safe method and can be performed with good results in adults.
