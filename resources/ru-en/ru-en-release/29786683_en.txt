[The application of kinesiotaping for the rehabilitation of the post-stroke patients].  This review of the scientific literature was designed to consider the prospects for the application of kinesiotaping for the rehabilitation of the post-stroke patients.
The relevance of the work arises from the absence of a systemic analysis of the large number of investigations that have been carried out during the past two years.
The objective of the present review article was to evaluate the influence of kinesiotaping on the health status of the post-stroke patients and the course of their rehabilitative treatment based on the results of analysis of the scientific reports published during the period from 2015 to 2017.
The analysis has demonstrated that the method under consideration makes it possible to effectively reduce spasticity, increase the paretic limb power, improve the static and dynamic balance, and alleviate the pain syndrome by virtue of the ability to improve the articulation proprioception and to regulate the muscle tone.
Such effects are known to promote the reduction of muscle tone asymmetry in the patients suffering from hemiparesis and articulation instability which in its turn improves the patients' gait and walking ability, hightens their living standards, and allows to tolerate enhanced physical exertion.
Kinesiotaping actually improves the locomotor function in the post-stroke patients Taken together, the advantages of the approach in question give reason to recommend kinesiotaping for the wide application for the combined rehabilitative treatment of the post-stroke patients.
