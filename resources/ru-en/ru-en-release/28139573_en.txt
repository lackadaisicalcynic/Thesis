[Application of resorbable plates for fixation of a laminotomy flap].  The paper describes a new technology - application of resorbable plates and pins for securing a laminotomy flap in children's neurosurgery.
Four patients were operated on at our clinic.
We describe in detail a surgical technique and compare it with a traditional fixation technique using ligatures.
