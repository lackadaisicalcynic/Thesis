[The use of modern topical medications for the stepwise treatment of allergic rhinitis: the effectiveness and prospects for the further extension of their application].  The objective of the present work was to summarize the results of clinical studies designed to evaluate the effectiveness of 'Momate Rhino Advance' in the form of the nasal spray (based on the fixed combination of mometasone furoate and azelastine) that finds an increasingly wide application for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.
The available data give evidence that this medication can be prescribed to the patients presenting with the severe and moderate form of allergic rhinitis.
The treatment should be started with the use of the combined preparation and continued, after the adequate control of the clinical symptoms of allergic rhinitis is achieved, using 'Momate Rhino' during the next 2-4 weeks for the reliable management of the disease.  It is concluded that the proposed strategy makes it possible to avoid the simultaneous application of multiple medications (polypragmasy) and thereby reduce the intake of medicines by the patients suffering from allergic rhinitis.
