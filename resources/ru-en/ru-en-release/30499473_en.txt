[The chemical toxicological determination of isoniazid and metoclopramide in the objects used for animals poisoning and in biological fluids].  The number of mass casualty incidents among the dogs has significantly increased during a few recent years in the cities of this country; they are most frequently attributed to the activities of the so-called dog hunters.
The dog hunters make use of a variety of chemical compounds for poisoning the dogs.
Most of them are the multi-component substances, with their chemical composition being highly variable and continuously modified.  The objective of the present study was to develop the method for the isolation and identification of isoniazid and metoclopramide introduced into the baits that are distributed by the dog hunters for the poisoning of the animals.
The proposed method was tested with the use of biological fluids obtained from the laboratory animals.
The effectiveness of isolation of the compounds of interest from these materials with the use of the liquid-liquid and fractional freezing extraction techniques was evaluated.
In addition, the method for solid phase extraction with the use of the 'Oasis HLB' cartridges was developed.
