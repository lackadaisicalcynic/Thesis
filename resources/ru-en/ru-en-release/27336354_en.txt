[Prolonged prevention of venous thromboembolic complications (VTECS): who is it indicated for and how should it be carried out?].
The publication contains a review of present-day positions on prolonged prevention of venous thromboembolic complications.  This is followed by considering the role of risk factors, probabilistic value of prognostic scales, as well as reflecting the provisions of the recent Russian and international consensus documents concerned.
Careful consideration is given to the major possible parameters a physician could be guided by in real clinical practice while choosing and deciding upon appropriate terms of prevention.
Also shown are possibilities of using novel oral anticoagulants in practical implementation of such regimens.
