[Surgical management of chronic pancreatitis complicated by biliary and duodenal obstruction].  AIM  To compare different surgical approaches to chronic pancreatitis complicated by biliary and duodenal obstruction.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
In the study (n=42) and control (n=36) groups 18 and 4 resections were performed respectively (p=0.004).
Early postoperative complications occurred in 15 cases of the study group and 4 cases of the control group (p=0.024).
7 and 1 re-operations were made in both groups respectively (p=0.99).
There was no postoperative mortality in both groups.
There were 4 cases of return to false-negative results of intraoperative biopsy in the control group.  In these patients resection was possible during primary surgery.
CONCLUSION  Resections are advisable for chronic pancreatitis complicated by obstructive jaundice and duodenal obstruction because it eliminates biliary and duodenal obstruction and can accurately determine the nature of disease.
