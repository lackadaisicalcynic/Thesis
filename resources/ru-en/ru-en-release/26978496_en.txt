[Strategies on the improvement of chronic migraine treatment efficacy].  OBJECTIVE
To determine the efficacy of type A botulinum toxin (lantox) in the treatment of chronic migraine.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 22 patients with chronic migraine at baseline and 4 and 12 weeks after the introduction of 150 U of lantox in head and cervical muscles using "follow the pain method".
The drug was introduced into the following muscles: m. corrugator, m. procerus, m. frontalis, m. temporalis and m. Ð¾ccipitalis.
Clinical/neurological examinations, a study of the emotional sphere (anxiety and depression), daily activities, quality-of-life, patient's completion of questionnaires on the subjective satisfaction with treatment were carried out.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
There was a significant positive effect of treatment on the frequency of headache attacks that was important for reverse transformation of chronic pain to episodic headache.
Barriers in compliance may be overcome by solving psychological problems, in particular, overcoming depression.
The prescription of the drug with no side-effects and fast results allows to support the adherence of the patient to treatment.
