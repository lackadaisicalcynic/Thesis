[Diaphragm relaxation surgery].
AIM  To develop examination algorithm and to determine the indications for various options for surgical treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It is presented analysis of surgical treatment of 25 patients with unilateral diaphragm relaxation for the period from 1963 to 2016.
There were 15 men and 10 women aged from 39 to 65 years.
Diagnosis included predominantly radiological methods.
All patients were operated openly through thoracotomy.
Procedure consisted of creation of new diaphragmatic cupola at the usual level with two flaps of diaphragm and prosthesis between them.
In 12 (48%) patients who were operated before 1990 xenopericardial patch was used.
Further, synthetic materials (Teflon, polypropylene) were preferred.
RESULTS
Postoperative morbidity and mortality was 20% (n=6) and 4% (n=1) respectively.
Long-term results were followed-up within terms from 8 months to 12 years.
Recurrent relaxation was absent.
Most of patients had improved dyspnea, increased vital capacity and FEV1 in long-term period.
Certain and general values of SF-36 life quality questionnaire were high in long-term postoperative period and similar to those in general population.
