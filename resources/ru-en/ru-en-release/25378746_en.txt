Establishing an early warning alert and response network following the Solomon Islands tsunami in 2013.  PROBLEM
On 6 February 2013, an 8.0 magnitude earthquake generated a tsunami that struck the Santa Cruz Islands, Solomon Islands, killing 10 people and displacing over 4700.
APPROACH
A post-disaster assessment of the risk of epidemic disease transmission recommended the implementation of an early warning alert and response network (EWARN) to rapidly detect, assess and respond to potential outbreaks in the aftermath of the tsunami.
LOCAL SETTING
Almost 40% of the Santa Cruz Islands' population were displaced by the disaster, and living in cramped temporary camps with poor or absent sanitation facilities and insufficient access to clean water.
There was no early warning disease surveillance system.
RELEVANT CHANGES
By 25 February, an EWARN was operational in five health facilities that served 90% of the displaced population.
Eight priority diseases or syndromes were reported weekly; unexpected health events were reported immediately.
Between 25 February and 19 May, 1177 target diseases or syndrome cases were reported.
Seven alerts were investigated.
No sustained transmission or epidemics were identified.
Reporting compliance was 85%.
The EWARN was then transitioned to the routine four-syndrome early warning disease surveillance system.
LESSON LEARNT
It was necessary to conduct a detailed assessment to evaluate the risk and potential impact of serious infectious disease outbreaks, to assess whether and how enhanced early warning disease surveillance should be implemented.
Local capacities and available resources should be considered in planning EWARN implementation.
An EWARN can be an opportunity to establish or strengthen early warning disease surveillance capabilities.
