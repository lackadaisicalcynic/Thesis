[Musculoskeletal system as a target organ of a frailty processes].  Pathology of the musculoskeletal system is widespread in the population and is one of the most common diseases of patients in older age groups.
The most significant of them are osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and sarcopenia.
All three components separately, of course, lead to lower quality of life.
In our work we show the mechanisms of interference of these states at each other, and their combined impact on the musculoskeletal system as a target organ processes senile asthenia.  Osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and sarcopenia, and especially their combination lead to hypomobility.
Hypomobility under the influence of external factors is one of the leading syndromes potentiating aggravation processes senile asthenia.
Thus, the mechanism of re-entry is triggered, and a vicious circle leading to fatal medical-social and social consequences.
It is shown that changes in the musculoskeletal system should be considered as a single aging within senile asthenia, and all used and newly created medical and social rehabilitation and prevention programs should be integrated in nature.
