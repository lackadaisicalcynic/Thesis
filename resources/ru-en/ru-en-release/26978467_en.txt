[Multi-stage surgical treatment of woundeds with combined thermomechanic injuries in local armed conflict].  AIM
To improve the results of surgical treatment of woundeds with combined thermomechanic injuries in local armed conflict.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was analyzed treatment of 93 victims with thermomechanic injuries.
In 29 (31.2%) aptients only Early Total Care protocol (ETC) was used up to 2001.  These victims received complete surgical care.
