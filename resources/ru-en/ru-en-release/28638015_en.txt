[Microelemental homeostasis correction of and oxidative stress in patients with acute intestinal obstruction].
AIM
To improve the results of treatment of patients with acute small bowel obstruction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The research is based on the results of a comprehensive survey 202 people with acute small bowel obstruction.  Reamberin was used in 102 patients treatment.
RESULTS  It was established that metalloenzymes take an active part in the formation of endotoxemia in people with acute small bowel obstruction.
Also, in patients as a result of an imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant systems, accumulated a significant amount of lipid peroxidation products, along with it a decrease activity of enzymes of antioxidant system. reamberin application in complex treatment of acute small bowel obstruction provided the reduction in the time correction of oxidative stress by preventing the growth and activity of lipid peroxidation products with simultaneous stimulation of the antioxidant system and contributed to the normalization of microelement homeostasis.
