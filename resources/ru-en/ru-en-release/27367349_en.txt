[The algorithm for rehabilitation of the patients presenting with laryngeal cancer following open functionally sparing operations].  The objective of the present study was to increase the efficiency of the treatment of the patients presenting with laryngeal cancer by the enhancement of the functional reserve of the preserved portion of the larynx and the prevention of the narrowing of its lumen.
Another objective was to develop an algorithm for the rehabilitation of the patients with laryngeal localization of the tumour following open functionally sparing operations that consists of the operative and postoperative stages.
During the period from 2006 to 2014, a total of 71 patients underwent functionally sparing operations.  66 of them were operated for laryngeal cancer, 1 for thyroid cancer spreading over trachea and larynx, 3 for papillomatosis.
Resection of the larynx in the vertical and horizontal planes was performed in 62 and 9 patients respectively.
Vertical plane surgery included the following procedures: fronto-lateral resection of the larynx in 51 patients, extended fronto-lateral resection in 10, and combined resection in 1 patient.
It is concluded that the systemic approach to the treatment of the patients with laryngeal cancer and the proposed algorithm for their rehabilitation made it possible to restore the laryngeal function in 68 of the 71 patients (95.8%).
