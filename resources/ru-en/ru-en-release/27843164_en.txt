Implementation research: a mentoring programme to improve laboratory quality in Cambodia.
OBJECTIVE  To implement a mentored laboratory quality stepwise implementation (LQSI) programme to strengthen the quality and capacity of Cambodian hospital laboratories.
METHODS
We recruited four laboratory technicians to be mentors and trained them in mentoring skills, laboratory quality management practices and international standard organization (ISO) 15189 requirements for medical laboratories.
Separately, we trained staff from 12 referral hospital laboratories in laboratory quality management systems followed by tri-weekly in-person mentoring on quality management systems implementation using the LQSI tool, which is aligned with the ISO 15189 standard.
The tool was adapted from a web-based resource into a software-based spreadsheet checklist, which includes a detailed action plan and can be used to qualitatively monitor each laboratory's progress.
The tool - translated into Khmer - included a set of quality improvement activities grouped into four phases for implementation with increasing complexity.  Project staff reviewed the laboratories' progress and challenges in weekly conference calls and bi-monthly meetings with focal points of the health ministry, participating laboratories and local partners.
We present the achievements in implementation from September 2014 to March 2016.
FINDINGS
As of March 2016, the 12 laboratories have completed 74-90% of the 104 activities in phase 1, 53-78% of the 178 activities in phase 2, and 18-26% of the 129 activities in phase 3.
CONCLUSION
Regular on-site mentoring of laboratories using a detailed action plan in the local language allows staff to learn concepts of quality management system and learn on the job without disruption to laboratory service provision.
