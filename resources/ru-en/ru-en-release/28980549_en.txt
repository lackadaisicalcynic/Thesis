[The specific features of corpse putrification under the influence of necrobiome enzymatic systems].  The objective of the present study was to characterize the specific features of corpse putrification under the influence of necrobiome enzymatic systems depending on the duration of the post-mortem period.
We present the results of investigations into the enzymatic activity of the dominant species of microorganisms making up the post-mortem microbiome.
The domestic pork carcasses weighing 50-70 kg were used as an experimental putrification model.
The study revealed the characteristic features of protein decomposition under the influence of proteolytic enzymes of pseudomonads, bacilli, and clostridia, such as alteration in the amount of necrobionts producing proteases in the entire carcass and its fragments during biodegradation in the air over 30 and 136 days of the post-mortem period.
A series of experiments designed to evaluate the effectiveness of protein hydrolysis by necrobionts have demonstrated the dependence of the rate of biodegradation on the environmental temperature, duration of the putrification pocess, and the species composition of the necrobiome.
