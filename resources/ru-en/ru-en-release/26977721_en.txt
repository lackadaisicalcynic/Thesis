[Functional loading test with caffeine as a detection method for hydrodynamic disturbances in patients with cataract and pseudoexfoliation syndrome].  UNLABELLED
Different functional loading tests, with caffeine for example, can help reveal certain disturbances in ocular hydrodynamics and it would be interesting to investigate their diagnostic potential in eyes with pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX), which is a known trigger of glaucoma.
Aim - to determine the value of caffeine loading test in the diagnosis of hydrodynamic disturbances in eyes with cataract and pseudoexfoliation syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 98 patients (98 eyes) with cataract and PEX were examined.
Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were taken using the Maklakov applanation tonometer every 15 min during the first hour after a 0.2 ml subcutaneous injection of 10% caffeine/sodium benzoate solution.
RESULTS
Three types of intraocular pressure response to caffeine administration have been described in patients with cataract and PEX.  The severity of hydrodynamic disturbances thus revealed has been also shown to correlate with PEX stage, IOP level, and the presence or absence of cardiovascular pathology, which allows to regard the latter sings as markers of hydrodynamic problems in the eye.
