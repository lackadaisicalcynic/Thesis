[The system stress-limiting action of mexidol in chronic cerebral ischemia].
OBJECTIVE  To clarify the mechanisms of the action of anti-stress antioxidant agent (mexidol) in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty-seven patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (TE stage II),48 women and 19 men, mean age 48.2 years, were examined.
To assess the stateof multilevel stress system, the level of anxiety and depression, degree of autonomic imbalance, adaptive reactions of the blood and functional properties of erythrocyte membranes, level of average weight molecules in the blood plasma were studied.
Therapeutic complexes consisted of standard therapy (vinpocetine and piracetam) and mexidol
(10 ml intravenous drip 200 ml of physiological solution once a day every day for 10 days with subsequent transition to the oral ingestion of the drug (1 tablet (125 mg) 3 times a day for three months).  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
In group 1 treated with additional antioxidant mexidol, the more pronounced and prolonged positive effect on the clinical symptoms of TE was observed.
There were the persistent decrease in the level of anxiety and reduction of autonomic imbalancein the main group.
The dynamics of adaptive reactions of blood indicated the activation of the adrenal cortex.  There was a decrease in the content of average weight molecules and recovery of the sorption capacity of red blood cells.
The results indicate the multi-component multi-level stress-limiting effect of mexidol in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia stage II.
