[Chondroprotectors: A range of application in general somatic practice].
Chondroprotectors (CP) are biological agents that contribute to the regeneration of the cartilage surfaces and articular capsule, participating in the metabolic processes of the articular cartilage.
Progressive loss of hyaline cartilage and lower levels of chondroitin sulfate were observed in osteoarthritis (OA) at different sites, including dorsopathy.
OA therapy is aimed at slowing disease progression, relieving pain symptoms, and reducing functional disorders.
For this purpose, oral or injectable CPs (Chondroguard, Sustaguard) are prescribed.
The optimal dosing regimen of parenteral CPs is the following: three intramuscular Chondrogard 1 ml (100 mg) jections during the first week; 25-30 intramuscular chondroguard 2 ml (200 mg) injections every other day during the second week, a repeat cycle after 6 months; Sustaguard 400 mg thrice weekly for 4 weeks.
