[The role of changes in the structure of water and water-based systems in the mechanism of combined action of the magnetic field and natural therapeutic factors].  The application of the dielectrometric technology in the combination with the resonance method and thermometry has been shown to provide an insight into a variety of factors including the influence of the magnetic field of the permanent magnets on the structure of water and water-containing systems.
It was found that the magnetization of both distilled water and «Karachinskaya» mineral water increase their structuredness.  Magnetization changes the biological properties of therapeutic peloids by virtue of a change in the structure of water and, accordingly, the structuring of the water fraction of therapeutic muds.
The analysis of the results of experimental and theoretical studies gives evidence that variations in the structure of water and water-based systems play an important role in enhancing the effectiveness of the combined treatment with the use of the magnetic field and the natural therapeutic factors.
The positive and adaptogenic effects of such treatment appears to be due to such changes in the structure of water and water-containing systems which facilitate communication between the processes in the resonant mode but maintain stability of the cellular structures by limiting the mobility of water dipoles under the influence of non-resonant frequencies.
