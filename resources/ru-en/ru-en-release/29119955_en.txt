[The effectiveness of combined laser therapy for the treatment of the patients presenting with bronchial asthma and concomitant allergic rhinitis].  A total of 137 patients suffering from bronchial asthma (BA) and concomitant allergic rhinitis (AR) were available for the examination at the stage of the rehabilitative treatment under conditions of the southern coast of the Crimea.
All the patients were divided into three groups.  The patients of group 1 underwent the standard complex of spa and health resort-based climatic therapy procedures (SCT), for those comprising group 2 SCT was supplemented by non-invasive magnetic laser therapy (NMLT) while patients included in group 3 received SCT and the combination of NMLT with endonasal laser radiation (ENLR).
The study has demonstrated that the combined application of physiotherapeutic procedures (NMLT and ENLR) enhances the effectiveness of SCT in comparison with either NMLT or SCT alone in terms of improvement of clinical manifestations of the disease, external respiratory function, laboratory characteristics, and immunological status of the patients suffering from bronchial asthma.
