UNLABELLED  This paper reports the results of the clinical observations and special investigations carried out with the involvement of the children presenting with acute respiratory diseases treated with the use of a Myramistin solution for inhalation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included a total of 60 children with the above condition at the age varying between 2 and 17 years.  Forty patients inhaled the Myramistin solution through a face mask connected to the nebulizer.
The remaining 20 children that comprised the control group inhaled Myramistin in the form of a spray.  RESULTS
The study has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method that produced beneficial effect on the clinical symptoms of the respiratory diseases and characteristics of peripheral blood.  Moreover, it accelerated the recovery of the patients due to the anti-inflammatory and trophic action of the inhaled solution and promoted normalization of mucociliary clearance.
The therapeutic effectiveness of the Myramistin spray was significantly lower than that of the solution.
CONCLUSION
The results of the study provided a basis for the development of the optimal technologies for the application of the Myramistin inhalation solution to the treatment of the children presenting with acute respiratory diseases of the upper and lower parts of the respiratory tract.
