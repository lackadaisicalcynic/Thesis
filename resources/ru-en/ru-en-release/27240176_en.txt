[The efficacy of combination therapy with mexidol and cerebrolysin in chronic cerebral ischemia].
OBJECTIVE  To study the impact of combination therapy with mexidol and cerebrolysin on the clinical status of patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI), II stage, in ambulatory conditions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 36 patients with CCI, II stage.
In addition to basic therapy, patients received two courses of the mexidol/cerebrolysin combination during 6 weeks with 3 month-interval between the courses.
The dynamics of subjective complaints of the patients and objective clinical signs was assessed after each course.
The content of 13 chemical elements in the hair was determined by atomic-emission method after the treatment.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
