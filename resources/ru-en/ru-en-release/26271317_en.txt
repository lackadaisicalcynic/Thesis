[Perforating veins insufficiency in patients with varicose disease].
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was analyzed the results of complex survey and treatment of 181 patients with varicose disease CEAP degrees C3-C6.
Ultrasonic scanning was applied to define localization, severity and extension of blood reflux in venous system.
RESULTS
Superficial reflux was revealed in all patients, perforating--in 59.7%, deep--in 22.8% of cases.
We concluded that high-intensive total-subtotal blood reflux in superficial veins was main hemodynamic factor resulted perforating insufficiency in 42% of patients, high-intensive deep reflux--in 17.7% of cases additionally.
In patients with subcompensated course of disease superficial reflux removal and large perforating veins (diameter 4.5±0.5 mm) ligation are advisable.
Small perforating veins insufficiency (diameter 3.5±0.5 mm) is eliminated independently after superficial reflux removal.  Two-staged treatment should be used in patients with decompensated course of disease and trophic disorders ofshin.
Perforating veins sclerotherapy under ultrasonic control is advisable secondarily after superficial reflux removal.
