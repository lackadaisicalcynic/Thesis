[About the possibility to detect the fact of corpse transportation from the sea coastline with the subsequent burial].
The objective of the present work was to detect and describe the new features characterizing the long-term stay of a corpse in seawater followed by its burial on earth.  The bones of the skeletonized corpse were found to be covered with mussels and petrified sea worms that can serve as the indicators of staying the corps in seawater and its subsequent transportation from the sea coastline to the inland.
These findings can be used to clarify the circumstances of death of the people found in the illegal burial places at the seacoast of maritime areas.
