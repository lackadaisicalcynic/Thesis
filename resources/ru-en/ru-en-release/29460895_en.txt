[On the histo- and morphogenesis of sclerosing pneumocytoma and its diagnostic criteria].  The paper presents the data available in the literature on the pathogenesis, clinical and morphological, histological and immunohistochemical features of pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma (SP).
The paper gives the detailed histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of 6 SP cases.
The need for the differential diagnosis of SP is determined by the features and complexity of their histo- and morphogenesis within a single tumor and a complex diagnostic study.
