High anxiety is a genetically determined personal trait.  It is produced by limbic system and other cerebral structures involved in maintenance of wakefulness and development of sleep.
Analysis of experiments on the animals and clinic observations showed that animals and individuals with high personal anxiety have a high risk of anxiety disorders.  Inhibition of GABA-benzodiazepine system which is typical for high anxiety dramatically influences sleep duration and sleep quality.
Phenazepamum due to its anxiolytic properties deactivates the excitation focus in the brain, jugulates anxiety and normalize sleep.
