[The application of the method of radiofrequency myringotomy under the experimental conditions and in the clinical practice].
Exudative otitis media is a widespread pathological condition in the human population.  In the recent years, the treatment with the electric current having the frequency up to 3.8 MHz has found the increasingly frequent application, in addition to shunting and laser myringotomy, for the perforation of the tympanic membrane to facilitate removal of exudate.
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of the electric current with the frequency up to 4 MHz for myringotomy in the patients presenting with exudative otitis media under the experimental conditions and in the clinical practice.
The experimental studies were carried out with the use of the isolated temporal bones (ex vivo) and laboratory animals (in vivo).  The clinical studies included the surgical treatment of 41 patients presenting with exudative otitis media using the electric current with the frequency of 4 MHz and laser irradiation with the subsequent evaluation of the inflammatory manifestations in the tympanic membrane tissues during the early post-operative period.
It was shown that the method of myringotomy with the application of the electric current having the frequency of 4 MHz is safe and causes no complications.  Moreover, it is accompanied by the development of the minimally active inflammatory processes in the tympanic membrane tissues during the early post-operative period.
