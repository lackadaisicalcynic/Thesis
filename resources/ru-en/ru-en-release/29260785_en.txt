[Allergic rhinitis among the children of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya)].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate dynamics of primary allergic rhinitis (AR) morbidity in the children population of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutiya) from the statistical materials of the Yakutian Republican Information and Analytical Centre available for the period from 2008 to 2014 in the combination with the results of allergological testing based at the National Centre of Medicine, Yakutsk, that involved 100 schoolchildren presenting with allergic rhinitis who resided in the northern regions of the Republic.
The results of the study give evidence of the increasing primary allergic rhinitis morbidity rate among the population of the children and adolescents during the recent years.  It is concluded that the regional programs for the prevention and early diagnostics of primary allergic rhinitis need to be elaborated and introduced in the practical work of healthcare facilities over the territory of the Republic.
