[Electrophysiological parameters of the retina in idiopathic macular hole].  AIM
To investigate the nature and range of electrophysiological disturbances in idiopathic macular hole (IMH) and establish their relationship with structural parameters of the retina.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included 249 patients (280 eyes) with IMH.
All of them underwent ganzfeld and multifocal electroretinography (ERG), optical coherence tomography, and evaluation of retinal electrical sensitivity and analyzer lability.  The results were then compared to those of non-IMH patients (196 paired eyes) and controls (25 people, 49 eyes).
RESULTS
Multifocal ERG findings prove that IMH is always associated with significant changes in bioelectrical potential of the central retina.
In 62% of cases its decreased density and extended latency were registered in not only the fovea, but also the para- and perifovea.  In 8% of cases the changes involved everything within a 30-degree area of the central retina.
In 30% of cases the maximum bioelectric potential was found to have shifted from the centre to para- and perifovea, its amplitude and density being supernormal for these regions (shift phenomenon).  A weak correlation between electrophysiological parameters and retinal thickness around the hole has been also established.
Of all methods used to assess retinal function in IMH, multifocal ERG is the most informative.  In 100% of cases foveal biopotential is sharply reduced in density and disfigured.
In 70% of cases these changes spread outside the fovea.
