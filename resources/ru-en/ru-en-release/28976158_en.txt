[Arterial stiffness in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease, in combination with coronary artery disease and hypertension].  The effect of renal dysfunction in combination with arterial hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD) on the arterial stiffness in elderly patients was studied.
The study included 121 patients (56 men and 65 women) aged 75 to 90 years with chronic kidney disease (CKD): 93 patients with stage III and IV CKD and 28 patients with stage I and II CKD with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of more than 60 ml/min per 1,73 m2 (control group).
To study the method of arterial stiffness ankle-brachial sphygmography, the authors defined parameters of pulse wave velocity (PWV), ankle-brachial index and augmentation index.
In elderly patients with CHD, hypertension and I-II stage CKD PWV was 15,9±2,29 m/s, in combination with stage III CKD PWV was 18,8±2,15 m/s, in combination stage IV CKD PWV was 21,25±2,29 m/s.
PWV was significantly increased with a decrease in GFR per 15 ml/min per 1,73 m².
The researchers found that the decline in renal function in stages III and IV CKD lead to a significant increase in PWV in elderly patients, which allows using this indication to assess the state of the cardiovascular system.
