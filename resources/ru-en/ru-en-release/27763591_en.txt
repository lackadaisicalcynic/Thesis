[The development and validation of the methods for the quantitative determination of sibutramine derivatives in dietary supplements].  The objective of the present study was the development and validation of sibutramine demethylated derivatives, desmethyl sibutramine and didesmethyl sibutramine.
Gas-liquid chromatography with the flame ionization detector was used for the quantitative determination of the above substances in dietary supplements.
The conditions for the chromatographic determination of the analytes in the presence of the reference standard, methyl stearate, were proposed allowing to achieve the efficient separation.  The method has the necessary sensitivity, specificity, linearity, accuracy, and precision (on the intra-day and inter-day basis) which suggests its good validation characteristics.
The proposed method can be employed in the analytical laboratories for the quantitative determination of sibutramine derivatives in biologically active dietary supplements.
