[Repeated tracheal resection for non-neoplastic restenosis].
Treatment of patients with recurrent cicatrical tracheal stenosis after previous circular tracheal resection is one of the most difficult problems in thoracic surgery at present time.
In most cases repeated radical surgery as new resection is declined in favour of palliative treatment.
It is often associated with lingering or perpetual preserving of T-shape or tracheostomy tube and respiratory tract stenting.
Development of thoracic surgery last years permits to perform repeated tracheal resections with restoration of respiratory tract integrity by using of new tracheal anastomosis.  For the last 4 years 6 such operations were performed with satisfactory immediate and remote results.
Diagnostic algorithm before repeated surgery is similar to those before primary intervention.  Special attention should be attended to state of remained parts of respiratory tract, degree and length of stenosis and tracheomalacia which may be result of divergence of edges of the primary anastomosis.
Preserving of not less than 1/4 primary length of intact trachea with its satisfactory mobility is main condition for this surgery because it will permit to perform new anastomosis without high tension.
Risk of postoperative complications after repeated operations is not higher than those after primary resection.  But at present time these operations are in competence of small number of specialists and medical institutions with serious experience in thoracic surgery.
