[Modern approaches to neuroprotective treatment of ischemic stroke].
The authors present the results of domestic clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of mexidol in patients with cerebrovascular disorders including ischemic stroke (IS).  The use of mexidol is associated with complete and rapid regression of the focal neurological deficit.
Mexidol is well tolerated with no significant side-effects.  The drug is recommended for enteral and parenteral administration in patients with IS.
