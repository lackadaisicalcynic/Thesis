[Cognitive dysfunction after coronary artery bypass grafting].
Despite the advances in surgical and anesthetic techniques for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the incidence of neurological complications, including postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), remains high.
CABG is performed more often in elderly patients with severe comorbidities.
However, comprehensive prevention measures and POCD rehabilitation have not yet been developed.  Physical training is an effective and safe method for correcting endothelial dysfunction, severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome, lipid peroxidation, i.e. mechanisms contributing to the development and severity of POCD.
