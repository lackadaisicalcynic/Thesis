AIM  To study the sociodemographic data of people living with HIV who visit AIDS centers.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A multicenter open-label study was conducted, which included the retrospective model "A patient's portrait".

RESULTS
There were women accounting for 49% of the study participants, including one transgender.
Their mean age was 35.6 years; the median age was 34 (18-79) years.
77.4% of the women were infected sexually; 57.4% of the men were infected parenterally; the men who had sex with men accounted for 2.5% of the whole group (4.7% among the men).
Only 9.8% of the respondents reported that they had used intravenous drugs in the past 6 months.

38.3% of the women and 48.8% of the men had a permanent HIV-negative sexual partner.
46% of the study participants had dependent minor children.
30% of the women had given birth to at least one child after the diagnosis of HIV infection.
CONCLUSION
People living with HIV in Russia and visiting AIDS centers do not differ in main social and demographic indicators from the Russian Federation citizens of the same age who do not have HIV.
They represent an economically and socially active population and participate in demographic processes so one of the public health priorities is to maintain and improve their quality of life.
