[The analysis of the effectiveness of the combined treatment of the patients presenting with laryngeal papillomatosis].  The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effectiveness of the application of the inducer of endogenous interferon synthesis in the course of the combined treatment of the adult patients presenting with laryngeal papillomatosis.
A total of 50 patients with this pathology were admitted and examined at the ENT Clinics of I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University and M.F. Vladimirsky Moscow Regional Research Clinical Institute during 24 months.
The patients comprising group 1 (n=25) were treated with the use of cold plasma surgery and the inducer of endogenous interferon synthesis while those included in group 2 (n=25) received only surgical treatment.
It was shown that the combined treatment including the surgical step (cold plasma surgery) followed by the treatment with the inducer of endogenous interferon synthesis to prevent relapses makes it possible to reduce the number of secondary surgical interventions, increase the duration of the intervals between relapses, and decrease the content of types 6 and 11 human papilloma virus in the saliva.
