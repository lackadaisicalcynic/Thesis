The survey was conducted in 19 regions of the Russian Federation and involved 437 patients with confirmed diagnosis of PPMS and 80 neurologists specialized in multiple sclerosis.
The research was carried out by the All-Russian Public Organization of Disabled People with Multiple Sclerosis with the participation of the Russian Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis.
