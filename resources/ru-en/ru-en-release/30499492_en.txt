[Prevention of venous thrombosis of the lower extremities and pulmonary embolism in neurological patients in the intensive care unit using intermittent pneumatic compression].
AIM
To assess the efficacy of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in neurological patients.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 101 patients with acute disorders of cerebral circulation: 52 patients underwent IPC for prevention of DVT of the lower extremities, 49 patients received only basic treatment.  Clinical examination, venous duplex scan of the lower extremities and telethermography were performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
IPC significantly reduces the risk of DVT of the lower extremities and PE mortality in the first 20 days in patients with stroke and motor deficit.  Ultrasound and thermography can effectively assess the dynamics of treatment.
