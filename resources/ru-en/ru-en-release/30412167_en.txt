[The current trends and the tactical-technical approaches to the management of the neoplastic processes in the base of the skull].
The neoplastic processes localized in the base of the skull and the surrounding region have until recently been considered as the inoperable condition.
Juvenile angiofibroma of the base of the skull or angiofibroma of the base of the skull (ABS) is most frequently encountered in the otorhinolaryngological practice.
In terms of the histological picture, ABS is a benign tumour having a very complicated structure.  The multi-disciplinary approach and the application of up-to-date medical technologies made it possible to obtain an insight into the deepest-lying areas of the base of the skull.
A total of 69 patients presenting with juvenile angiofibroma of the base of the skull were available for the examination in the present study.  In all this cases, the presence of the tumour was confirmed by the histological studies.
Apart from the routine medical examination, all the patients underwent X-ray investigations including computed tomography with 3D-reconstruction, angiography subtracted VRT-reconstruction, and magnetic resonance tomography with contrast enhancement.
Moreover, the trans-maxillary-buccal approach was applied with the use of the endovideoscopic equipment.
All the patients were discharged from the clinic in the satisfactory condition.  Recurrent tumours were documented only in three patients, the lethal cases were altogether absent.
The length of the period of follow-up observations amounted to five and more years.
It is concluded that the application of the modern medical technologies in the combination with the 'teamwork' interdisciplinary approach greatly contributes to the successful surgical treatment of the pathological processes localized at the base of the skull and the surrounding region.
