[The typology of oneiroid-catatonic states in schizophrenia].  OBJECTIVE
To determine the types of oneiroid-catatonic states characteristic of corresponding schizophrenia attacks and their treatment-related changes.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 68 outpatients, 25 men and 43 women, aged from 18 to 54 years, using psychopathological and follow-up methods.
Results and conclusion.
Two groups of oneiroid states were described.
Oneiroid-catatonic states with the predominance of visual (optical) component derangement of consciousness were characteristic of the first group and oneiroid states with the prevalence of sensory component of derangement of consciousness were described in the second group.
The second group was divided into two subgroups by the severity of the visual component (minimal and mixed).
The types of oneiroid-catatonic states determined the dynamics of the attack in whole and were related to treatment (drug-induced pathomorphosis).  These results are significant for differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the disease.
