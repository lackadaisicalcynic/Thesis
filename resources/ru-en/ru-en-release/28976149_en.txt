[Intronic polymorphisms of Ð°ntionkogene TP53 in patients with indolent variants of Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas].  The frequency of distribution of alleles and genotypes of single nucleotide substitution G13494A in intron 6 and duplications dup16bp in intron 3 of the gene TP53 in 56 patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and variants in the controls was studied.
The increase of the frequency of G-allele and G/G genotype of intron 6 of the gene TP53 in lymphoma patients compared with controls (91 and 84 % vs. 79 (p<0,01) and 63 % (p<0,01), respectively) was determined.
It was found that individuals carrying the rare A-allele (i.e., having A/G or A/A genotype), had the risk of disease 3,23 times (OR=3,23; [95 % CI 1,50; 6,92], p<0,05) higher than the general population.
No significant differences in the distribution of alleles and genotypes of dup16bp intron 3 of the TP53 gene between cases and controls were identified.
The results indicate that the oligonucleotide G13494A substitution in intron 6 proapoptotic gene TP53 in older individuals may have a modulating effect on the risk of indolent lymphoma.
