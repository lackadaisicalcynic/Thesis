[A study of the efficacy and safety of L-carnitine in patients with ischemic stroke in the early rehabilitation period].
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of L-carnitine injections in patients with ischemic stroke (IS) in the rehabilitation period.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty patients in the early rehabilitation period of IS were stratified into two groups.  Patients of group 1 received elcar, the 100 mg/ml solution for intravenous and intramuscular injection, in dose of 500 mg intramuscular 2 times a day during 7 days, with the second course after 10 days, in the complex treatment of the 2nd stage of poststroke rehabilitation.
Patients of group 2 received conventional therapy.
Treatment efficacy was assessed at end points: 1st visit (the 1 st day of treatment), 2nd visit (the 7-10th day), 3rd visit (28-30th day).The following scales were used: NIHSS, the Barthel index, MFI-20, HADS, the Visual Analogue Scale.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
L-carnitine significantly improved the quality of life of the patients.
The frequency of complaints of cerebral and somatic character decreased significantly which was combined with a reduction in the severity of neurological deficit on the NIHSS.
Moreover, the decreased levels of general asthenia and psychoemotional defect were observed that resulted in the reduction of the percentage of patients who needed help according to the Barthel index.
