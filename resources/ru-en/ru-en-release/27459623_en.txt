[Transformation of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome to atypical chronic myeloid leukemia in a female patient with acute myeloid leukemia].
Secondary myeloid neoplasia may be a complication of intensive cytostatic therapy.  The most common types of secondary neoplasias are acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.
The development of secondary atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) is an extremely rare phenomenon.
The paper describes transformation of secondary myelodysplastic syndrome to aCML 6 months after its diagnosis.
The development of aCML was accompanied by additional chromosomal aberration as monosomy of chromosome 17.
No mutations in the JAK2, MPL, and CalR genes were detected.
It is concluded that the clinical course of secondary myeloid neoplasias is variable.
