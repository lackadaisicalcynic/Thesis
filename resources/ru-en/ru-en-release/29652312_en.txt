[A study on the association of genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines and depression].
AIM  To study the association between proinflammatory cytokine genes and depression.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
IL-1B С-511T and TNF-a G-308A gene polymorphisms were studied in patients diagnosed with depression and age and sex-matched healthy controls.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The IL-1B С-511T and TNF-a G-308A polymorphisms were associated with depression; CC genotype (р=0,001, OR=1.9 CI 1,3-2,7) and GG genotype (р=0,001, OR=3,0 CI 1,8-4,9) were the risk factors.
The results suggest that immune factors may play a role in the development of depression.
The authors highlight the role of clinical polymorphism of depression that makes it difficult to form homogenous groups of patients and to select phenotypes for biological studies.
