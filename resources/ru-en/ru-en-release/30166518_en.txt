[The role of fixed dose combinations in the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma].
A great number of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma require combination therapy with several hypotensive drugs of different pharmacological groups to efficiently compensate the intraocular pressure (IOP) and prevent further development of glaucoma.
Although glaucoma treatment usually starts with monotherapy, several preparations administered simultaneously have stronger hypotensive effect further increased by their additive action.
However, the increased frequency of instillations may lead to drug washout and decreased patient compliance.  Fixed dose combinations (FDCs) are a pharmacological form of eye drops that combines two or more active drugs in a single dosage form.
The frequency of FDCs administration does not exceed two per day, which is convenient for long-term application and helps improve patient compliance.
FDCs tolerability tends to be higher than that of simultaneous instillations of separate monotherapy drugs, while the hypotensive in clinical trials is comparable, in some real practice trials is superior.
A review of existing studies showed that FDCs are superior to monotherapy in terms of cost-effectiveness.
The use of FDCs was found to be beneficial for glaucoma treatment from the viewpoints of both reaching the target IOP for preserving visual functions in glaucoma patients, and minimizing the long-term treatment costs.
