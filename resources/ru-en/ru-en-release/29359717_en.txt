[Neuropsychological evaluation of children in low conciseness state after a severe traumatic brain injury].
AIM  To follow up patterns of cognitive recovery in children (6-17 years of age) at the first four months after a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Seventeen children with TBI (GCS â‰¤8) were evaluated with the Coma Recovery Scale-R (CRS).  Children were stratified into three groups according to their consciousness recovery.
Seven children regained their consciousness completely and were assessed by the Luria Neuropsychological Battery test.
Six children remained in the minimally conscious state (MCS) and were tested by the adapted procedure of neuropsychological assessment during the first four months.  Four children with low level of consciousness were evaluated with CRS.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The most destroying functions at the early recovery period were the processing speed (neurodynamics of mental activity), executive functions and memory.  Children with the anterior cortex damage had the slowest dynamics of recovery.
The slower dynamics of consciousness recovery was combined with severe primary damages of visual gnosis, speech and executive functions according to neuropsychological examination.
The positive dynamics of consciousness recovery was combined with early behavioral changes and the greater rate of behavioral changes.
