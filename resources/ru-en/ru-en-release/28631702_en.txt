[The frequency of ophthalmologic manifestations of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and their relationship to systemic diseases].
AIM  To estimate the frequency of lesions in the organ of vision in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegener's) and to determine their relationship to systemic diseases.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The retrospective study enrolled 218 patients followed up at the E.M. Tareyev Clinic of Nephrology, Internal and Occupational Diseases, with a diagnosis of GPA.
The frequency and association of ophthalmic manifestations with systemic involvement were statistically analyzed using PASW Statistics 18.
RESULTS
The organ of vision was impaired in 48.1% of the patients with GPA.
The most common manifestations were orbital space-occupying lesion (22.9%), conjunctivitis/episcleritis (14.7%), dacryocystitis (6.0%), and scleritis (4.6%).
Orbital space-occupying lesions occurred more frequently in the local type of the disease (p=0.0003), and, on the contrary, the involvement of the conjunctiva and eyeball was seen in patients with the systemic types of GPA (p=0.02).
CONCLUSION
The findings may suggest that the orbital lesion is an independent manifestation of GPA, which develops more commonly in its local type.
Conjunctivitis/episcleritis is, on the contrary, more frequently seen in the active phase of the disease and generally in the involvement of other organs and systems.
