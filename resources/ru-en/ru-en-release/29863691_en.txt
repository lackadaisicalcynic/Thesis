[The experience of using cellex in treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke].  AIM
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of cellex with basic therapy in patients with ischemic stroke in the acute stage.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
An analytical prospective, randomized, simple, blind study included 52 patients with ischemic stroke.
The main group of patients (n=26) was treated with basic therapy, which included hypotensive drugs, antiaggregants or anticoagulants depending on the concomitant pathology as well as vascular medications.
In addition the patients received cellex in dose 0.1 mg daily during 10 days.
The control group (n=26) received basic therapy.
Along with assessment of neurological status, the Glasgow coma scale, the National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), the Barthel Index, the modified Rankin Scale, the MMSE, the Speech Function Score Scale, Speech Questionnaire were used on admission to the hospital, on the 5th, 10th day and on the day of discharge.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A positive influence of cellex on the restoration of neurologic functions, mainly motor functions, was observed.
Cellex has a good tolerability profile.  The use of cellex together with basic therapy of ischemic stroke allows shortening the period of hospitalization.
