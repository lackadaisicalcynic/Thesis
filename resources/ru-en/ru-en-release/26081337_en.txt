[Experience of using interferon Î’-1a biosimilans (cinnovex and genfaxon-44) in the Moscow Multiple Sclerosis Center].
OBJECTIVE
To study the efficacy and tolerability of generics (interferon beta-1a biosimilans) cinnovex for intramascular introduction and genfaxon-44 for subcutaneous injections in multiple sclerosis (MS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred patients were treated with cinnovex and 104 patients were treated with genfaxon-44 during one year.  Patient's status was assessed using clinical approach, psychometric scales and MRI.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The high percentage of withdrawal of treatment due to the lack of clinical effect and intolerance to the drugs was identified during the treatment.
Positive effect with respect to stabilization of MS course was found only in patients who earlier did not receive disease-modifying drugs.  Double-blind studies are needed to resolve the question of the adequacy of brand-name drugs and generics.
