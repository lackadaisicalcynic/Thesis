[The importance of marker proteins of the nervous tissue for morphological diagnostics of the craniocerebral injury].  The present review of the literature involves 50 publications concerning various substrates of importance as the biological markers of axonal damages with special reference to the secondary molecular and cellular mechanisms on which to base in vitro and in vivo modeling of the craniocerebral injury.
The results of the investigations with the application of mass-spectrometry for the identification of the proteins specifically synthesized in response to the injury are presented; their biological functions are described.
The use of the sequential microscopic imaging technique and the immunohistochemical methods made it possible to determine that the majority of the marker proteins are involved in the specific intracellular processes that are triggered in response to the traumatic impact including apoptosis, proliferation, formation of lamellipodia, axon regeneration, actin remodeling, cell migration and inflammation.  In addition, a rise in the amount of intracellular actin-associated proteins has been observed.
It is concluded that the investigations into the properties and the physiological role of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) are of special value for the characteristic of nervous tissue damages and morphological diagnostics of the craniocerebral injury.
