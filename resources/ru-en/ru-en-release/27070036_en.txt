[The distribution of tropicamide in the body of warm-blooded animals after its intragastric administration].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the peculiar features of the distribution of N-ethyl-3-hydroxy-2-phenyl-N-(piridin-4-yl-methyl)propanamide (tropicamide) in the body of warm-blooded animals (rats) after its intragastric administration.
The following methods were employed in the study: TLC, chromogenic reactions, electronic spectrophotometry, and GC-MS.
The results of the quantitative analysis of N-ethyl-3-hydroxy-2-phenyl-N-(piridin-4-yl-methyl)propanamide in different organs of warm-blooded animals (rats) were compared within 20 minutes, 2.5 and 6 hours after its single intragastric administration at a dose equivalent to 1.5 LD50 of the toxic substance.
It was shown that at all time intervals the maximum amount of tropicamide was present in the tissues of the stomach.  Small intestines, their contents, brain, lungs, and spleen.
