AIM  To compare results of rectosacropexy and posterior-loop rectopexy in rectal prolapse management.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study included 122 patients operated for rectal prolapse for the period January 2007 to August 2014.
Patients' age ranged from 19 to 85 years (mean 47.3Â±16.1).
Main group consisted of 60 (49.2%) patients who underwent rectosacropexy (D'Hoore's procedure).
Control group included 62 (50.8%) patients in whom posterior-loop rectopexy was applied (Wells's procedure).
RESULTS
Long-term results were followed-up in 94 (77.0%) patients including 48 and 46 from main and control group respectively.
Recurrent prolaple incidence after rectosacropexy and posterior-loop rectopexy was 2% and 8.7% respectively.
Multivariant analysis statistically confirmed that postoperative impaired colon motility was independent risk factor of recurrence.
Recurrent disease is observed 5.7 times more often in this case.
Rectosacropexy does not significantly impair colon motility because of ileus occurs in 8.3% of operated patients.
Impovement of anal continence does not depend on rectopexy method and occurs in all patients with degree 1-2 of anal sphincter failure.
CONCLUSION
Rectosacropexy may be preferred in rectal prolapse.  However, further highly significant studies are necessary to optimize rectal prolapse management.
