[Prognostic significance of leukocyte count in the venous blood in the acute stage of cerebral aneurism rupture].
AIM  To determine a prognostic role of leukocyte count in the venous blood in the acute stage of cerebral aneurysm (CA) rupture.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-one patients with CA rupture, aged from 20 to 65 years, hospitalized in the first 72 h over the period from 01.10.12 to 01.02.16 were examined.
The severity of disease and anatomical form of hemorrhage was corresponded to III-IV degree on the W. Hunt - R. Hess scale and Fisher scale.
All patients underwent surgery.
Outcomes after open and endovascular surgeries were similar.
RESULTS
Normal leukocyte number in the venous blood at admission was identified in 12 (24%) of patients (on average 7.3±1.4·109/L), leukocytosis in 39 (76%) (14.3±3.1·109/L)
(p<0.0001).
Leukocyte number in the acute stage of CA rupture was correlated with the frequency and severity of the vessel spasm.
In 28 (55%) of patients with ischemic lesions of the brain matter, mean leukocyte number in the first 72 h after hemorrhage was higher by 2-24% (3±4.8·109/L) compared to patients without ischemia (11.9±2.5·109/L) (p=0.06). The level of leukocytes in survivors was lower by 3 - 28% (122±3.4·109/L) compared to patients with fatal outcome and patients with severe neurological deficit after the surgery (14.5±3.9·109/L) (p>0.05).  CONCLUSION
The increase in leukocyte number in the venous blood in the first 72 h after CA rupture ≥10,1·109/L is a reliable risk factor of marked vessel spasm.  The level of leukocytes in patients with cerebral ischemia and poor prognosis in the first 72h after aneurysmal hemorrhage was higher by 2-28% compared to survivors without neurological impairment or mild neurological deficit.
