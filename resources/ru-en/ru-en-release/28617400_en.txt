[Teeth wedge-shaped defects in adults of different age groups: remark to prevention and treatment].  The aim of the study was to assess the treatment of teeth wedge defects in different age groups.
Records of 383 patients (125 males and 258 females aged 22-85 years) treated in outpatient dental facilities with different ownership forms.  It is shown that the medical care of patients with wedge-shaped teeth defects routinely consists of remineralization therapy and restoration of anatomical teeth shape regardless of the form of ownership.
The extensiveness of dental rehabilitation as well as the use of more modern technologies are typical for private clinics and 96-100% of patients finished their treatment there.
In the state and departmental institutions complete rehabilitation of wedge-shaped defects was provided in 45.5-58.0% and 54.3-83.9, respectively.  The paper also highlights the drawbacks of primary medical documentation identified in medical institutions of all forms of ownership.
