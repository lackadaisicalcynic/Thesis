AIM  To evaluate the effectiveness of complex rehabilitation of post stroke patients in a Stroke Rehabilitation Centre.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of rehabilitative treatment of 86 patients, aged from 50 to 68 years, in early and late recovery periods of ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery were analyzed.
Neurological deficit was assessed with the Scandinavian Stroke Scale, the dynamics of recovery of neurological disorder with Barthel daily activity index, the degree of misbalance with the modified Rankin scale.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
After the rehabilitation, a decrease in neurological deficit, improvement of gait and self-service skills, decrease in disability level were observed.
The average scores before and after rehabilitation were 35.9±3.9 and 42.7±4.1 on the Scandinavian Stroke Scale, 41.8±4.9 and 52.4±4.4 on Barthel index, 3.3±0.6 and 2.5±0.5 on the modified Rankin scale, respectively.
The importance of complex multidisciplinary approach to rehabilitative measures is emphasized.
