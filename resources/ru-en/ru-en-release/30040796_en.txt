[Diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia: the results of observational Russian program DIAMANT].  AIM
To investigate the efficacy of divaza in outpatients with cognitive disorders and chronic brain ischemia (CBI).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The non-interventional observational program included the data of 2583 outpatients with CBI from 30 cities (8 federal okrugs of the Russian Federation) who were on outpatient neurological treatment and received divaza in a dose of 2 tablets three times a day from Oct 2016 to Jan 2017.
Cognitive functions were evaluated using the MoCA scale before and after 3 months of treatment.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Cognitive disorders were identified in 90.7% of patients (<26 MoCA scores).
After treatment, the mean MoCA score increased from 19.58±5.13 to 23.99±4.21 (p<0.0001), the number of patients with normal cognitive functions rate (≥26 scores) increased from 9.3 to 41.3%, the number of patients with marked cognitive impairment decreased.
The drug was well-tolerated by old and very old patients, adverse events were observed rarely (0.6% of cases).
The majority of doctors (88.4%) noticed the effect of divaza as significant improvement or improvement, and 89.6% of patients valued the effect to be excellent or good.
The use of divaza, the drug with endothelioprotective and nootropic effects, is pathogenetically justified and promising in patients with cognitive disorders of vascular etiology.
