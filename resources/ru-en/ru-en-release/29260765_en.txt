[Somatic pathology as a negative factor of enamel resistance of the permanent teeth].  According to a survey of 292 children of 7, 12 and 15 years from Lviv it was assessed the resistance of enamel of permanent teeth by various somatic diseases.
Caries susceptible enamel was most frequently revealed in children with gastrointestinal diseases and allergic diseases (66.67±12.17 and 83.33±10.76%, respectively), as well as endocrine disorders (55.00±7.87%).
In children with musculoskeletal system diseases caries resistant and conditionally caries resistant enamel (23.08±8.26 and 26.92±8.70%) was seen two times less than caries susceptible enamel (50.00±9.81%, p1<0.001, p2<0,001).
The findings suggest that the somatic pathology reduced structural and functional resistance of enamel, which leads to lower resistance of dental hard tissues under the influence of cariogenic factors.
