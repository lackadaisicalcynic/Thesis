[An effect of disease-modifying drugs on the development of children born to mothers with multiple sclerosis].
AIM
To evaluate an effect of mother's treatment with disease-modifying drugs (DMD) on the mental and physical development of the child in the first year of life.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty pregnancies resulted in birth of live babies in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were studied.  The diagnosis of MS was made to the mother before conception of the child.
Seven mothers did not receive DMD at the moment of conception (controls), 13 mother were treated with interferon-beta (IFN) and 10 with glatiramer acetate.  A structure interview, examination of the child with the assessment of common anthropometric indices, the WHO scale for achievement of six milestones, medical history and statistical analysis were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The data on the negative effect of MS on the growth and development of the fetus and the positive impact of treatment of the mother with DMD in the early stages of pregnancy on anthropometric indices and development of the child in the first year of life were confirmed.
It has been concluded that DMD positively influence the disease course of the female patient and potentially improve the prognosis for her future offspring.
