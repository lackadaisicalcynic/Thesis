[Dichotomous classification of autism spectrum disorders: syndromal and non-syndromal forms].  In foreign literature on research into the etiopathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), the division of this group of diseases into two forms is getting more and more frequent.
These two forms are 'syndromal' and 'non-syndromal' forms of autistic disorders.  The literature review aims to cover the issues of the dichotomous classification of ASDs based on the genetic and molecular psychiatric views on the etiopathogenesis of this group of diseases.
It also covers the purpose of this classification, the opportunities of its usage in routine clinical practice and the network resources, which allow classifying a form of ASD correctly.  Special attention is paid to the multidisciplinary approach to dichotomous classification and its difference from the clinical view on the systematization of autism and the importance of this method for selection of target therapy.
