[Treatment of depression complicated by abuse and dependence on alcohol].
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy of different treatment regimens of depression complicated by abuse and dependence on alcohol and to identify the most effective tactics of treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred patients with depression were studied.
Examination of patients was conducted using clinical-psychopathological method, the MADRS (at admission, on the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th week of treatment) and CGI scale (in the beginning of treatment and on 6th week).  Data analysis using standard statistical indicators was performed.
In accordance with the therapeutic tactics, patients were stratified into three groups: patients, treated with a combination of antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers (group 1); antidepressants and antipsychotics (group 2); antidepressants and mood stabilizers (group 3).
RESULTS  In group 1, a reduction in MADRS scores was significantly higher compared to other groups (8.53 points, pâ‰¤0.01).
On the 6th week, 50% of the patients showed complete or almost complete remission, and the state of 44.7% patients was classified as 'mild disorders'.  In group 3, serious condition remained in 16.7% of patients by the end of the 6th week.
By the 6th week of treatment, 39.5% of patients of group 1 had 'very significant improvement'.  The least treatment efficacy was noted in group 3.
CONCLUSION
The use of the combination of antidepressants, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers demonstrates the greatest efficacy in terms of reduction of depressive symptoms.
