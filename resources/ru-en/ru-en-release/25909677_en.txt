[The specific features of vegetative disorders in the children presenting with rhinosinusitis].
The authors examined 79 children presenting with rhinosinusitis.  The objective of the study was to evaluate the state of the autonomous nervous system in these patients.
The vegetative tone was determined with the use of the Wayne tables and questionnaires based on the results of the Preveli and Danielopulo tests.
The functional condition of the myocardium was assessed by ECG and echocardiography.  It was shown that the acute period of rhinosinusitis was more frequently associated with the development of asthenoneurotic syndrome, emotional lability, and changes of arterial pressure than with other symptoms of vegetative dysfunction.
The pathological changes suggesting the functional disorders were recorded on ECG in 63.3% of the patients while the echocardiographic studies revealed alterations in the valvular apparatus in 40.5% of the cases.
