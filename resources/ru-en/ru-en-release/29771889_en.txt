[Bioinorganic chemical composition of the lens and methods of its investigation].  Bioinorganic chemical composition of the lens of human and experimental animals (cows, dogs, rats, rabbits) have been analyzed in various studies.
In most cases, the studies employed different methods to determine the gross (total) composition of chemical elements and their concentrations in the examined samples.  Less frequently, they included an assessment of the distribution of chemical elements in the lens and correlation of their concentration with its morphological changes.
Chemical elements from all groups (series) of the periodic classification system were discovered in the lens substance.  Despite similar investigation methods, different authors obtained contradicting results on the chemical composition of the lens.
This article presents data suggesting possible correlation between inorganic chemical elements in the lens substance with the development and formation of lenticular opacities.
All currently employed methods are known to only analyze limited number of select chemical elements in the tissues and do not consider the whole range of elements that can be analyzed with existing technology; furthermore, the majority of studies are conducted on the animal model lens.
Therefore, it is feasible to continue the development of the chemical microanalysis method by increasing the sensitivity of Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) with the purpose of assessing the gross chemical composition and distribution of the elements in the lens substance, as well as revealing possible correlation between element concentration and morphological changes in the lens.
