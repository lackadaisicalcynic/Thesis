OBJECTIVE
to identify and give an objective assessment of all changes in the periorbital region in paralysis orbicularis oculi muscle.  METHODS
With physical, laboratory and instrumental methods of research, we analyzed the survey of 33 patients with paralytic lagophthalmos.
This survey has allowed us to identify the symptoms of periorbital changes characteristic of paralysis orbicularis oculi involved in lagophthalmos development.  RESULTS
After analyzing the results of a survey of 33 patients with paralytic lagophthalmos, we identified 15 symptoms of changes in the periorbital region.  CONCLUSION
In our opinion, lagophthalmos should be considered as a syndrome, including certain symptom in a particular case.  For adequate closure of the optic fissure and obtaining a good aesthetic result is necessary to simultaneously remove more of the symptoms.
