[Treatment of chronic cerebral venous insufficiency: a study on an effect of L-lysine aescinat].
AIM  To study an effect of L-lysine aescinat on the dynamics of complaints, severity of neurological syndromes and parameters of cerebral blood flow estimated by transcranial doppler and duplex scanning in patients with chronic cerebral venous insufficiency (CCVI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty patients with ultrasound-confirmed CCVI were examined.
The basic group included 40 patients who received two treatment courses (intravenous drop-by-drop/stream introductions of L-lysine aescinat in the dose of 5ml during 7 days in 2nd and 30th days of examination).  The comparison group consisted of 40 patients.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Treatment with L-lysine aescinat led to the significant decrease in complaints and improved the scores on the scales used in the study.
There was an improvement in the cerebral hemodynamics (an increase of hemodynamic reserve and normalization of the linear blood flow velocity in deep veins) in the patients with CCVI.
The safe profile of L-lysine aescinat used in recommended doses was confirmed.
