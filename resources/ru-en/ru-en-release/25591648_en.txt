[Cognitive impairment in depression and potential applications of antidepressants with procognitive effects].
The characteristics of cognitive impairment in depression are reviewed.  Data of literature indicate that cognitive impairment may serve as a predictor of depression recurrence and poor prognosis of antidepressant therapy.
In this view, we consider the importance of assessment of cognitive impairment and differential use of medications with precognitive effect (bupropion, vorteoxetine and some SSRI antidepressants as well as fluvoxamine, which is a potent agonist of the sigma-1-receptor).
