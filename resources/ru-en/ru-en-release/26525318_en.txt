[The prevention and treatment of nasal liquorrhea in transnasal surgery of the base of the skull].  The objective of the present study was to estimate the effectiveness of different methods for the reconstruction of defects in the base of the skull.
It was shown that the use of the modern technique for this purpose decreases the risk of the development of postoperative complications.
The vascularized flaps can be applied to hermetically close defects in the base of the skull during surgery with the use of the extended transnasal approach.
It is concluded that the proposed procedure accelerates the healing process and allows the flaps to be used repeatedly if necessary.
