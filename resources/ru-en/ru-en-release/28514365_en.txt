[The detection of the human papilloma virus during hyperplastic processes in the nose, ears and throat].  The objective of the present work was to carry out the virological and histological studies of various neoplastic and hyperplastic processes in the nose, ears, and throat with a view to identifying the presence of human papilloma virus and Epstein-Barr virus.
The brush biopsies and remote neoplasms obtained from 18 patients (including 2 children and 16 adults) presenting with various ENT diseases and tumours were available for the virological investigation with the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a system MY09-MY11 degenerate primers .
The histological study of biopsies and remote neoplasms was carried out by means of conventional light microscopy.
The virological and histological studies conducted in parallel confirmed the diagnostic significance of morphological changes at the tissue and cellular levels caused by the human papilloma virus.
