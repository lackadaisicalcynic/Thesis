[Indicators of apoptosis in the gastric mucosa in patients with atrophic gastritis among the indigenous and nonindigenous dwellers of Evenkia].  AIM
To study the indicators of apoptosis in the gastric mucosa (GM) in relation to atrophy and the presence of CagA gene- containing Helicobacter pylori strains in the indigenous and nonindigenous dwellers of Evenkia.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Clinical and morphological examinations and fibrogastroscopy of GM were performed in 159 Caucasians and 136 Mongoloids (Evenks).
The TUNEL assay was used to determine GM apoptosis in 24 Caucasians and 22 Evenks and the H. pylori strains containing the CagA gene were detected in all the 295 patients.
RESULTS
The extent of atrophic gastritis in the gastric antrum and body was higher in the Caucasians than in the Evenks.
The total indicator of GM apoptosis in the gastric antrum was 5.19 ± 0.26% in the newcomers and 4.04 ± 0.28% in the aboriginals (p = 0.01).
Apoptosis in both populations was associated with GM atrophy and the presence of H. pylori strains containing CagA gene.
CONCLUSION  There were ethnic differences in the extent of atrophic gastritis, which may be attributable to differences in the rate of GM apoptosis and the spread of H. pylori strains containing CagA gene in the indigenous and non-indigenous dwellers of Evenkia.
