[Age-related changes in blood microcirculation functional state of the brain cortex of rats].  Male Wistar-Kyoto rats, aged 22-24 months, were intracerebrally transplanted syngeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).
Cognitive functions of these animals were tested in 3 weeks.
The density of microvascular bed, the tissue blood flow, saturation of mixed blood in cortex microvessels were measured under the standard conditions, under the impact of noradrenaline and in the context of global ischemia.
The control groups consisted of rats aged 2-3 months and 22-24 months.  MSC transplantation have a positive impact on the microcirculation in brain cortex of old animals: reduction of vascular density was prevented, level of saturation in the blood vessels was increased, which enabled animals to endure easier extreme impacts, but did not correct age-related deterioration of cognitive functions.
