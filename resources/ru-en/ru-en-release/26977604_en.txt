The role of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in prediction of postoperative atrial fibrillation.
AIM
To analyze prognostic value of different factors in postoperative atrial fibrillation prediction.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study included 39 patients with coronary artery disease without previous paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  Multiple correlation, logistic regression and ROC-analysis were performed to create predictive model of postoperative atrial fibrillation prognosis.
Authors have analyzed most of described in literature preoperative predictors of atrial fibrillation to define the role of different risk factors.  Prognostic role of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is assessed.
RESULTS
We revealed high informativeness of NT-proBNP to predict postoperative atrial fibrillation after on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.
