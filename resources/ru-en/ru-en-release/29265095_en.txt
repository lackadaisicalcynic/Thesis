[The quality of research publications in psychiatry].
AIM  To evaluate the quality of research articles in psychiatry and addiction medicine published in 2015.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Five experts analyzed 51 research publications from 13 psychiatric and addiction medicine journals using a standardized questionnaire, which contains 4 general questions (type or results of the study) and 21 questions on the quality of the study.
RESULTS
Only 2 articles (4%) met all criteria, 64% of the articles refer to the methodologically least demonstrative (uncontrolled/one-time, series of cases, non-randomized).
The most vulnerable were the characteristics which were the most important for evidence: a description of the methods, statistical analysis, accounting for systematic errors and/or side effects, the distribution of patients by group.
CONCLUSION
Research publications in psychiatry and addiction medicine have a low level of evidence.
