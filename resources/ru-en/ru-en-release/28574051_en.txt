[Stagewise hybrid method of treating a patient with connective tissue dysplasia, aortic aneurysm, and distal dissection].  Presented herein is a clinical case report concerning the use of a hybrid technique in stagewise surgical management of a patient with distal dissection and an aneurysm of the thoracoabdominal portion of the aorta.
The patient at high risk with the connective tissue dysplasia syndrome had a past medical history of prosthetic repair of the descending thoracic aorta with type-1 haemodynamic correction.
Three years later, the findings of computed tomography demonstrated fenestration in the area of the distal anastomosis, a patent false channel, and an increase in the diameter of the unoperated thoracoabdominal portion of the aorta.
The first stage consisted in performing prosthetic repair of the infrarenal portion of the aorta by means of the multibranched Coselli thoracoabdominal graft, followed by 'switching' the visceral branches into the formed prosthesis.
14 days later, the second stage included stenting of the dilated suprarenal portion of the aorta.
The patient was discharged on day 9 after the second stage of the operation.
This clinical case report demonstrates that a hybrid method of treatment may by an alternative to an open operation in high risk surgical patients presenting with severe concomitant somatic pathology.
