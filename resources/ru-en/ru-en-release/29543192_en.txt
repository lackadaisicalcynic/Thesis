[Late complications of choroidal melanoma brachytherapy and possibility of their prevention].  Complications and the frequency of their occurrence as the criteria of eye preservation after brachytherapy (BT) are presented in literature with inconsistencies due to the assessment being done after varied follow-up periods (1 month to 5-10 years).
The evaluation of complications occurring after applying radioiodine can be found in literature.
The complications after BT beta particle emitting ophthalmic applicators are seldom discussed in articles.  PURPOSE
to examine the frequency of complications, the characteristics of their development after choroidal melanoma (CM) brachytherapy with ruthenium ophthalmic applicators (OA) during long-term follow-up and determine the possibility of their prevention.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Characteristics of postradiation period after BT were studied in 200 patients with CM (200 eyes).
Among them, 127 patients were treated by authors of this study, 73 were provided treatment by other specialized medical facilities in Moscow.
The study involved 84 male and 116 female patients aged 56.14±12.8 in average.  The follow-up periods spanned 2 to 39 years (mean length 9.84±6.16 years).
BT was done only with ruthenium OA (beta radiation) manufactured in Russian.
RESULTS
Follow-up period after BT for 83% of patients was 5 years.
Complications occurred in 68.5% of patients.
Complications were found in 74.63% of patients with CM localized pre-equatorially and in 65.4% of patients with CM localized in the posterior part of the eye.
Complications associated with radiation-induced injuries in crystalline lens, retina and choroidal blood vessels were more frequent.
CONCLUSION
The frequency of complications depends on the size of CM and its localization.
Complications were the least frequent in patients with CM thickness of 5 mm or less.
