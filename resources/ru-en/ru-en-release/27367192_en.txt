[Gender-related marker pathogens of periodontal disease in chronic periodontitis].  By using qPCR system, women as well as men were found to have an equal periodontal pathogen colonization.
However, the women are subjected to have a higher risk of chronic periodontitis onsets.
Women with the chronic periodontitis usually expose an evident hypercolonization with a single pathogen.  P. gingivalis is the most prevalent causative agent of the chronic periodontitis in women but not in men.
In health as well as in the chronic periodontitis a complex of periodontal pathogens forms such as P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, T. forsythensis and T. denticola.
T. forsythensis demonstrates the highest correlation with the chronic periodontitis onset in men.  Our data allow us to prove T. forsythensis playing the key role in the forming of periodontal pathogen complex.
