[The Russian-language version of the matrix test (RUMatrix) in free field in patients after cochlear implantation in the long term].  The deterioration of speech intelligibility in the patients using cochlear implantation (CI) systems is especially well apparent in the noisy environment.
It explains why phrasal speech tests, such as a Matrix sentence test, have become increasingly more popular in the speech audiometry during rehabilitation after CI.  The Matrix test allows to estimate speech perception by the patients in a real life situation.
The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of audiological rehabilitation of CI patients using the Russian-language version of the matrix test (RUMatrix) in free field in the noisy environment.  33 patients aged from 5 to 40 years with a more than 3 year experience of using cochlear implants inserted at the National Research Center for Audiology and Hearing Rehabilitation were included in our study.
Five of these patients were implanted bilaterally.  The results of our study showed a statistically significant improvement of speech intelligibility in the noisy environment after the speech processor adjustment; dynamics of the signal-to-noise ratio changes was -1.7 dB (p<0.001).
The RUMatrix test is a highly efficient method for the estimation of speech intelligibility in the patients undergoing clinical investigations in the noisy environment.  The high degree of comparability of the RUMatrix test with the Matrix tests in other languages makes possible its application in international multicenter studies.
