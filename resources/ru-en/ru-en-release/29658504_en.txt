[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome dynamics during treatment with nooclerin (deanoli aceglumas)].
AIM  To study the efficacy of nooclerin (deanoli aceglumas) in alcohol withdrawal syndrome assessed by clinical and biochemical characteristics.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A multicenter, open, randomized, comparative study of nooclerin in the complex treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome included 90 patients.
The patients were randomized into nooclerin group (n=55) and control group (n=35).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Nooclerin reduced alcohol withdrawal symptoms more significantly throughout the whole study period.
There were significant between-group differences on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale (CIWA-Ar) and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (ÐœFI-20).
However, patients exhibited no excessive activity.  No adverse side-effects were observed.
