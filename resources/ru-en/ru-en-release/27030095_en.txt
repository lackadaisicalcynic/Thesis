[The specific features of the distribution of 2,6-di-tret-buthyl-4-methlhydroxybenzole in the organism of the warm-blooded animals].  We have studied the specific features of the distribution of 2,6-di-tret-buthyl-4-methlhydroxybenzole in the organism of the omnivorous warm-blooded animals (rats) following the intragastric administration of the three-fold lethal dose of the poisonous substance.
2,6-di-tret-buthyl-4-methlhydroxybenzole was isolated from the blood and various organs of the animals by means of acetone extraction.
It was further purified on the 40/100 mcm L silicagel column with the use of hexane/acetone for elution.  TLC, GC-MS, and UV-spectrophotometry were employed to identify and quantify the material of interest.
It was shown that 2,6-di-tret-buthyl-4-methlhydroxybenzole undergoes modification in the internal organs and blood of the poisoned animals.  In was present in the highest amounts (100 mg/g) in the stomach and small intestine contents (787.78±52.31 and 18.31±3.47 respectively), spleen (12.46±1.02), and kidneys (8.48±0.61).
