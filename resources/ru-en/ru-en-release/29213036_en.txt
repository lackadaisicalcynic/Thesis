[Pathomorphosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.  Juvenile forms].
AIM  To investigate the pathomorphosis of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) in the aspect of prognosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 1480 patients with epilepsy including 281 patients with IGE.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
'Juvenile' forms were diagnosed in 228 patients.
Relapse of seizures in anamnesis occurred in 19% out of 105 patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME).
Remission was achieved in 59.2% out of 76 patients with long-term follow-up.
Out of 35 patients with juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), relapse of seizures in anamnesis occurred in 25.7%.
Out of 24 patients with long-term follow-up, remission was achieved in 70.8%.
Out of 88 patients with IGE with generalized tonic clonic-seizures, relapse of seizures in anamnesis occurred in 15%.
Out of 60 patients with long-term follow-up, remission was achieved in 86.7%.
The main features of epilepsy pathomorphosis in all groups of patients were the decrease of informativeness of routine EEG, reduction in the frequency and duration of seizures, occurrence of seizures in the discontinuation of therapy and/or under the influence of provoking factors.
