[Liver tissue regeneration under the influence of cryoprecipitate and alloplant].  AIM
To study the effectiveness and impact of cryoprecipitate and alloplant on regeneration of liver tissue in patients with cirrhosis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
114 patients with liver cirrhosis have been treated at the Department of Faculty Surgery of I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University from 2007 to 2014.
Cryoprecipitate and alloplant were injected into cirrhotic liver tissue in the first (72 patients) and second (42 patients) groups under ultrasound control respectively.
Patients' age was 48.9Â±12.14 years (range 18-75).
There were 66 men (58%) and 48 (42%) women.
Mixed (toxic and viral) etiology of cirrhosis was observed in 40.3% of patients, viral--in 25.8%, toxic--in 34.2%.
RESULTS
Minimally invasive treatment under ultrasound showed significant (p>0.05) positive dynamics of hepatocellular failure, cytolytic and cholestatic syndromes, hypersplenism in 3, 6 and 12 months after cryoprecipitate administration in most patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh class A, B and C (group 1).
Alloplant injected into hepatic tissue causes less regeneration of liver tissue.
It improves clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh classes A and B.  In case of class C allopolant is not effective.
