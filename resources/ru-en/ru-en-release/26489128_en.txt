[Triggering factors and pathogenesis of radiation cataract].
Cataract is one of the most common eye diseases in the world.
Many factors, including genetic, metabolic, nutritional, and environmental, are involved in its formation.
It is necessary to know main causal agents and cellular mechanism of cataractogenesis.
The tissue of the lens is considered radiosensitive, thus, lens opacities are possible late effects of exposure to ionizing radiation.
The use of medical radiation for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes grows worldwide.
At the same time, there continues to be much confusion regarding the actual threshold dose of radiation exposure for cataract formation.
Eye safety and the risk of cataract development are not entirely clear.
However, with an ever-widening range of interventional procedures, one should take attempts to reduce the risk for radiation cataract.
