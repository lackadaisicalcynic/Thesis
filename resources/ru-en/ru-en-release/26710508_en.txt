[Forensic medical characteristic of hepatic rupture in the car driver resulting from the injury inflicted inside the passenger compartment].
The objective of the present work was to study morphological changes in the ruptured liver of the car drivers resulting from the injury inflicted inside the passenger compartment.
Special attention was given to the number, localization, and shape of the ruptures as well as their size and direction.  It was shown that the majority of the local ruptures were located in the anterior and the adjoining parts of the liver.
They were rather deep and long, directed longitudinally, and had a linear, sometimes zig-zag or irregular stellar shape.
The local additional ruptures were also found in the frontal part of the liver, they were shorter than and not as deep as the major ones.  These oblique ruptures had an ark-like, angular, linear or zig-zag shape.
Central ruptures of a slit-like shape were most often located close to the adjacent frontal part of the liver.
Shock-proof ruptures were located in the posterior part of the liver.  They were long, deep, and directed longitudinally, had either linear or zig-zag shape.
The peripheral ruptures were located in the middle and posterior parts of the liver.  They were long, rather narrow, and shallow; their distinctive features was the oblique direction, besides a curvilinear or zig-zag shape.
