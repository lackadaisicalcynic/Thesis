[Results and promises of genetics of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia: molecular-genetic approaches].  This review highlights the basic paradigms and directions of molecular genetic studies of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
Along with the traditional approach based on functional candidate genes, it covers genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for cognition in general population and schizophrenic patients, attempts to integrate GWAS results in polygenic profiles that can be used in personalized care of schizophrenic patients, and a search for biological pathways implicated in the development of cognitive impairments with bioinformatics methods.
However, despite significant advances in understanding the genetic basis of the disease and a rapidly growing amount of data on genes associated with cognitive functions, most of the variability of cognitive impairments in patients remains unexplained.  The data on the functional complexity of the genome accumulated in the fields of molecular biology and genetics underscore the importance of studying epigenetic mechanisms of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
