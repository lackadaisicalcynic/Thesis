[Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.  Positions in 2015].

The efficacy of this drug group in patients with chronic HF with preserved left ventricular systolic function and the advent and practical introductions of safer new-generation MCRA remain to be answered.
