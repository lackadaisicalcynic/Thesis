[Age features of mucociliary system the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity of the human].  The mucociliary system of the mucosa of the nasal cavity has a complex structural-functional organization and a wide range of functionality.
Essential components of this system are the motor activity of ciliated epithelium and mucociliary transport time.  With age, the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity undergoes specific changes, detection of which is of practical importance for gerontology and medicine.
This article presents the results of studying the main components of the mucociliary apparatus of the nasal cavity of a person in mature, elderly and senile age, we investigated the relationship of functional changes of the mucociliary system with age-related structural reorganization of the epithelial layer of the nasal mucosa.  Identified critical periods functional mucociliary system of nasal cavity of man: old age (out of definitivno state) and aging (involution of the mucociliary apparatus).
