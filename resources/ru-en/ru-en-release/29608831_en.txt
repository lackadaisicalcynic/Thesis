[Age-related traits of cytogenetic abnormalities in synovial cells of knee-joint in residents of the North of Siberia with arthritis of different etiology depending on the GSTM1 gene polymorphism of glutathion-S-transferase.]  It was studied the frequency of cells with cytogenetic abnormalities in the synovial fluid cells of the knee joint in patients of different age groups suffering from chronic arthritis associated with Lyme borreliosis (CAALB) or post-traumatic arthritis (PTA), depending on the polymorphism of the GSTM1 gene of glutathione-S-transferase.
The study included 135 residents of the north of the Tomsk and Tyumen regions, 68 of whom suffered from CAALB, and the rest of the 67 patients who made up the control group were diagnosed with PTA.
The results of this study have demonstrated that there are significant age-related differences in the frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities of the synovial fluid cells of the knee joint between young and elderly patients of СAALB.
The integrative assessment of clinical and cytogenetic parameters in the group of elderly СAALB patients with mutant GSTM1 (0/0) allele, as compared with the other groups, enable to conclude that there are significant positive correlations between the indices of the severity disruption of articular locomotor function and the frequency of synovial fluid cells with trisomy of chromosome 7.
