[Early carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis in the acute period of ischemic stroke].
AIM  To identify the optimal timing of CEA in patients with hemodynamic significant stenosis of carotid arteries in the acute period of ischemic stroke (IS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Five samples (n=30 911) based on the search results from January 2008 to April 2016 in Russian and English-language scientific databases were analyzed.
The main endpoints of the studies in both groups (repeated stroke, death, cardiac complications, frequency of restenosis) were studied depending on the timing of operative intervention and preoperative selection criteria.
Perioperative morbidity and mortality were analyzed within 30 days after disease onset.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
There are heterogeneous and contradictory information on the safety of CEA in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis in acute period of IS.  Fundamentally, a new individual approach is required to select best candidates for timed surgery after disease onset, taking into account the severity of the condition, risk factors, comorbidity and surgical techniques.
