[Motor-evacuatory function of the gastrointestinal tract in metabolic syndrome].
AIM  To investigate the motor-evacuatory function of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in metabolic syndrome (MS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-eight patients with MS were examined.
In addition to clinical findings, an integrated study of GIT motor function by peripheral electrogastroenterocolography was used.
The specific features of lipid metabolism and hormonal and autonomic status were studied in patients with MS.
RESULTS
The local and systemic clinical signs of small bowel lesions were noted in 82.9% of the patients with MS.
There were elevated blood lipid levels in the presence of hypomotor dyskinesia of the upper GIT portions in the postprandial period.
New pathogenetic trends in the role of hormones and hypersympatheticotonia in impairing the motor function of the small bowel were found in MS.
CONCLUSION
The results of our investigations suggest that the found changes in GIT motor function are an important component of the complex pathogenesis of MS.
