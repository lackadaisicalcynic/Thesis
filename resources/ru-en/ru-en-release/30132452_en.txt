[Post-stroke rehabilitation training with a brain-computer interface: a clinical and neuropsychological study].
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy of cytoflavin in the treatment of patients with chronic cerebral ischemia and mild cognitive impairment predominantly of vascular origin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Treatment results of 140 patients, aged 60-74, with chronic cerebral ischemia were analyzed.
The main group included 77 patients (35 men and 42 women of average age 66.38±4.64 years) who received cytoflavin throughout the observation period: 2 tablets twice a day 30 minutes before meals.
The comparison group included 63 patients (26 men and 37 women of average age 67.48±5.22 years) who during the whole period of observation received ethyl methyl hydroxypyridine succinate: 2 tablets (250 mg) twice a day, according to the same scheme as in the main group.
Treatment efficacy was assessed by neuropsychological testing and P300 evoked potentials.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
During treatment, there was an improvement in neurophysiological parameters in both groups, which was more pronounced in patients treated with cytoflavin: their P300 amplitude increased by1.3 times in the left hemisphere  (from 9.21 (8.36, 10.11) to 12.41 (10.23, 13.37 μV) and 1,7 times in the right hemisphere (from 6.48 (5.26, 7.35) to 11.04 (9.29, 12.18) μV).
Our study confirms the advisability of using drugs that have complex cytoprotective and energy-correcting mechanism in patients with cognitive impairment.
Cytoflavin has shown the high efficacy and safety and can be recommended as part of complex therapy for cognitive disorders.
Using simple and inexpensive instrumental methods (assessment of cognitive P300 evoked potential) along with diagnostic scales in patients with cognitive impairment can significantly objectify the assessment of treatment dynamics.
