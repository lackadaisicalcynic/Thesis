[Role of viruses with oncogenic potential and their associations in oncogenesis in maxillofacial area].  The potential role of viruses with oncogenic potential such as human papilloma virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, herpes virus type 6, in the development of benign and pre-cancerous tumors of maxillofacial region was assessed in the study.
We examined 26 patients with tumors in maxillofacial region (skin and mucosa) using molecular-genetic and histological studies of surgically removed neoplasms removed.
In 53.8% of the examined samples DNA of Epstein-Barr virus, herpes virus type 6, herpes simplex virus type 1, or cytomegalovirus and in 35.7% of them the association of the above mentioned viruses were detected.  It may confirm their relation with the development of benign, precancerous and malignant neoplasms in maxillofacial region.
