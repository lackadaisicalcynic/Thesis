AIM  to develop a modification to hybrid phacoemulsification (PE) that would involve the use of femtosecond laser.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Modified hybrid PE was performed in 225 patients (267 eyes) with grade II-IV lens nuclei in terms of their density.  Conventional PE was performed in 237 patients (278 eyes).
RESULTS
By utilizing the suggested technique of PE, one can avoid certain problems of conventional surgery and optimize the steps of nucleus fragmentation and emulsification.
CONCLUSIONS
The suggested modification to hybrid PE enables effective removal of grade II-V cataract lenses at minimum ultrasonic load.
