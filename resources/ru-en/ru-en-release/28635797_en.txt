[Treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo].  Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common peripheral vestibular disorder.  BPPV is easily diagnosed by positioning tests and effectively treated by repositioning maneuvers.  The authors focus on the treatment of BPPV, when different canals are affected, including canalo- and cupulolithiasias.
Complications of BPPV and surgery of cases, resistant to conservative treatment, are also discussed.
