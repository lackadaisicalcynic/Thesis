[The age-dependent changes of reproductive function in offspring Drosophila melanogaster.]
It was analyzed a comparative study of age-dependent changes in the parameters of reproductive function and embryonic development of offspring from adults w1c-s, w1Or mutant strains and Canton-S, Oregon-R wild-type strains D. melanogaster.  In investigation three age groups of adult drosophila: 3, 10 and 20-days old were used.
Reciprocal crosses between young and aging parents enable to define the influence of age of the maternal and/or paternal organism on the parameters of reproductive function.  It is shown that the various features of reproductive function in F1 offspring of mutants and wild-type strains are forming differently by the different influence of the age of parents.
The established effect of the white mutation, either as an independent factor or in combination with the parental age, is reflected in the low values of the fertility and viability and high values of dominant lethal mutations and mortality on the metamorphosis stage and consequently the appearance of less adapt and viable offspring in the population.
