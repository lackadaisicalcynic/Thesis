[Endothelium as a target for new therapeutic strategies in cerebral vascular diseases].  The author evaluates a role of endothelium in the pathogenesis of cerebral vascular diseases (CVD) and considers the concept about endothelium as prevention and treatment of pathological processes leading to or triggering CVD.
There are two medical strategies for correction of endothelium dysfunction in CVD: tactic (using of antioxidants) and strategic (statins, hypotensive drugs, antiaggregants).
