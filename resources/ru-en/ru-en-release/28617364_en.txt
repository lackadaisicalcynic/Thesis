[A current view on the MRI diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: an update of 2016 revised MRI criteria].
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the primary method for confirming the clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS).  The article presents the current data on using MRI of the brain and spinal cord for diagnosis in suspected MS.
Special attention is paid to the MRI criteria of McDonald and MAGNIMS for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS) in the latest revisions of 2010 and 2016.
The information provided can help radiologists and neurologists to optimize the use of MRI in clinical practice for diagnosis of MS.
