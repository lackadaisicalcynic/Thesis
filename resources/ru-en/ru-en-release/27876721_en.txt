[Prevention of lingual nerve damage by removing stones from submandibular salivary gland duct].  The aim of the study was to elaborate lingual nerve sparing procedure of submandibular gland duct stones extraction.
The study involved 43 patients with syalolithiasis treated in Oral Surgery Unit of Central Research Institute of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery in 2013-2015.  It was shown that to prevent lingual nerve and artery injury submandibular salivary gland duct should be dissected to the level of obstruction thus allowing adequate visualization of anatomical correlations especially when removing stones from the distal part of the duct.
