[The First Russian Consensus on the Multilevel Abobotulinumtoxin A Injections in Spastic Forms of Cerebral Palsy].  Spasticity treatment is one of the key aspects of the contemporary cerebral palsy (CP) rehabilitation that influences on the effectiveness of other methods.
The paper presents the first Russian document that unites the recommendations for the BTA treatment of CP and could be used as the guideline for the multilevel injections.
The Russian consensus on the multilevel botulinum toxin A (BTA) treatment of spastic CP is based on the international data and the results of national studies.  The authors describe typical CP spasticity patterns in the upper and lower extremities, give recommended intervals for the BTA (Abobotulinum toxin A) dosages for the whole injection procedure and for the separate muscles.
The method of dosage calculation for functional segments is also described.  Attention is paid to the frequency, optimal intervals between the repeated injections and the whole duration of BTA treatment.
The authors discuss effectiveness and safety of BTA, factors that potentially influence the results of the injections, including ultrasound and electromyography control, and indications for the continuation and termination of treatment.
