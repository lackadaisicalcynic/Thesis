[PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE GENE POLYMORPHISMS AND THE PLASMA AND SYNOVIAL FLUID LEVELS OF CYTOKINES IN PATIENTS WITH POST-TRAUMATIC KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS].  Post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis patients (n=117) and healthy people (n=94) were investigated to determine the genotypic and allelic frequency distribution of polymorphic loci Т-31С, С+3953Т IL-1β and G-308A TNF-α.
The plasma and synovial fluid levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α were measured in 31 patients.
The research demonstrated that the blood and synovial fluid levels of IL-1β but not TNF-α were increased in patients with post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis.
Also, the linkage between TNF-α level and polymorphic locus G-308A TNF-α was shown: the presence of allele -308А was associated with decreased TNF-α level.
We demonstrated that polymorphic loci Т-31С, С+3953Т IL-1β and G-308A TNF-α do not predict the higher risk of post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis development in Russian population of Rostov-on-Don region.
