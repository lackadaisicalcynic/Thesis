AIM  to prove the efficacy and safety of video-assisted techniques in diagnosis and treatment of victims with thoracic and abdominal trauma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was analyzed treatment of 249 patients with thoracic (n=82), abdominal (n=122) and thoracoabdominal injuries (n=35) who were divided into 2 groups depending on treatment.
Control group of conventional diagnosis and treatment included 130 (52%) patients.
Group 2 consisted of 119 (48%) patients in whom differentiated surgical approach combined with current technologies was applied.
RESULTS
Video-assisted techniques did not reveal thoracic (n=9) and abdominal (n=7) injuries in 16 out of 103 cases.  There was conversion to open surgery in 20 patients.
In group 2 conventional thoracic (n=15) and abdominal (n=22) interventions were made in 37 (36%) cases while endoscopic surgery was used in other 66 (64%) patients.
Postoperative complications after endoscopy were observed in 8 patients.  There were 2 deaths.
CONCLUSION
Rational and effective use of video-assisted surgery for thoracic and abdominal trauma significantly improves outcomes in these severe patients.
