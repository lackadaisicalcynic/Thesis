[Experimental study of the effect of combined transplantation of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells and hematopoietic stem cells on the regeneration of the intestinal epithelium in the conditions of influence of extreme factors].
The study examined the effect of combined transplantation of multipotent mesenchymal stromal and hematopoietic stem cells on the regeneration of the intestinal epithelium in the conditions of influence of extreme factors.  Obtained in physiological conditions and in the conditions of influence of extreme factors combined transplantation of multipotent mesenchymal stromal and hematopoietic stem cells derived from mature and old animals is accompanied by increased content of epithelial cells of the crypts of the jejunum.
In physiological conditions in mature animals, this effect is realized through the increase of proliferative activity of epithelial cells, while the old - through the inhibition of apoptosis.
In the conditions of influence of extreme factors of the increase in the content of the cell population of the crypts in mature animals is achieved by increasing the proliferative activity and the inhibition of apoptosis of epithelial cells in the old organism through inhibition of apoptosis.
