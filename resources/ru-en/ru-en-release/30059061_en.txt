[Sleep-disordered breathing in motor neuron disease].
AIM  To study sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in patients with motor neuron disease (MND).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ninety-two patients, 50 women and 42 men, were examined Median age was 62 [55; 67.5] years, MND duration 12 [8.9; 27.1] months.
The control group consisted of 46 patients (26 men; 20 women).
A portable polysomnographic study (PSG) (Polymate YH-1000C (BMC, China)) was conducted immediately after the diagnosis of MND, that is, at a relatively early stage.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Significant changes in PSG in comparison with the control have been revealed.
Significant differences were found between the results of PSG in MND patients with different disease onsets.
The most vulnerable to the development of SDB were patients with bulbar onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Minimal SpO2, index of desaturation, duration of apnea can serve as markers for the analysis of SDB during screening studies based on established correlations.
