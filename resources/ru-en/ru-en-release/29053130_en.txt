Based on the original literature, the author for the first time describes a history of selective serotonergic antidepressants simultaneously inhibiting the serotonin reuptake and directly interacting with serotonin receptors.  A history of creation and introduction of their main representatives is presented.
A history of investigation of their neurochemical activity is analyzed in details.  The history of the evolution of their classifications is systemized.
The data presented suggest the rationale for unifying all selective serotonergic antidepressants, simultaneously inhibiting the serotonin reuptake and directly interacting with serotonin receptors (trazodone, etoperidone, nefazodone, vilazodone, vortioxetine), in one group of 'multimodal serotonergic antidepressants'.  The expediency to include this group in the modern neurochemical classification of nootropic drugs is substantiated.
