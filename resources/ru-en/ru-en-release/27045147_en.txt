[Phospholipids metabolism disorders in acute stroke].  The disturbances of cerebral circulation results in the violation of phospholipid metabolism.
Activation of lipid peroxidation and protein kinase C and release of intracellular calcium leads to disruption of the homeostasis of phosphatidylcholine.
The use of cytidine-5-diphosphocholine, which is used as an intermediate compound in the biosynthesis of phospholipids of the cell membrane, helps to stabilize cell membranes, and reduce the formation of free radicals.
