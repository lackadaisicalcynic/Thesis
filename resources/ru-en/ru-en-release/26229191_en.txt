Midterm review of national health plans: an example from the United Republic of Tanzania.
In the health sector, planning and resource allocation at country level are mainly guided by national plans.
For each such plan, a midterm review of progress is important for policy-makers since the review can inform the second half of the plan's implementation and provide a situation analysis on which the subsequent plan can be based.  The review should include a comprehensive analysis using recent data - from surveys, facility and administrative databases - and global health estimates.
Any midterm analysis of progress is best conducted by a team comprising representatives of government agencies, independent national institutions and global health organizations.
Here we present an example of such a review, done in 2013 in the United Republic of Tanzania.  Compared to similar countries, the results of this midterm review showed good progress in all health indicators except skilled birth attendance.
