[Age dynamics of secretory, absorptive, buffer ability of the mucosa inside the human nose].  The problem of age-related functional changes of organs and systems of the human body is one of the urgent problems of modern physiology and gerontology.
The most important, complex system of human body is respiratory system, especially its «first line of defense» - the nasal cavity.
Functional parameters of the nasal cavity undergo a number of specific changesat the stages of postnatal ontogenesis, the study of which has not only scientific value but also practical value for experimental physiology and clinical medicine.
The article presents data on the age dynamics and adaptability of such functional parameters of the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity of the person, as secretory and suction activity, the air heater function, the buffer properties by endonasal secret.
These indicators are examined at the stages of postnatal development in a comparative perspective based on the study of the age gradients.
