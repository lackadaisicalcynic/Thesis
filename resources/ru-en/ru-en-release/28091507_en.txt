[Alterations of serum neurospecific proteins concentrations in patients with metabolic syndrome].  AIM
Metabolic syndrome (MS) - is a complex of metabolic, hormonal and clinical disorders which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  The study aimed to determine the markers NSE, GFAP, MMP-9 in patients with MS and to assess their prognostic value in the development of acute stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A cross-sectional analytical studyincluded 157 patients stratified into 4groups (control group, patients with MS, patients with ischemic stroke and patients with ischemic stroke and MS).
Laboratory examinations included measurements of MS parameters(total cholesterol, blood glucose, cholesterol, HDL and LDL, triglycerides) and concentrations of neurospecific markers NSE, GFAP and MMP-9 by ELISA.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A relationship between MS and increased concentration of NSE is found.  This indicates the presence of neuronal brain injury in patients with metabolic syndrome.
There were no changesin the concentrations of GFAP and MMP-9 in patients with MS.
