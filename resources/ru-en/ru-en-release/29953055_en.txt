[The comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatment of the patients presenting with the sub-compensated form of chronic tonsillitis making use of the antiseptic herbal medicinal product in the combination with the standard conservative therapy: the results of the open randomized study].  The objective of the present study was the comparison of the effectiveness of the application of tonsilgon-N in the combination with the physical methods for sanitization of the palatine tonsil lagunes with that of the standard conservative treatment.
A total of 60 patients having the confirmed diagnosis of sub-compensated form of chronic tonsillitis were recruited to participate in the study.  All the patients were divided into two groups.
Group 1 was comprised of 30 patients to whom tonsilgon-N was prescribed for the oral administration (25 droplets thrice daily for 30 days) in the combination with lagune cleansing with the use of the Tonsillor apparatus during 30 days (a total of 10 procedures).  Group 2 consisted of 30 patients to whom only 10 sessions of rinsing the palatine tonsil lagunes were prescribed.
The inoculums taken from the tonsils of the patients of group 1 contained no Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and Moraxella catarhalis on the 15th day after the initiation of the treatment whereas the presence of the persisting pathogenic bacterial species was documented in 23.3% of the patients of this group.
10% of the patients in group 2 were found to retain Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Moraxella catarhalis in their tonsils whereas the rate of isolation of the pathogenic biotope amounted to 36,6%.
