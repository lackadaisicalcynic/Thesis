AIM  To investigate the complications of intestinal stoma in children and to develop measures for decrease of their incidence.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 152 children with congenital and acquired gastrointestinal pathology requiring surgical treatment with the imposition of intestinal stoma.
Atresia of intestinal tube was observed in 28 (18.4%) children, meconium ileus - in 10 (6.6%) cases, Hirschsprung's disease - in 11 (7.2%)cases, anorectal malformations - in 39 (25.7%) cases, multiple malformations - in 11 (7.2%) patients, necrotic enterocolitis - in 56 (36.8%) patients, other reasons - in 7 (4.6%) cases.
The average age of patients was 12,3±7,2 days.
There were 93 (61.2%) boys and 59 (38.8%) girls.
Ileostomy, ileocolostomy and colostomy were made in 37 (24.3%), 46 (30.3%) and 69 (45.4%) cases respectively.
Time of intestinal stoma function was 18-217 days.
RESULTS
Early complications were dehiscence in the area of stoma in 4 (2.6%) children, evagination in 7 (4.6%) patients, marginal necrosis of stoma in 2 (1.3%) cases, retraction of stomy into abdominal cavity in 1 (0.6%) child and abdominal skin maceration in 8 (5.2%) patients.
Remote complications included dermatitis around stomy in 35 (23.1%) children, stenosis of stoma in 9 (5.9%) cases, evagination of stoma in 12 (7.9%) patients.
Also, 5 patients were unable to use the colostomy bag due to vicious overlaying of intestinal stoma.
Using the colostomy bags «Coloplast» and skin care products around the stoma significantly reduced (p<0.01) the number of complications at inpatient stage of treatment.
CONCLUSION
Successful function of stoma depends on not only technical aspects but also obligatory care performance with timely correction of complications.
