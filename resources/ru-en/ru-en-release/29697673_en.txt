[Solitary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma concurrent with nodular parenchymal amyloidosis of the lung and Rosai-Dorfman disease].
The paper describes a case of solitary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma concurrent with nodular parenchymal AL amyloidosis of the lung and Rosai-Dorfman disease in a 70-year-old woman.
The core of the tumor was represented by bone tissue with dendriform ossification, as well as by amyloid that showed green apple birefringence at polarized light microscopy.
The peripheral portions of the tumor and the myxohyaline stroma exhibited slit-like structures, epithelioid and fusiform cells with small cytoplasmic vacuoles.  These cells expressed CD31, CD34, factor VIII, and cytokeratins 7 and 18.
The Ki-67 proliferation index was 10%.  S100- and CD68-positive histiocytes with the phenomenon of emperipolesis were revealed in the tumor and in the lymph nodes of the mediastinum and lung hilum.
There was a positive reaction to immunoglobulin lambda light chains in the lymphocytic infiltration around amyloid clumps.
The frequency of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma was less than 1 case per million people annually.  We found only one case of its concurrence with pulmonary amyloidosis in the English-language literature.
No relationship could be revealed between this tumor and Rosai-Dorfman disease.
