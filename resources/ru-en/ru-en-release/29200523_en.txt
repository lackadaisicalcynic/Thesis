Systematic review of dietary trans-fat reduction interventions.
Objective  To systematically review published studies of interventions to reduce people's intake of dietary trans-fatty acids (TFAs).
Methods
We searched online databases (CINAHL, the CRD Wider Public Health database, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Ovid®, MEDLINE®, Science Citation Index and Scopus) for studies evaluating TFA interventions between 1986 and 2017.
Absolute decrease in TFA consumption (g/day) was the main outcome measure.
We excluded studies reporting only on the TFA content in food products without a link to intake.
We included trials, observational studies, meta-analyses and modelling studies.
We conducted a narrative synthesis to interpret the data, grouping studies on a continuum ranging from interventions targeting individuals to population-wide, structural changes.
Results
After screening 1084 candidate papers, we included 23 papers: 12 empirical and 11 modelling studies.
Multiple interventions in Denmark achieved a reduction in TFA consumption from 4.5 g/day in 1976 to 1.5 g/day in 1995 and then virtual elimination after legislation banning TFAs in manufactured food in 2004.  Elsewhere, regulations mandating reformulation of food reduced TFA content by about 2.4 g/day.
Worksite interventions achieved reductions averaging 1.2 g/day.  Food labelling and individual dietary counselling both showed reductions of around 0.8 g/day.
Conclusion  Multicomponent interventions including legislation to eliminate TFAs from food products were the most effective strategy.
Reformulation of food products and other multicomponent interventions also achieved useful reductions in TFA intake.  By contrast, interventions targeted at individuals consistently achieved smaller reductions.
Future prevention strategies should consider this effectiveness hierarchy to achieve the largest reductions in TFA consumption.
