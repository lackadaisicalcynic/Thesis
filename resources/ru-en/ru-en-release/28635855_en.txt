[Diabetes mellitus and the central nervous system].  The review considers the current views on the central nervous system (CNS) in diabetes mellitus (DM).
It discusses an attitude towards the term 'diabetic encephalopathy'.
The data of investigations of cognitive functions in types 1 and 2 DM and the brain structural imaging results obtained using up-to-date technologies are considered.
The results of studies of the factors that induce cerebral changes in DM and their associated cognitive impairments are given.
There is evidence that hyperglycemia has a more considerable impact on the above processes than hypoglycemia; other possible factors, apart from blood glucose control, are set out.
The current views on the function of insulin in the CNS and the relationship of central insulin resistance to Alzheimer's disease are outlined.  There are current data on intranasal insulin application that is still exploratory, but, as might be judged from the findings, may by a promising method for the treatment and prevention of cognitive decline in both patients with DM and those without this condition.
