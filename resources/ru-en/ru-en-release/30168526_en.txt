[The forensic medical estimation of the biological age of the corpse based on the morphological changes in the skin].  The objective of the present work was the immunohistochemical evaluation of the age-related dynamics of apoptosis-associated proteins contained in the human skin epidermis.
We studied the samples of skin tissues obtained during the forensic medical expertises of 100 corpses of the subjects who died in the consequence of acute blood loss in the absence of injuries or pathological changes in the skin (56 men and 44 women at the age varying from 5 to 85 years).
The results of this study give evidence that the histoimmunological investigations of the skin tissues can be carried out with the use of the mmunohistochemical Ki67, bcl-2, and p53 markers for the more accurate determination of the biological age of the deceased subjects.
The quantitative characteristics thus obtained serve as reliable indicators of the chronic changes in the skin and can be used as the components of the combined diagnostic procedures.
