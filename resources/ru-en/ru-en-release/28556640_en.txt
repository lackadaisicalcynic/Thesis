["Protein of senility" CCL11, "protein of juvenility" GDF11 and their role in age-related pathology].  The paper presents the latest literature data on the structure and functions of «protein of juvenility» - CCL11 and «protein of senility» - GDF11.
Chemokine CCL11 injected to young animals has been shown to lead to degenerative changes in the central nervous system (CNS), disturb cognitive functions and impede tissue regeneration.
CCL11 concentration increases dramatically in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, neuro-inflammatory disorders, cerebral malaria, drug addiction, as well as in atherosclerosis, periodontal disease, macular degeneration, cancer and other pathologies.
In contrast to CCL11, differentiation growth factor 11 (GDF11), being administered to old mice, eliminates age-associated hypertrophy of the heart, improves muscle tone and prevents degenerative changes in the CNS, improves cognitive functions and enhances tissue regeneration.
Its concentration decreases in cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and other «diseases of old age».
At the same time, the higher the GDF11 level in the blood, the milder myocardial infarction, stroke and other age-related diseases of the cardiovascular system.
