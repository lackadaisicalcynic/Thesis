[Evaluation of the biological behavior of ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors using various methods].  This literature review is aimed at studying markers obtained by various research methods to assess the biological behavior of ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors.
This paper presents the clinical, laboratory, instrumental. histological, and immunohistochemical aspects of ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors.
Histological method allows assessing the structures of a tumor and differential diagnosis of other pathological process in the sella turcica.
Immunohistochemical method enables determining the expression of multiple markers (fibroblast growth factors, matrix metalloproteinases, apoptotic factors, pituitary tumor transforming gene, and vascular markers), which reflect various processes of oncogenesis of studied tumors, and according to the authors, are promising with regard to predicting biological behavior using corticotropin.
Epigenetic investigations including the study of micro-RNA expression, proteomics, and transcriptomics are the new methods in this area, which are expected to provide additional details regarding the prediction using corticotropin.  Thus, the cumulative assessment using laboratory and instrumental methods, the study of immunoexpression of malignant potential markers in the tissue using corticotropin and micro-RNA allow predicting the future biological behavior of ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors.
