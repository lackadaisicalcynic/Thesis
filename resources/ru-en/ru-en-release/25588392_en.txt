[Comparative analysis of the various instrumental diagnostics methods to the assessment of tooth supporting structure].
The tooth resonance frequency method for periodontal condition diagnostics was compared with apparatus measurement of the tooth mobility in vivo.
Tooth natural frequency and tooth mobility were correlated with clinical condition of tooth supporting structure.  According to the condition of tooth supporting structure stability zones were indentified.
The squared dependence between tooth natural frequency and the value of tooth mobility was revealed.
The resonance frequency method is more exact for clinical assessment of periodontal tissues in comparison with instrumental measurement of the tooth mobility.
