[Oxidative DNA damage in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in older patients].
Oxidative stress has long been recognized to play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and aging, initiating oxidative damage of biomolecules.  In this study the development of imbalances in the system of lipid peroxidation and increase the level of the marker of oxidative damage to DNA - 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-ОНdG) in patients with COPD and healthy individuals.
Evaluation of the relationship between the parameters of the system of lipid peroxidation and the level of 8-ОНdG allowed to drill down to different oxidative mechanisms in the pathogenesis of COPD in patients of middle or old age.
