[Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease: histological, immunohistochemical, and interferometric examinations].
OBJECTIVE
To quantify the morphochemical characteristics of Lewy bodies detected in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The investigators studied the localization of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) and the distribution of neurofilament protein and synaptophysin by immunohistochemical assas and compared with the results of interferometry and computer-assisted morphometry of Lewy bodies in the autopsy specimens of the substantia nigra from PD patients.  RESULTS
Three groups of synuclein-positive aggregates differing in shape were identified.  Mature Lewy bodies had a rounded shape, a concentric structure, a poorly stained core, and, as compared with neuropil, a high phase difference value.
Comparison of the localization of α-Syn, neurofilaments, and synaptophysin showed that immunostaining of neurofilaments in the peripheral layer of Lewy bodies was shifted closer to the nucleus and the localization of synaptophysin and α-Syn coincided.  CONCLUSION
Synuclein-positive protein aggregates showed heterogeneity in structure, shape, and protein composition in PD.  The localization of neurofilament protein and synaptophysin in Lewy bodies attests that the cytoskeleton and neuronal synaptic vesicle trafficking in the substantia nigra are impaired in BP.
