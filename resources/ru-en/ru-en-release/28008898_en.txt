[Argon-laser ablation is a new method of airways recanalization for tumoral stenosis].  AIM
To develop the new method of laser recanalization of airways for tumoral stenosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  It is proposed to conduct laser effect in the gas environment that does not support combustion (argon).
Also the device for these AIM: is suggested.
The method is called argon-laser ablation (ALA).  A comparison of ALA and conventional high-energy laser exposure (LPD) was performed.
RESULTS
ALA and LPD were used in 46 patients and 17 patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
The duration of endobronchial operations and incidence of complications were significantly higher in group 2.  The incidence of complete remission was significantly higher in group 1.
CONCLUSION
Endobronchial argon-laser ablation of tracheal and bronchial tumors removes exophytic tumoral component in more favorable conditions compared with conventional high-energy laser exposure.  Also it significantly increases an efficiency and reduces the frequency of complications.
