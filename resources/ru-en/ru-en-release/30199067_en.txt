[A regularity changes occlusal plane inclination in the case of treatment of distocclusion by fixed individual lingual appliance].
The use of the lingual individual orthodontic appliance is accompanied by prematurity contact of the front teeth, which affects the rotation of the occlusal plane, especially in cases with distocclusion and deep overbite.  The study of regularities of changes in the inclination of the occlusal plane is an important diagnostic feature, contributes to treatment planning and obtaining sustainable results.
AIM
To assess the direction of rotation and the degree of change in inclination of the occlusal plane in cases with distocclusion.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 56 patients, of which 44 were female and 12 were male, with distal occlusion of the dentition and deep overbite.  We studied the position of the occlusal plane, relative to the geometric center of the Ramus - point Xi in two groups of patients: 50% with occlusal Biteplanes and 50% without occlusal Biteplanes in the upper canine's brackets.
RESULTS
In both groups, the position of the occlusal plane, relative to the point Xi, has improved: in the first - by 1.2 mm, the second - by 2.4 mm.
CONCLUSION
The comparison of the dataset shows automatical improving of position of the occlusal plane in both groups.
The most pronounced changes, detected in the treatment with lingual braces, shows Biteplane group.
