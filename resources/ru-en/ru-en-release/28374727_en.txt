AIM  The objective of the present study was to elaborate the method for the evaluation of the fine motor activity of the wrist in the patients presenting with wrist movement disorders resulting from central hemiparesis and to demonstratee the reliability of such method through the calculation of the standard error of measurements and minimal the detectable change (MDC95%).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study population was comprised of 42 patients who had undergone ischaemic stroke and suffered from the impairment of the upper limb functions .  The deficit of the fine motor skills was estimated with the use of the original multi-touch diagnostic technique.  The results of the assessment were compared with those of the measurement of upper limb motor activity based on the validated scales, such as the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) scale and the Nine Hole Peg Test (PHT).
RESULTS
The study with the application of the multi-touch method for diagnostics of the fine motor skills has demonstrated the high internal consistency of the measurements, with the Cronbach's Alpha Reliability Coefficient amounting to 0.98.  The re-test reliability was high, with the ICC=0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99).
The Spearman rank-order correlation with the locomotion scale estimates gave evidence of the good associative links, with the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale correlation coefficient making 0.55-0.66 and the Nine Hole Peg Test findings being -0.7.
The Minimal Detectable Change (MDC95%) for the multi-touch method was found to be 12.67%.
CONCLUSION
The objective diagnostics of the fine motor skill disturbances with the use of the original multi-touch method has demonstrated its high reliability and a high degree of correlation with the estimates obtained with the application of the modern validated scales in the patients who had undergone ischaemic stroke.  Therefore, this method can be recommended for clinical use.
