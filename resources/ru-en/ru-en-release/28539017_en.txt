[Comparative analysis of different methods of geroprotective].  In the monitoring process 110 representatives of different age groups held a comparative analysis of the efficacy and safety of several geroprotective techniques, including the use of dry carbon dioxide baths, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, therapeutic massage and receiving Oligopeptide preparations containing complexes lysyl-glutamyl-asparagin and glutamyl-asparagin-arginine (Vezugen and Pinealon).
The most pronounced positive impact on indicators of biological age were detected during the combined use of these two Oligopeptide complexes.
The most safe from the point of view of influence on a number of biochemical, immunological parameters, clinical condition of the patients were therapeutic massage and Oligopeptide drugs.
The use of dry carbon dioxide baths and hyperbaric oxygenation with an undoubtedly positive influence on the indices of biological age has a number of limitations and contraindications regarding its security.
