[Global action for hearing loss].  Over 6% of the world's population lives with disabling hearing loss which can adversely affect their development, education and overall health.
Unless action is taken, it is expected that by 2050 the prevalence of hearing loss could grow to nearly 10%.
Many of the causes responsible for this growth, such as noise, ototoxicity and ear infections are preventable through public health measures.  In those who develop hearing loss: appropriate, timely and cost effective interventions can reduce its adverse impact.
However, most people do not have access to the required ear and hearing care services.  Strong government-led action, is required to address this issue.
Such action must focus on raising awareness in all sections of society and providing services to address hearing loss.
Professional groups and civil society has to support governments in developing and implementing evidence-based policies that can ensure accessible ear and hearing care for all.
