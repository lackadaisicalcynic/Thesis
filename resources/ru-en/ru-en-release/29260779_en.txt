[The relationship between the parameters of evoked otoacoustical emission and tympanometry in the children born with the extremely low body weight].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate correlation between the parameters of evoked otoacoustical emission at the distorsion product otoacoustic emissionen frequency (DPOAE) and the results of tympoanometry performed at the probe tone frequencies of 226 Hz and 1 kHz in the children born with the extremely low body weight.
The results of the study give evidence of the moderate correlation dependence between the strength of the cochlear acoustic response at DPOAE and the cohlear response amplitude at the frequencies of 2 kHz and 6 kHz from TTP (r=0.3; p=0.000) obtained at the tympanometry probe tone frequency of 1 kHz.
The correlation between the magnitude of the acoustic response of the cochlea, the amplitude of this response at the frequencies of 2 kHz and 6 kHz, the width of the tympanograms, and their static compliance obtained in the studies at the tympanometry probe tone frequency of 1,000 Hz (r=0.3-0.5; p=0.001) was documented in the infants at the age of 6 months and 1 year.
