[Synthetic osteoplastic materials for alveolar bone augmentation before dental implantation].  The study presents scientific data about surgical preparation of the alveolar bone before dental implantation by applying synthetic osteoplastic materials.
The review analyzed the results of experimental and clinical studies on structural features and the efficiency of these materials, the time for replacement of new-formed bone tissue and contains comparative analysis of the efficiency of synthetic bone substitutes and other types of osteoplastic materials.
