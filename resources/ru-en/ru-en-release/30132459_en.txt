[Cluster analysis of inflammatory markers in disorders of adaptation].
AIM
To determine immunophenotypes of patients with adaptation disorders using cluster analysis.  The level of inflammatory markers such as leukocyte elastase (LE) enzyme activity and functional activity of α1-protease inhibitor (α1-PI) were used as a classifying attribute (characteristic).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The results of evaluation of enzymatic activity of LE and functional activity of α1-PI in 40 patients with adaptation disorders (ICD-10 F43.2) were subjected to cluster analysis.
The control group included 23 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.  RESULTS
Several algorithms of cluster analysis allow to identify three immunophenotypes in the group of patients with adaptation disorders.  Immunophenotypes differed significantly by ratios of LE and α1-PI activity, which were mostly driven by different LE activity.
Cluster 1 with the relatively low LE activity and high background α1-PI, is of particular interest because it may reflect the disturbed interaction between the various links of immune response.  CONCLUSION
The obtained results of cluster analysis confirm the hypothesis about the existence of three immunophenotypes in the patients with adaptation disorders, which indicates that a phenotypically similar pattern can be determined by different spectra of immune indices.
