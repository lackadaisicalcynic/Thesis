[Mental health disorders in the first years of life: autism spectrum disorders, constitutional and residual-organic abnormalities].
In the first part of a literature review, new approaches to multidisciplinary diagnoses of mental health disorders in early childhood are considered.  The opportunities for standardization of clinical, psychological and social indicators on the basis of international Diagnostic classification of mental health and developmental disorders of infancy and early childhood (DC:0-3R) are emphasized.
The main assessment of diagnostic techniques of this psycho-pathological class in the first years of life are considered.
An analysis of current data on autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and data about different variants of ASD course are presented.
The analysis of current publications in the field of early constitutional and residual-organic abnormalities showed the congruence between them and 'regulation disorders of sensory processing', described in DC:0-3R.
