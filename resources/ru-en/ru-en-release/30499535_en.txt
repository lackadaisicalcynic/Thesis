[Ultrasound biomicroscopy for examination of the anterior segment of the eye in patients with intumescent cataract].  According to a prospective review study by H. Gimbel, A. Willerscheidt (1993), among 2967 cataract cases analyzed in 1991, mature intumescent cataract was observed in 34 (1.15%) patients.
PURPOSE  To determine the parameters of the ocular anterior segment in patients with intumescent cataract and in their fellow eyes using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) for identification of differential characteristics of intumescent cataract.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of preoperative diagnostic examination of the anterior segment of the eye with UBM of 21 patients (21 eyes) with intumescent cataract and their 21 fellow eyes (42 eyes in total) were analyzed.
RESULTS
The mean anterior chamber depth according to UBM was 1.96±0.108 mm (from corneal endothelium), in the fellow eyes - 2.74±0.11 mm.
The anterior chamber angle was 11.54±2.19°, in the fellow eyes - 20.63±4.08°.
The lens thickness in the eyes with intumescent cataract was 5.26±0.13 mm, in the fellow eyes - 4.34±0.09 mm.
The length of Zinn ligaments in the external, interior and superior ocular segments of the main group eyes were equal, in the inferior segments they were longer by 0.1 mm.
The difference in Zinn ligament length in the eyes with intumescent cataract and fellow eyes was approximately 0.1-0.15 mm in all segments.
The equatorial angle in the eyes with intumescent cataract was 32.52±0.92°, in the fellow eyes - 14.85±1.09°.
CONCLUSION
A differential symptom of intumescent cataract was identified - complete spherophakia, as confirmed by a specific UBM sign: increase of the equatorial angle by 17° in comparison with the fellow eye, while the length of Zinn ligament remains equal in all segments.
