[On the necessity of the development of modern algorithms for the evaluation of the injuries inflicted with scissors].  At present, a steady growth in the frequency of wounds inflicted by sharp injurious objects (e.g. scissors) is being observed.
It necessitates an enhanced attention to the investigation of the causes underlying such events and the circumstances accompanying them.  This article presents an example of one of the injuries inflicted with scissors that required the most careful and comprehensive criminalistic study despite the seemingly self-evident circumstances of the event.
This case illustrates the necessity of development of the modern algorithms for the evaluation of the injuries inflicted with the scissors.
