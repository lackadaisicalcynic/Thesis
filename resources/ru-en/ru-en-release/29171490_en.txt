[Genetic and clinical predictors of treatment efficacy in depressive disorders].
AIM
To study clinical and genetic characteristics that impact on the efficacy of pharmacotherapy of depressive disorders.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 188 patients with unipolar depressive disorders of different genesis (psychogenic, endogenous and organic).
A clinical-psychopathological method and depression psychometric scales were used.  Serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR and STin2 and dopamine transporter 3',-VNTR polymorphisms were determined.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The S-allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is associated with the low efficacy of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
Tricyclic antidepressants are more effective in treatment of psychogenic depression.
The authors determined clinical factors that can predict response to treatment of psychogenic and endogenous depression.
No predictors were found for organic depression.
