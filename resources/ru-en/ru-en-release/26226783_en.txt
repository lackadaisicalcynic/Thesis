[Role of cadherins in health and in developing breast cancer].  The review gives data on the structure of cadherin cell adhesion molecules, their role in the body's development and malignant tumor progression.
It describes cadherins that are considered to play the most important role in the development of a tumor process: E-, P-, and N-cadherins that belong to type I classical cadhedrins and VE-cadhedrin that does to type II cadherins.
Particular emphasis is placed on the signal mechanisms with involvement of cadherins and cadherin-related molecules, which are realized in the body in health and in tumor transformation of cells.
