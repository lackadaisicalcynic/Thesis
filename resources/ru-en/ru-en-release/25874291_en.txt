[Modern molecular approaches to diagnosis and treatment of high-grade brain gliomas].
The review analyzes the current state of the problem of diagnosis and therapy of high-grade gliomas on the basis of the most promising present-day approaches.  The diagnostic and treatment perspectives of the molecular genetic analysis of glioblastoma markers located on the tumor cell surface are considered.
Gene therapy and the use of dendritic cells and oncolytic viruses are considered as the most interesting approaches to therapy of high-grade gliomas.
