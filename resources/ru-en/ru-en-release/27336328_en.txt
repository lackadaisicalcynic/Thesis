[Quality of life of patients with venous thromboses in different variants of anticoagulant therapy].
The CIVIQ questionnaire was used to evaluate quality of life of patients presenting with deep vein thrombosis of lower limbs in different variants of anticoagulant therapy.
The study included a total of 170 patients who were depending on the variant of anticoagulant therapy subdivided into 3 groups: Group One (comprising 48 patients) taking rivaroxaban as monotherapy; Group Two (consisting of 73 subjects) receiving low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin sodium) followed by adjusting the warfarin dose, and Group Three (including 49 patients) receiving low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin sodium) followed by rivaroxaban.  The total value of the level of quality of life in all groups showed a tendency towards restoration.
However, patients taking warfarin during the follow-up period were found to have negative dynamics by the 6th month of treatment.
It was revealed that quality of life on all parameters was higher in patients taking rivaroxaban and lower in those taking warfarin.  The parameters of the physical component of health turned out to depend upon the degree of recanalization of the thrombus.
After 6 months of anticoagulant therapy patients taking rivaroxaban (Groups One and Three) were found to have good recanalization in 87.5 and 87.7% of cases, respectively, while in Group Two being observed in 54.8% of patients only.  Taking an anticoagulant at a fixed dose not requiring laboratory control (rivaroxaban) increases patient compliance, thus leading to improvement of both mental and social wellbeing.
