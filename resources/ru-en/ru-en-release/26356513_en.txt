[Statokinetic characteristics of vestibular dysfunction in patients with vascular compression of the cochleo-vestibular nerve].  AIM
To study the state of statokinetic stability in patients with recurrent vestibular dysfunction caused by the vascular compression of the cochlea-vestibular nerve.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 30 patients with recurrent vestibular dysfunction in which neuroimaging studies revealed the vessel adjacent to the cochlea-vestibular nerve.
Statokinetic stability evaluation was selected as a neurophysiological indicator of the cochlea-vestibular nerve hyperactivity syndrome.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The correlation of the statokinetic stability indicators with the functional tests used and the side of the vascular compression of the cochlea-vestibular nerve has demonstrated high sensitivity of the statokinetic function to the turning of the head to the side of the neurovascular interaction with the decrease in stability in 17 (77.3%), as well as the minor in 15 (68.2%) and marked in 7 (31,8%) cases worsening of the statokinetic function during optokinetic stimulation (p<0.05).
High diagnostic value of computer stabilometry with biological feedback in the objectification of the vestibulovegetative syndrome and detection of latent vestibular dysfunction in the patients with proven vascular compression of the cochlea-vestibular nerve has been shown.
