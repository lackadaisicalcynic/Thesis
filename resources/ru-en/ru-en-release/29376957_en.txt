['Conservative' organ-sparing approach for ovarian torsion in children].
AIM
To improve the outcomes in children with ovarian torsion.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Three clinical observations of patients with ovarian torsion are presented.
Duration of the disease was 3-4 days.  All children underwent organ-sparing surgery including untwisting followed by ovariopexy.
RESULTS
All children were examined in early and late postoperative period (up to 5 years) after organ-sparing procedures.
Ultrasonic picture of the ovaries including structure and dimensions corresponded to age, the follicles were determined.
CONCLUSION
'Conservative' approach allows to preserve anatomical structure and potential for reproductive function.
