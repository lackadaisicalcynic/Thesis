[Myocardial fibrosis: Current aspects of the problem].
Fibrosis is one of the main components in the progression of most cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease, by causing structural changes in the myocardium and vascular wall.  The quantitative and qualitative characteristics of fibrosis of the myocardium are responsible for decreasing its elastic properties, developing diastolic dysfunction, impairing myocardial contractility, developing systolic dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias, and worsening coronary blood flow in patients with heart failure of different etiologies.
The important aspect of studying fibrosis is not only its interpretation as a model of the typical pathological process, but also its consideration as a systemic lesion of various organs and tissues.  At the same time, the identification of myocardial fibrosis biomarkers that are available for their determination in circulating blood is of particular interest.
Since there was evidence for the role of fibrosis in developing dysfunction of various organs and ensuring the systematicity of most diseases, especially at their development stages, the process of fibrosis came to be regarded as a promising therapeutic target.  It is relevant to further investigate myocardial fibrosis, which is aimed at increasing the efficiency of its diagnosis and predicting its course and pathogenetically sound therapy.
