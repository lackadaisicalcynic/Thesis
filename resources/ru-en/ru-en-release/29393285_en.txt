[Transient enlargement of craniopharyngioma cysts after stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery].  Stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery (RT/ES) is an effective technique for treating craniopharyngiomas (CPs).
However, enlargement of the cystic part of the tumor occurs in some cases after irradiation.  The enlargement may be transient and not require treatment or be a true relapse requiring treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of 79 pediatric patients who underwent stereotactic RT or RS after resection of craniopharyngioma.
RESULTS
Five-year relapse-free survival after complex treatment of CP was 86%.
In the early period after irradiation, 3.5 months (2.7-9.4) on average, enlargement of the cystic component of the tumor was detected in 10 (12.7%) patients; in 9 (11.4%) of them, the enlargement was transient and did not require treatment; in one case, the patient underwent surgery due to reduced visual acuity.
In 8 (10.1%) patients, an increase in the residual tumor (a solid component of the tumor in 2 cases and a cystic component of the tumor in 6 cases) occurred in the long-term period after irradiation - after 26.3 months (16.6-48.9) and did not decrease during follow-up in none of the cases, i.e. continued growth of the tumor was diagnosed.
A statistical analysis revealed that differences in the terms of transient enlargement and true continued growth were statistically significant (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION
Enlargement of a craniopharyngioma cyst in the early period (up to 1 year) after RT/RS is usually transient and does not require surgical treatment (except cases where worsening of neurological symptoms occurs, or occlusive hydrocephalus develops).
