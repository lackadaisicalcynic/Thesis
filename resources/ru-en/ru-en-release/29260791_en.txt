[The clinical classification of acute otitis media with special reference to tympanometry].  We have developed a new clinical classification of acute otitis media (AOM) based on the previously proposed classifications of V.T. Palchun with co-workers (1997) and J. Jeger (1970) in which the letter near the stage of the pathological process roughly corresponds to the type of the tympanogram as follows: stage I (acute tubootitis): A, B, C; stage II (acute catarrhal otitis media): A, B, C; stage III (acute purulent otitis media, perforation stage); stage IV (acute purulent otitis media, post-perforation stage); stage V (resolution of otitis media): A - convalescence or recovery, B1 - exudate present in the tympanic cavity; B2 - persisting perforation; C - block of the auditory tube, O - the development of complications.  This classification implies the necessity of tympanometry at the stage of diagnostics of AOM although it is not mandatory because the detection of exudate as a result of paracentesis at any of the stages of otitis media will allow to designate the stage of otitis either by letter A, B or C.
The application of the new classification described in this article permits to more accurately than before determine the character of the pathological process in the middle ear during the course of acute otitis media which is of special importance in the clinical pediatric practice for the timely and adequate treatment of the children.
