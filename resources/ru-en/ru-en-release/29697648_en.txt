[The interdisciplinary approach to the rehabilitation of the patients presenting with congenital atresia of the external auditory canal and the concomitant microtia].  The objective of the present study was to develop and introduce into the clinical practice the method for the combined aesthetic and functional rehabilitation of the patients presenting with congenital atresia of the external auditory canal (CAEAC) and the concomitant microtia.
A total of 8 patients at the age from 6 to 21 years with unilateral CAEAC and microtia were given the surgical treatment.  During the intervention, atresia was resolved using the trans-mastoid approach, tympanoplasty of autofasciae and ossiculoplasty making use of the partial titanium prosthesis and the placement of cranial osteointegratable titanium implants.
At the second stage of the surgical intervention the 3D silicone prosthesis of the auricle shaped on an individual basis were used.
The long-term follow-up observations have demonstrated the stable formation of the tube of the external auditory canal, with the bone-air interval amounting to 15-20 dB.  The auricular prosthesis was the mirror image of the natural ear and completely concealed the congenital defect.
