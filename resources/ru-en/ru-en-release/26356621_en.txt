[Intravenous immunoglobulin in treatment of autoimmune neurological diseases in children].  Though the mechanisms of action of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are not completely understood, these drugs are widely used in treatment of autoimmune diseases.
In this review, we have analyzed the literature on the use of IVIG in the treatment of autoimmune diseases of the nervous system in children and discuss the management of patients basing on the recommendation of the European Federation of Neurological Societies.  The efficacy of IVIG in children has been shown as first line treatment in Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, dermatomyositis as a second-line drug in the combination with prednisolone or immunosuppressors in patients refractory to treatment with corticosteroids and cytostatics, myasthenic crisis in myasthenia gravis, exacerbations and short-term treatment of severe forms, non-responsiveness to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, multiple sclerosis as second or third line of treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting course with intolerance to standard immunomodulatory therapy, acute multiple encephalomyelitis with no response to the treatment with high doses of corticosteroids, paraneoplastic syndromes, pharmacoresistant epilepsy and autoimmune encephalitis.
Because the right choice of the drug plays a key role, in particular, in children, that determines the efficacy and safety of the treatment, we present the main approaches to the choice of the drug and schemes of treatment of autoimmune diseases of the nervous system in children.
