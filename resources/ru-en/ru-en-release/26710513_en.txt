[Evaluation of the conservability of zolpidem and zaleplon in the hepatic tissue].  This paper reports the experimental data on the conservability of zolpidem and zalepion in the samples of the cadaveric liver tissue stored under different conditions.
The authors describe the method that includes isolation of the substances of interest from the hepatic tissue by means of acetone extraction, their solvent and chromatographic purification, and subsequent identification with the help of the spectrophotometric technique.
It is shown that zolpidem and zaleplon remain in the cadaveric hepatic tissue within 6 months after intoxication regardless of temperature which makes possible their detection, isolation, and identification by the proposed method.
