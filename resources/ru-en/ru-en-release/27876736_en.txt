[The speech audiometry using the matrix sentence test].  The matrix sentence test in which the five-word semantically unpredictable sentences presented under the background noise conditions are used as the speech material was designed and validated for many languages.
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the Russian version of the matrix sentence test (RuMatrix test) in the listeners of different ages with normal hearing.
At the first stage of the study, 35 listeners at the age from 18 to 33 year were examined.
The results of the estimation of the training effect dictated the necessity of conducting two training tracks before carrying out the RuMatrix test proper.
The signal-to-noise ratio at which 50% speech recognition (SRT50) was obtained was found to be -8.8±0.8 dB SNR.
A significant effect of exposure to the background noise was demonstrated: the noise level of 80 and 75 Db SPL led to a considerably lower intelligibility than the noise levels in the range from 45 to 70 dB SPL; in the subsequent studies, the noise level of 65 dB SPL was used.
The high test-retest reliability of the RuMatrix test was proved.
At the second stage of the study, 20 young (20-40 year old) listeners and 20 aged (62-74 year old) ones were examined.
The mean SRT50 in the aged patients was found to be -6.9±1.1 dB SNR which was much worse than the mean STR50 in the young subjects (-8.7±0.9 dB SNR).
It is concluded that, bearing in mind the excellent comparability of the results of the RUMat rix test across different languages, it can be used as a universal tool in international research projects.
