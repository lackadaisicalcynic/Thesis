[Influence of TGF-Î² cytokine and a number of other biochemical factors on regenerative process].
Scarring is one of the main causes of surgical failure in a number of eye diseases, dacryologic conditions in particular.
The process of wound healing, including postoperative wound healing, goes through several stages mediated by various biochemical factors, such as growth factors and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.  The balance between the latter directly influences the wound healing.
However, current data on the effect of these factors on postoperative outcomes are few and contradictory.  Thus, in dacryology as well as in other areas of ophthalmology, the role of cytokines and growth factors in healing of surgical wounds is being intensively researched.
