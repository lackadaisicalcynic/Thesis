[Minimal-change glomerulonephritis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: A clinical case].  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in association with glomerulonephritis (GN) and renal failure is a serious problem in terms of therapy.
The paper reports a clinical case of a 64-year-old female patient with Binet stage C CLL accompanied by minimal-change GN complicated by nephrotic syndrome and the development of acute renal failure.
GN was diagnosed on the basis of electron microscopic studies of renal biopsy specimens.
It was treated with rituximab in combination with bendamustine.
The former was intravenously injected in a dose of 375 mg/m2 on day 0 of the cycle; the latter was given in a dose of 70 mg/m2 within the first 2 days; the cycle was repeated 28 days after initiation of the previous cycle.
Five cycles could result in complete CLL remission (the follow-up duration was 20 months); nephrotic syndrome was completely abolished and kidney function recovered.
