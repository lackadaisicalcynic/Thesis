[The detection and identification of alpha-pyrrolidino-valerophenone (α-PVP) and its metabolites in the objects of the forensic chemical examination].  The combined application of the IK 200609 chemical toxicological analyzer and the diagnostic biosensor (reagent) for the determination of synthetic cations (with due regard for compliance with the instruction for analysis) made it possible to detect during 15 minutes the presence of cations in the urine samples at the concentration of 376.64 ng/ml.
This result was further confirmed by HPLC-Ms/MS and GH-MS.  The use of the analyzer allowed the screening of the urine samples to be performed within several minutes at the preliminary stage of the study.
A simplified method of tissue sample preparation with the use of the kits for extraction and solid-phase purification is proposed together with a variant of blood sample preparation with the use of filtration.
The proposed approach can be employed for the rapid detection and identification of alpha-pyrrolidino-valerophenone (α-PVP) and its metabolites in urine, blood and tissues of various organs for the purpose of practical toxicological investigations in the framework of forensic chemical expertise.
