[The association between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene and the efficacy and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors].
OBJECTIVE
To search for the association between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene and the efficacy and tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The complex clinical/psychopathological and genetic study of 38 patients with depression treated with SSRIs was carried out.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was associated with the rate of achievement of remission and tolerability of treatment: carriers of the SS genotype achieved remission less frequently and more frequently experienced side-effects.
