Antibiotic distribution channels in Thailand: results of key-informant interviews, reviews of drug regulations and database searches.
Objective
To analyse how antibiotics are imported, manufactured, distributed and regulated in Thailand.
Methods
We gathered information, on antibiotic distribution in Thailand, in in-depth interviews - with 43 key informants from farms, health facilities, pharmaceutical and animal feed industries, private pharmacies and regulators- and in database and literature searches.  Findings
In 2016-2017, licensed antibiotic distribution in Thailand involves over 700 importers and about 24 000 distributors - e.g. retail pharmacies and wholesalers.
Thailand imports antibiotics and active pharmaceutical ingredients.  There is no system for monitoring the distribution of active ingredients, some of which are used directly on farms, without being processed.
Most antibiotics can be bought from pharmacies, for home or farm use, without a prescription.
Although the 1987 Drug Act classified most antibiotics as "dangerous drugs", it only classified a few of them as prescription-only medicines and placed no restrictions on the quantities of antibiotics that could be sold to any individual.
Pharmacists working in pharmacies are covered by some of the Act's regulations, but the quality of their dispensing and prescribing appears to be largely reliant on their competences.  Conclusion
In Thailand, most antibiotics are easily and widely available from retail pharmacies, without a prescription.  If the inappropriate use of active pharmaceutical ingredients and antibiotics is to be reduced, we need to reclassify and restrict access to certain antibiotics and to develop systems to audit the dispensing of antibiotics in the retail sector and track the movements of active ingredients.
