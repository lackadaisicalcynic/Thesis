[Clinical features and diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy].
Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is a serious complication of diabetes that leads to early disability in patients if late diagnosed.  There has been a lot of research into pathophysiological mechanisms of nerve fiber damage and risk factors for neurological complications of diabetes.
Early diagnosis of the latter is quite a challenge and, thus, the problem of finding more reliable diagnostic modalities is rather pressing.  In this review, an interdisciplinary approach to the said problem, high-end diagnostic methods, and clinical features of DPN are described.
