[Protein-losing enteropathy].  Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is a rare complication of intestinal diseases.
Its main manifestation is hypoproteinemic edema.
The diagnosis of PLE is based on the verification of protein loss into the intestinal lumen, by determining fecal Î±1-antitrypsin concentration and clearance.
The localization of the affected colonic segment is clarified using radiologic and endoscopic techniques.
The mainstay of treatment for PLE is a fat-free diet enriched with medium-chain triglycerides.
Surgical resection of the affected segment of the colon may be the treatment of choice for severe hypoproteinemia resistant to drug therapy.
