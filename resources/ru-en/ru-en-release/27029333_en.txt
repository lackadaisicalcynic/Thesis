[Basal ganglia germinomas in children.  Four clinical cases and a literature review].
Basal ganglia germinomas are a specific group of intracranial germinomas.  Their early diagnosis is complicated due to their atypical localization and diversity of neuroimaging and clinical signs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We describe 4 cases of basal ganglia germinoma in boys of 13, 14, 15, and 16 years of age.
The medical history data, clinical features, neuroimaging and histological characteristics of basal ganglia germonomas, and preliminary results of the treatment are presented.
CONCLUSION
Basal ganglia germinomas are usually verified at the late stage of the disease when patients are detected with extended lesions of the basal ganglia and severe neurological and neuroendocrine deficits.
This situation is due to clinical and imaging signs that are untypical of common germinomas.
