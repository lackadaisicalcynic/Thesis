[On the question of the organization of brain function: cortical associations, «disconnection» syndrome and higher brain functions].  The review considers the structural/functional brain organization, the disturbance of which is accompanied by the development of cognitive and behavioral disorders.
The significance of the disruption of parallel circuits connecting frontal lobes with subcortical structures (the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum) is highlighted.  This disruption is clinically described as "disconnection" syndrome.
The associations between the basal ganglia and the cortex of the large cerebral hemispheres responsible for motor, cognitive and emotional/behavioral functions do not restricted to these spheres and is characteristic not only of frontal brain areas.  There are circuits connecting other brain compartments and the basal ganglia that provide perception, and are involved in decision making on the basis of input information of different modalities.
The improvement of understanding of the pathophysiology and neurochemistry of these structures opens new possibilities for selective action on some or other circuit to achieve the best therapeutic result.
