[The influence of the climatic and weather conditions on the mechanisms underlying the formation of enhanced meteosensitivity (a literature review)].  The present review concerns the problem of the influence of the climatic conditions on the human body, the creation of the medical weather forecast service, the development of non-pharmacological methods for the correction of meteopathic disorders, and the reduction of the risk of the complications provoked by the unfavourable weather conditions.
The literature data are used to analyse the influence of climatic and weather factors on the formation of enhanced meteosensitivity and the development of exacerbations of chronic non-communicable diseases under the influence of weather conditions.  It is concluded that marked changes of the weather may lead to an increased frequency of exacerbations of the chronic non-communicable diseases.
The influence of weather and climate on human health is becoming an increasingly important factor under the current conditions bearing in mind the modern tendency toward variations of the global climatic conditions and their specific regional manifestations.
The authors emphasize the necessity of the identification and evaluation of the predictors of the development of high meteosensitivity for the prognostication of the risks of the meteopathic reactions and the complications associated with the changes in weather conditions as well as the importance of the improvement of the existing and the development of new methods for the non-pharmacological prevention and correction of enhanced meteosensitivity with the application of the natural and preformed physical factors.
