[Tonsillitis and tonsillogenic conditions].  The objective of the present study was to analyze and summarize the literature publications concerning tonsillitis and related (tonsillogenic) pathological conditions.
The retrospective analysis of these materials made it possible to collect and summarize information about the influence of palatine tonsillar pathology (chronic tonsillitis) on the function of various organs and their systems.
It has been shown that pathogenesis of a great variety of disease is underlain by pathology of palatine tonsils.
Also, the possibility to stabilize the pathological processes in certain organs and systems by the conservative and/or surgical treatment of chronic tonsillitis has been demonstrated.
It is concluded that the patients presenting with chronic tonsillitis make up a group of risk of development of many serious somatic diseases and require enhanced attention not only of otorhinolaryngologists but also specialists representing other medical disciplines.
The multidisciplinary approach to the management of such patients is the sole way to reduce the frequency ofgeneral complications in the patients with chronic tonsillitis.
