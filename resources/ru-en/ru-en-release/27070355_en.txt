[The role of the solar and geomagnetic activity in the etiology of multiple sclerosis: a review of the literature and prospects of research].
Despite the great progress in the study of multiple sclerosis (MS), its etiology remains unknown.  It is proved that MS occurs in genetically predisposed people under the influence of environmental factors.
Among these factors the solar activity (SA) and geomagnetic activity (GA) attract the particular attention.
This article presents the review of studies concerning the influence of SA and GA on the incidence and course of MS.
