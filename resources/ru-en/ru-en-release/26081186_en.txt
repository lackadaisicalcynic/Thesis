[Predictors of the results of kidney transplantation from living-related donors].
The aim of investigation is analysis of factors forecasting the results of kidney transplantation from living-related donors.
This research is based on the analysis of 272 kidneys' transplantation from living-related donors.  It was analyzed such parameters as recipients' age, donors' age, donors' sex, degree of relationship between donor and recipient, degree of HLA-compatibility, type of inductive immunosuppression (monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids, polyclonal antibodies), recipient's sex, presence or absence of rejection episodes for whole postoperative period.
We recognized that far not all above-mentioned parameters could predict the results of kidney transplantation from living-related donors.
