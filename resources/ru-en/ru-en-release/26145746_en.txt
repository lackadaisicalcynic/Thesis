[The experience with the use of the two-step laryngotracheoplasty for the management of subglottic and combined subglottic and upper tracheal cicatrical stenosis in the adult patients].
The objective of the present retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical experience with the use of the two-step laryngotracheoplasty for the treatment of subglottic and combined subglottic and upper tracheal cicatrical stenosis in the adult patients during the period between 2003 and 2012.
A total of 13 patients were retrospectively reviewed following the surgical treatment for the management of subglottic and combined subglottic and upper tracheal cicatrical stenosis based at the Lugansk regional clinical hospital.  The effectiveness of two-stage laryngotracheoplasty was estimated to be 84.6%.
The number of the surgical procedures per patient depended on the extent of tracheal stenosis while the overall rehabilitation period mainly depended on the severity of the concomitant pathologies.  The technical aspects and the results of the surgical treatment are discussed.
