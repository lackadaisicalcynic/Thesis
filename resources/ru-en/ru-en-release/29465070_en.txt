[Root canals dentinal wall structure after photodynamic exposure].
The aim of the study was to assess root canal dentinal walls structure after photodynamic exposure with the use of 0.5% photoditazine.
A root canal dentin of 46 single root intact teeth removed for orthodontic indications was examined by scanning electron microscope JEOL JSM-6510 (Japan).  Microphotographs of the root canal wall were obtained in the orifice, central and apical parts under×2000 magnification.
It was found that photoactivation of 0.5% gel photoditazine by a light source, laser or diode, with a wavelength of 635-660 nm and a power of 150-200 mW is an effective technique for removing the smear layer of the root canal wall, which facilitates the maximum opening of the dentinal tubules to a depth of 2-3 μm.
The best result (the maximum number of open dentinal tubules, the absence of a smear layer) is observed with 3 min photoditazine exposure and 2 min of laser exposure.
The method can be proposed as an alternative supplement to the conventional root canals irrigation.
