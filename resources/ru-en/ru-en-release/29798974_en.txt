[Intimal rupture of the displastic middle cerebral artery wall complicated by thrombosis and fatal ischemic stroke].  The authors present a clinical-morphological observation of the 47-year old man with a severe fatal ischemic stroke due to middle cerebral artery thrombosis which developed at the site of intimal rupture.
The cause of intimal rupture was the arterial wall dysplastic changes.
There were no signs of atherosclerosis and hypercoagulation.
As the intima rupture did not lead to blood input into arterial wall, but was accompanied by superimposed thrombosis, we suggested to denote such cases as incomplete dissection.
