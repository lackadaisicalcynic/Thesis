[Arterial ischemic stroke in children with mild head trauma].  AIM
To study the relationship between mild head trauma (MHT) and arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  We examined 81 patients with AIS, aged from 1 month to 15 years.
The sample was stratified into two groups: patients with AIS caused by MHT (main group) and patients without MHT (comparison group).  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Based on the results of clinical and instrumental studies, we identified the relationship between AIS and MHT.  The main group was characterized by the following features: moderate severity in the acute period, stabilization within 7 days, isolated subcortical localization of ischemic lesion, no MRI-signs of steno-occlusive cerebral arteriopathy and a trend towards the risk of recurrent strokes.
