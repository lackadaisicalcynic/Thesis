Technological features of metal-ceramic prosthesis frameworks manufactured from domestic alloys of precious and base metals.
The aim of the study was to examine changes in physical and mechanical properties of dental alloys depending of the initial composition at re-casting.  Russianc precious alloys: Plagodent (AuPtPd) and Palladent (PdAu) and base alloys: Vitiriy-N (NiCrMo) and Vitiriy-C (CoCrMo) were used as study samples, which were divided in three groups: a primary casting from the granules; 50% of re-casting; 100% of re-casting.
We investigated the yield strength in bending, coefficient of thermal expansion and hardness.
Changing in the composition of the alloys has led to changes of all physical and mechanical properties.
