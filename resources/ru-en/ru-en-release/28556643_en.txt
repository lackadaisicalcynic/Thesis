[Recent medical techniques for peripheral nerve repair: nerve guidance conduits update].  The review deals with recent medical methods of reconstruction of peripheral nerve injuries, especially using the technology of nerve guidance conduits (NGCs), as well as scientific and applied prospects of further development of clinical and technical research in this area.
In neurosurgery established techniques for the treatment of peripheral nerve injures include the matching and suturing of severed nerve fibers (however, it is important to avoid tension in gaps for effective regeneration of the nerve fiber), as well as allo/autologous nerve grafting for larger gaps (gold standard of repair).
Unfortunately, this treatment is not always feasible in a number of clinical situations, has drawbacks and is associated with a potential risk of postoperative complications; in particular applying of donor transplants is complicated immunological incompatibility reactions.
The use of implantable artificial tunneling device known as a nerve guidance conduit is an alternative method of reconstruction, contributing to the physiological regeneration of nerve fiber.
The article describes technical engineering constructions - including by using various non- and biomaterials, liquid metals, light/laser, methods of electrospinning and microstereolithography - which are either commercially available or pre-tested and clinical studies detailing outcomes and reconstructive options.
The review emphasizes that the further development of scientific research in the field of new materials and polymers, as well as techniques for the preparation and implantation of nerve conduits and their subsequent practical assessment is necessary for clinical medicine and rehabilitation.
