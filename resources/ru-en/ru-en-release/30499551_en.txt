[Macular pigments in retinal degenerative processes].  Macular pigments (MP) - carotenoids, which determine the structure of the central part of the retina, play an important role in the work of its foveolar part.
The main function of MP is to maintain full functionality of the macular area of the retina, which is based on the possibility of reducing color aberrations in the absorption of blue light and patients' ability for dark adaptation.
Epidemiological studies have revealed a direct correlation between the low MP and the increased risk of developing age-related macular degeneration.
However, global studies on the issue such as CARMA, CARMA, AREDS I, AREDS II, Rotterdam Study, and TOZAL study have proved the possibility of correcting the level of MP in the retina when they're taken as food additives, effectively reducing the risk of developing degenerative processes in the retina.
In addition, studies have determined the optimal formula for food additives to stabilize the functionality of the macular area.
The most important components of the additive have been shown include lutein, zeaxanthin, ascorbic acid, selenium, zinc, Î±-tocopherol acetate.
