[Magnetic therapy for complex treatment of chronic periodontal disease].
The aim of the study was to elaborate the methodology of magnetic therapy for complex treatment of chronic periodontal disease (CPD).  The study included 60 patients aged 35 to 65 years with moderate CPD divided in 2 groups.
Patients in group 1 (controls) received impulse carbonate irrigation for 12 min №10, group 2 additionally received magnetic therapy for 5 min №10 in maxillary and mandibular areas.  CLINICAL RESULTS
