[Signal molecules of endometrium: gerontological and general pathhological aspects].  The review describes neuro-immuno-endocrine signal molecules expression in human endometrial cells in the normal conditions, in the pathology and during aging.
Human endometrial cells synthesizes estrogen, progesterone, estradiol, progestin, cell adhesion molecules (integrines α1β1, α4β1, αVβ3, L-selectin, Е-catgerin, MUC1), grow factors (TGF, EGF, HB-EGF, IGF), cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, INF-α, IL-12, СХСL10, CXCL11, CXCR3), various immune cells markers (CD68, CD105, CD163, CD16, CD56, CD4, CD8), heat shock proteins (HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, VEGF, MMP).
Changes of this molecules expression level are the base of the social significant diseases as endometriosis, endometrial cancer and infertility.
Thus, the investigation of neuro-immuno-endocrine interactions in endometrial cells can be used for new drugs creating, in differential diagnostics of endometrial cancer and increasing of extracorporal fertilization success.
