[Short- and long-term results of orbital floor fractures treatment].
The objective of this research was to study complications of orbital floor reconstruction by making analysis of early and late follow up treatment results of patients with orbital floor fractures.
We summerized the experience in surgery of 215 victims with zygomatico-orbital complex fractures, who underwent treatment in teaching hospitals of the oral and maxillo-facial surgery department of Privolzhsky Research Medical University from 2011 to 2017.
The orbital wall fractures which required reconstruction and restorative treatment were diagnosed in 78 (36.3%) patients.
The amount of surgical intervention included transconjuctive approach and orbital floor reconstruction with polymeric and metal implants.
In most cases we obtained good and satisfactory results during the period of early and late follow up.  We made the analysis of developed early and late complications from orbital floor reconstruction.
Post-operative enophthalmos and implant displacement are noted to be the most adverse events in the late follow up period and they require re-surgery.  Our experience suggests that it is possible to avoid complications and receive good esthetic and functional results in case a surgeon is highly qualified and carefully plans an operation, namely calculation of anatomical and topometrical orbit parameters by CT and a right choice of operation methods and implants.
