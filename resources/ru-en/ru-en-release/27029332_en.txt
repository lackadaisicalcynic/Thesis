[The rate of hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients (comparison between the data from the Burdenko Neurosurgical Instutite and the literature) and recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment].  UNLABELLED
Hyponatremia is a relatively frequent and serious complication in patients with various neurosurgical pathologies.  OBJECTIVE
This study is aimed at assessing the incidence of hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients depending on the pathology.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  This paper presents a retrospective analysis 39 479 cases of patients operated on at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute from 2008 to 2014.
RESULTS
A total of 785 hyponatremic patients with Na level lower than 130 mmol/l (2% of all operated patients) were identified.
Mortality in patients with hyponatremia was 14.3%, which is tenfold higher compared to the rest of population of patients without hyponatremia who were operated on during the same period.
In adults, hyponatremia most frequently occurred after resection of craniopharyngiomas (11%) and as a result of acute cerebrovascular accident (22%).
In children, it occurred after resection of craniopharyngiomas (10%), astrocytomas (7%), ependymomas (24%), and germ cell tumors (10.5%).
CONCLUSION
This study, which was mainly statistical one, was not aimed at detailed investigation of hyponatremia in different groups of neurosurgical patients.
We only tried to draw the attention of various experts to those categories of patients, where focused and in-depth developments are more than important.
Obviously, already gained international experience should be taken into account for this  PURPOSE
Therefore, this article presents the literature data on the etiology and pathogenesis of hyponatremia.
We describe the details of the various classifications of hyponatremia, its clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments, primarily based on the recommendations of the last European consensus of various specialists (2014).
