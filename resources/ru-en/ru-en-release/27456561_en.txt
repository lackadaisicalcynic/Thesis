[Patterns of ocular neurovascular reactions].  AIM
To examine factors and determinants of ocular neurovascular reactions (NVR).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included 120 healthy participants of both sexes aged 20.9Â±0.6 years, who underwent a standard ophthalmic examination.
Ocular microcirculation was recorded using laser Doppler flowmetry.
Autonomic homeostasis and the intensity of slow-wave oscillations of hemodynamics were of interest.
Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow was assessed by transcranial color-coded duplex scanning.  RESULTS
The dynamics of perfusion control mechanisms (myogenic and neurogenic) have been studied in the young healthy population of Krasnoyarsk.
The role of the autonomic nervous system in initiating a particular type of ocular NVR has been identified.
The authors have also determined the significance of the nitric oxide production intensity in different types of NVR.  CONCLUSION
The type of ocular NVR is determined by parameters of cerebral hemodynamics.  Normotonic NVR is associated with effective autoregulation of cerebral blood flow, while hyper- and hypotonic types of reactions - with autoregulatory failure.
