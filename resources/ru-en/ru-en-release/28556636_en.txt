[Trends of population aging in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia): socio-demographic aspect].  The scale and the signs of population aging in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), having expressed gender differences, have been defined.
In the course of the analysis it have been revealed that the decline in mortality and life expectancy growth, migratory outflow of young population, reducing the number of children led to an increase in the number of older persons.
It was found that the increase and redistribution of the dependency rate on the working population in the direction of older people acts as a consequence of the aging process.
The survey of the employment behaviour of the elderly population of the Republic showed that the main activity motives of elderly are instrumental and social.
