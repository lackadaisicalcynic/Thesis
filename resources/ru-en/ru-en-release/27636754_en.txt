[The expression of TLR4 and HBD3 in epithelial cells of oral mucosa by surgical treatment of periodontitis].  The expression of TLR4 and HBD3 in epithelial cells of the oral cavity was studied using polymerase chain reaction in real-time in patients with inflammatory and destructive periodontal lesions before and after surgery using osteoplastic material.
Analysis of TLR4 and HBD3 expression in epithelial cells demonstrates the key role of the innate immune factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and destructive periodontal lesions.
TLR4 gene expression was increased 1.5-7.0 times and HBD3 1.5-5.0 times compared to healthy individuals.
Surgical treatment resulted in an effective rehabilitation and normalization of innate immunity.
