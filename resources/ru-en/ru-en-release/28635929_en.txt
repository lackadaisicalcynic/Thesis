[Retinal vascular occlusion and polymorphisms in genes coding for components of vitamin K cycle].  In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the role of polymorphisms in genes that code for the components of vitamin K cycle in the development of retinal vascular occlusion.
Vitamin K serves as a cofactor for a number of blood coagulation factors, namely, factor II, VII, IX, and X, and also for anticoagulation proteins C and S. According to the literature, 1639G4A polymorphism of the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 gene (VKORC1) is likely to be a new risk factor of retinal vascular occlusion.
