[Cytoflavin in the complex therapy of multiple sclerosis].
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy of cytoflavin inclusion in the complex therapy of patients with multiple sclerosis in the remitting form during the period of exacerbation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of therapy of 41 patients matched for sex, age and parameters of clinical and laboratory data were analyzed.
Depending on the scheme of therapy, patients were divided into 2 groups: patients of the first group (n=22) received hormonal therapy with methylprednisolone.  Patients of group II (n=19) received cytoflavin.
The efficacy of treatment was assessed by a set of clinical and laboratory indicators in dynamics - before the start of therapy, with a 10-day interval and after treatment.
The neurological status was assessed with the most commonly used scales (functional system scale (FS), EDSS scale), also neuroimaging data were assessed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The inclusion of cytoflavin as an antioxidant and neuroprotective agent in the therapy of patients with multiple sclerosis in the acute phase increased the efficacy of basic (hormonal) therapy, which is manifested in a significant decrease in the severity of neurologic symptoms and visual system disorders and fewer cases of non-response to treatment.
