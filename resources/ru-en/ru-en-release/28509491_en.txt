[Increase of drainage and immune functions of the lymph node as a factor of endoecological well-being in elderly and senile age].
Age-related changes in mesocolic lymph node reflect the general process of ageing.  In lymph node, these changes are associated with size reduction of structural and functional areas in the setting of manganese excess and iron, zinc, and selenium deficiency, which determines the reduction of lymphoid tissue functional activity in elderly and senile ages.
We have realized the idea to control the lymphatic system functions using phytotherapy.  Phytotherapy provides improving drainage, detoxication, and immune function of the lymph node by increasing the size of functional compartments, intensification of lymphoproliferative processes and mitigating the deficiency of the main trace elements.
The identified lypmhotropic effects of phytotherapy are interconnected with endoecological well-being factor and the increase of nonspecific body resistance in late ontogenesis.
This result is of practical importance for the optimization of endoecological rehabilitation.
