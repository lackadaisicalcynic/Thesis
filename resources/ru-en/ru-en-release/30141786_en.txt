[The influence of anticoagulant and antiagregant therapy during pregnancy on clinical characteristics and outcomes of periventricular hemorrhages in newborns].
AIM
To evaluate the characteristics of periventricular hemorrhages (PVH) in newborns of mothers receiving antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy during pregnancy with hypercoagulation syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and twelve newborns with PVH were evaluated: group 1 - 37 children, born after a pregnancy with hypercoagulation syndrome and antithrombotic therapy; group 2 - 55 children, born after a pregnancy without hypercoagulation syndrome and with preventive antithrombotic therapy; group 3 - 20 children, born after a pregnancy without hypercoagulation syndrome and without antithrombotic therapy.  All newborns underwent clinical and neurologic examinations combined with assessment using special scales and intracranial ultrasound evaluation.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Maternal anticoagulation therapy during pregnancy in groups I and 2 was associated with more severe condition of newborns with PVH (significantly prolonged artificial lung ventilation, more premature births, larger hemorrhage) compared to newborns in group 3.
Follow-up of infants in groups I and 2 demonstrated a significantly slower progress of postural muscle tone, psychological and psychomotor development compared to infants in group 3.  Hypercoagulation syndrome treatment during pregnancy significantly affects the severity of newborn's condition at birth and the development of severe neurological impairments in long-term period.
