Lamin A and lamin-associated polypeptide 2 (LAP-2) in human skin in the process of aging.  At present time, relationships between lamins and processes leading to aging are established.  Mutations of genes of lamins lead to diseases, one of them is progeria.  This disease is caused by violation of splaysing of lamin A gene and accumulation the farnezylated prelamin A (progerin) in the nucleus.
LAP-2 is an important factor which regulates and stabilizes the lamin A.  However, roles of lamin A and LAP-2 in behavior of population of dermal fibroblasts in relation to age were not examined.
The aim of this research was to study A type lamin and LAP-2 in human skin at different ages.  Lamin A and LAP-2 were detected in sections of the skin by indirect immunohistochemistry.
The number of fibroblasts containing lamin A was gradually decreased from 90,4 to 76,9 % from 20 weeks of gestation to 85 years old.
There were 32 % of dermal fibroblasts with positive staining for LAP-2 at the period from 20 weeks of gestation to 20 years old.
From 21 to 40 years, 37,8 % of fibroblasts containing lamin A were found in the dermis.
In age interval 41-85 years, 49-51 % of dermal fibroblasts had a positive staining for LAP-2.  Content of lamin A in the nuclei of fibroblasts was almost constant from 20 weeks of gestation to 85 years old.
Expression of LAP-2 in the nuclei of fibroblasts was reduced from birth to 20 years old but increased from 21 years old.  Number of fibroblasts and PCNA+ fibroblasts in dermis was diminished with age.
The most significant decrease in the number of fibroblasts was observed from 20 weeks of gestation to 20 years old.  Results allow to assume the participation of lamin A and LAP-2 in triggering age-dependent decrease in the number of fibroblasts in the dermis in humans.
