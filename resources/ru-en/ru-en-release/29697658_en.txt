[The patulous Eustachian tube syndrome: the current state of the problem and our own clinical observation.  Part 1].
The patulous Eustachian tube syndrome was described more than 150 years ago, but up to the present time some of its aspects continue to be a challenge for both fundamental and clinical medicine.  Certain issues of etiology and pathogenesis of this condition have until recently remained unclear which probably accounts for the failure of choosing the adequate methods for its medical correction.
Despite the seemingly broad spectrum of the modern tools for the purpose including first and foremost the endoscopic and radiological techniques, verification of the patulous Eustachian tube may encounter difficulties for the specialists.
In connection with this, we have undertaken to summarize the views and opinions as regards the syndrome of interest available in the relevant world literature.  In the first part of this communication, the authors discuss the modern concepts of etiology and pathogenesis of the patulous Eustachian tube syndrome with special reference to its clinical manifestations and methods of diagnostics.
