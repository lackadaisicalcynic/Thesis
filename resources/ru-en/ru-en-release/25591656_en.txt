Objective.  To estimate the level of recognition of Alzheimer disease (AD) and awareness about its causes, medical help and its efficacy in general population.
Material and methods.
Authors questioned 1043 Chuvashia residents (391 men and 652 women), aged from 18 to 81 years  (mean age - 41.5Â±16.3 years ), using vignettes (a clinical "picture" of disease).
A vignette describes the stages of AD (subclinical, mild, moderate and severe).
Results.
AD was determined correctly by 13.6% of respondents.
Most difficulties were associated with definition of subclinical stage of disease (6.1% of correct answers).
Good AD recognition depended on the level of education, including medical knowledge, age of respondents and previous experience with such cases.
Visit to doctor was recommended by 83.1% (in most cases it was neurologist - 33%).
The improvement of mental condition in illustrated cases was supposed by 60%, no improvement - 28.9%, deterioration - 1.7%, without answer - 9.4% of respondents.
Conclusion.
These data indicates the low level of mental health literacy in the general population, especially on preclinical stage of AD.  That needs to be corrected by psychiatric education at a general level.
