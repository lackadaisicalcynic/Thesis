[Antithrombotic treatment as primary and secondary prevention of stroke].  The use of antithrombotic drugs (ATD) is necessary in the treatment and prevention of thrombosis.
The correction of risk factors of ischemic stroke (IS) and transitory ischemic attacks (TIA) is important as well.  The drugs inhibiting the activation and aggregation of thrombocytes allow to decrease the number of myocardial infarctions by 35%, stroke by 25% and mortality from cardiovascular causes by 15%.
Currently, the clinical efficacy of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), thienopyridines (ticlopidine, clopidogrel), dipyridamole or the combination of dipyridamole and ASA as well as glycoprotein antagonists IIb-IIIa for intravenous introduction have been confirmed.
A review of experimental and clinical studies confirming the efficacy of dipyridamole in the treatment of acute stage of stroke and primary and secondary prevention of II is presented.
