[Comorbidity of migraine and epilepsy in childhood].  Migraine and epilepsy represent prevalent chronic neurological disorders of childhood.
Migraine and epilepsy comorbidity relies on the common pathophysiologic and genetic mechanisms of the paroxysmal disorders the similarity of their precipitating factors, clinical manifestations and therapeutic approaches.  The problems of differential diagnosis of migraine and epilepsy are related to peculiarities of migraine manifestations in children.
Some forms of epilepsy could be accompanied by cephalgic seizures.
The diagnostic criteria of headaches in epileptic patients are presented.  A number of genetic diseases accompanying by migraine and epilepsy could be a model for delineation of shared pathogenetic mechanisms of these paroxysmal disorders in which genetically determined channelopathies may play an important role.
The efficacy of antiepileptic drugs has been proven as the prophylactic treatment of migraine in pediatric patients.  The advantages of levetiracetam as the prophylactic treatment for migraine and epilepsy comorbidity in children are discussed.
