[A case of treating a patient with a false aneurysm of the xenoconduit of the ascending aorta and pronounced cardiac insufficiency].  Described in the article is a clinical case of treating a previously operated patient presenting with a pseudoaneurysm of the xenoconduit of the ascending aortic portion, functioning Cabrol fistula and pronounced cardiac insufficiency, who was admitted to our institution in the state of decompensation.
The obtained outcomes of treating this patient demonstrated a possibility of successfully using vascular grafts for establishing an anastomosis between the left coronary artery and ascending portion of the aorta in complicated conditions of a repeat intervention.
