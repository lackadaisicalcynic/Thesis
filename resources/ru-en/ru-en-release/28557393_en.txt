[Melatonin as a marker of the grade of cardiac disorders during cachexia development in oncological patients of different ages].  We have examined 103 patients at the age from 28 to 78 with the newly diagnosed oncological disease at stages II-IV before the beginning of anticancer treatment.
The identification of the signs of the cachexia syndrome and its stage (pre-cachexia, cachexia) were carried out in the accordance with the CASCO criteria (2011) and taking into the account the age of the patients.
The cardiovascular infringements were found to be comorbid to the oncological disease significantly more often in patients with signs of cachexia syndrome on the pre-cachexia stage and the total index of cardiovascular disorders in oncological patients increases with the severity of cachexia.
In the course of the cachexia symptoms development the significant decline of melatonin excretion level (evaluated by the excretion of its main metabolite 6-sulfatoximelatonin level - aMT6s) in oncological patients was noted.
The lowest changes in aMT6s levels were observed in patients older than 60 years, referred to the group of pre-cachexia, which may indicate the heterogeneity of the investigated groups as a result of the combination of manifestations of geriatric syndromes and cancer pathology.
The possibility of false-positive diagnosis of pre-cachexia due to a combination of polygenic metabolic and age-related changes in elderly patients should be taken into account.
Therefore, evaluation of melatonin excretion can be recommended as an additional marker in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of cachexia syndrome particularly in geriatric patients.  A significant correlation between the occurrence and/or worsening of cardiac disease in cancer patients, cachexia symptoms and reduced level of aMT6s were revealed.
