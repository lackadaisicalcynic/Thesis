[Treatment of a woman with phlegmasia cerulea dolens complicated by massive pulmonary thromboembolism and intestinal haemorrhage].
Acute thrombosis of the lower limb deep veins remains one of the most common vascular diseases.
It is characterised by formation of thrombotic masses in the system of the deep veins of the lower extremities.
A serious complication associated with deep vein thrombosis is pulmonary embolism.  In rare cases, under certain conditions a massive and disseminated blockade of the venous outflow with thrombotic masses may lead to ischaemia of the extremity with the formation of superficial and deep necroses and later on to gangrene.
One of the main components of management is long-term administration of anticoagulants, which in a series of cases may result in the development of gastrointestinal haemorrhage which in its turn requires discontinuation of anticoagulants.
Described herein is a clinical case report concerning treatment of a woman presenting with deep vein thrombosis and the development of phlegmasia cerulean dolens complicated by massive pulmonary artery thromboembolism on the background of intestinal bleeding.
