[The wounds of the neck].  The author presents his personal observation of a complex wound on the neck treated with a favourable outcome.
Prior to the surgical intervention, the efficient intubation was performed by an anesthesiologist through the wound at the frontal surface of the neck which communicated with the cavity of the oropharynx.
The revision showed the injury to the superior thyroid artery branching off from the external carotid artery.
Ligation of the vessel did not cause the deterioration of cervical circulation.
The long-term hemostasis was achieved, Thereafter, the mid-tracheostomy was performed and the nasogastric tube installed.
The wound was copiously washed with an antiseptic solution.
The layer by layer suturing of the mucous membrane of the oropharynx was carried out.
The hyoid bone was sutured to the soft tissues of the floor of the mouth, and the oropharynx was reconstructed.
The soft tissues were juxtaposed and sutured.
The rubber graduates were removed on day 3 after the termination of the surgical intervention.
The tracheostomy tube and nasogastric tube were removed on the 7th day and the 10th day after surgery respectively.
The wound healed by primary intention.
The patient was discharged from the hospital in the satisfactory condition on the 14th postoperative day.
