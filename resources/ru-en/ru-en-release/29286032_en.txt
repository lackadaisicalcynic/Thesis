[Bidirectional knotless barbed sutures during primary total knee arthroplasty: effective solution or new problem?]
THE HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY
The use of bidirectional knotless barbed sutures for closure of capsule and subcutaneous fat tissue in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is safe and time-saving.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
302 patients with end-stage osteoarthritis scheduled for primary non-complex TKA were randomly divided into two prospective groups: in group I (N=102) the capsule of the knee joint and subcutaneous fat tissues were closed by continuous braided suture while in group II (N=200) by bidirectional knotless barbed sutures.  The skin in both groups was closed by non-absorbable monofilament polycaproamide uninterrupted suture.
The time of the surgery was significantly shorter in group II (65,25±11,9 min) than in group I (72,5±14,7 min) (p<0.05). The volume of hidden blood loss was similar in both groups.  The number of patients with superficial infection during the first two week after surgery did not differ significantly (1,9% (I) and 1% (II)): they all healed successfully after skin debridement and additional closure.
There were no cases of deep periprosthetic infection (PPI).  At 3-month follow-up no difference found regarding pain level and knee function (Knee Society Score).
CONCLUSION
The use of bidirectional knotless barbed sutures in TKA reduces the time of surgery, does not affect the volume of hidden blood loss or PPI occurrence.
