[Nevi of conjunctiva as a risk factor of melanoma].  UNLABELLED
Conjunctival nevi are the most common tumors of this location.  They are usually unilateral, although bilateral cases may also be met.
As to clinical presentation, all nevi are divided into: stationary or progressive nevi, blue nevi, and primary acquired melanosis.  Color changes are acceptable, if they occur during pregnancy or puberty.
However, if postpubertal, such changes should be considered alarming, as to possible malignization.  Histopathologically, nevi are composed of melanocyte clusters in the skin stroma next to the basal layer of the epidermis.
AIM
To analyze the significance of timely removal of conjunctival nevi for melanoma prevention.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 52 patients were examined during 2009-2013.  Of them, 48 patients had nevi of the conjunctiva and/or lacrimal caruncle, 1 patient was diagnosed with caruncular melanoma and 3 other - with conjunctival melanoma.
RESULTS
Patients with stationary nevi are still being followed up.
Of those who were surgically treated, none developed recurrence.
Taking into account high metastatic activity of melanomas and that discovering metastases does not always happen together with diagnosing the primary lesion (often, years after treatment), the follow-up of melanoma patients must be lifelong.  CONCLUSION
Timely removal of progressive conjunctival nevi is able to prevent malignancy, of which the outcome may be very unfavorable.
