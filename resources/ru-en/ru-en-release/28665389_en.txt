[Syringosubarachnoid shunting in treatment of syringomyelia: a literature review and a clinical case report].  In the article, we describe a clinical case of syringomyelia associated with an Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, evaluate the efficacy of syringosubarachnoid shunting, and analyze the literature data of domestic and international researchers involved in investigation and treatment of the pathology.
Application of syringosubarachnoid shunting in the described case resulted in a clinical improvement in the form of regression of paresis and hypoesthesia, which demonstrated the efficacy of the shunting technique for correction of the syringomyelia symptoms.
