[EEG spectral characteristics during heart rate variability biofeedback in healthy people].
AIM  To evaluate changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral characteristics during a single session of heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV BF).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and fifty adolescents, aged 16-17 years, were studied.
Adolescents of the BF-group (n=110) conducted HRV BF session to enhance vagal influences on the heart rhythm.  Adolescents of the control group (n=40) remained in relaxed resting state.
EEG was recorded with eyes closed before and after BF training.
EEG absolute spectral power values of parts without artifacts in each frequency band were determined.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The ability of the volunteer to change the heart rhythm activity determines the extent of its impact on the functions of central autonomic structures.
This method of BF training helps to improve the cortical stability: an increase in alpha- and decrease in theta EEG-activity.
The synchronization process of brain activity in the dynamics of BF training is most clearly manifested in the right brain hemisphere, with the frequent involvement of prefrontal brain areas.
