[The application of cybernetic modeling methods for the forensic medical personality identification based on the voice and sounding speech characteristics].  The objective of the present publication was to discuss the possibility of application of cybernetic modeling methods to overcome the apparent discrepancy between two kinds of the speech records, viz. initial ones (e.g. obtained in the course of special investigation activities) and the voice prints obtained from the persons subjected to the criminalistic examination.
The paper is based on the literature sources and the materials of original criminalistics expertises performed by the authors.
