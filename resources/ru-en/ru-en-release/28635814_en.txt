[The biological activity of high-density lipoprotein fractions and their role in the development of cardiovascular diseases].  Increasing the human plasma concentration of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) may be part of strategy for control of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).
HDL particles vary in their structure, metabolism, and biological activity.  The review describes major HDL fractions (subpopulations) and discusses new findings on the antiatherogenic properties of HDL particles.
The whole spectrum of HDL fractions, small, dense, protein-rich lipoproteins, has atheroprotective properties that are determined by the presence of specialized groups of proteins and lipids; however, this activity may be decreased in atherogenic lesion.
Comprehensive structural and compositional analysis of HDL may provide key information to identify the fractions that have characteristic biological properties and lose their functionality in CVD.
These fractions may be also biomarkers for the risk of CVD and hence represent pharmacological targets.
