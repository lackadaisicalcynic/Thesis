[Quality of life for men of different ages in the russian European North and its relationship with self-reported health and hormonal status].  Assessment of the quality of life for male inhabitants of the Russian European North demonstrated decreased indices of physical health component (the scale of role functioning determined by physical condition) and mental health component (the scales of social functioning and role functioning determined by emotional state and mental health) compared to the inhabitants of Siberia as a comparison group.
Men aged up to 29 had the highest values at all scales.  The values decreased with age.
The most prominent decrease was observed for the scales of general well-being and pain intensity.  There was a moderate decrease for the scales of physical functioning, role functioning determined by emotional state, and role functioning determined by physical condition.
Quality of life was closely related to self-reported health of northerners, pathological index, molecular marker of aging, and biological age.
Negative correlation between these values implies the deterioration of physical and mental health with biological age.
The quality of life for northerners also correlated with hormonal status.  There was a relationship between testosterone and three scales of physical health components; between cortisol and one scale of physical component; and between both dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and insulin and the scales of physical and mental components of health.
The effect of various hormones on different age groups of northerners was demonstrated.
