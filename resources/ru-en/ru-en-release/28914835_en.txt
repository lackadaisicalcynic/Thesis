[Surgical treatment of pain syndrome in lumbar spine in patients with obesity].  AIM
To analyze the reduction of pain severity, time of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, incidence of unintentional lesion of dura mater, infectious complications and hospital-stay after lumbar microdiscectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included 104 patients aged 24-58 years (37 men and 67 women, mean age 45 years) who underwent lumbar microdiscectomy within January 2015 - June 2016.
The main and control groups consisted of 48 and 56 patients with and without obesity respectively.
In all cases lumbar microdiscectomy was made.  Pain syndrome was assessed by visual analogue scale and Oswestry questionnaire.
RESULTS
In 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months after surgery significant improvement of both lumbar and leg pain was observed.  Significantly reduced pain was stable and similar in both groups within follow-up although there was a tendency to increased pain in long-term period in group 1.
Blood loss and infections were slightly higher in obese group while surgery time and hospital-stay were significantly higher in these patients.  CONCLUSION
Features of patients with excessive body weight should be considered prior to elective surgery.  Probably, implants are advisable to stabilize spinal motion segment and improve the outcomes among patients with excessive body weight.
