[The dynamics of the dimensional characteristics of the sella turcica in the subjects above 20 years of age].  The objective of the present study was to determine the biological age of the unidentified dead subjects based on the morphometric characteristics of the sella turcica in comparison with other methods available for the purpose in order to narrow the range of the alleged ages of the human remains being examined.
The parameters of the sella turcica were measured in the corpses immediately after cephalotomy provided no pathological changes could be identified in the sellar region.
A total of 86 skulls of the Caucasoid subjects representing the Eastern-Slavic group at the age varying from 22 to 87 years were available for the examination.
The study has demonstrated the undulating dynamics of dimensional characteristics of the sellae turcica during the course of a lifetime.
The regression analysis was employed to predict the age of the subjects above 22 years of age based on the measurements of the length and depth of the sella turcica and to classify the sample of interest within a given age period.
It is concluded that the morphometric characteristics of the sells turcica can be used as the additional clues for the purpose of age determination in forensic medical investigations.
