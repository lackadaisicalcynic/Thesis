[Influence of gerodietetic meat pate on metabolic parameters in the elderly: the role of vitamin B12].
Many studies indicate essential nature of food in maintaining health.
An important factor is the consumption of a variety of essential elements, in particular vitamins.  The aim was to determine the relationship of vitamin B12 levels in serum with metabolic parameters and the possibility of correction using gerodietetic meat pate.
A total of 23 older people (60-80 years) were surveyed.
We determined index mass body, waist circumference, biochemical indicators, vitamin B12 concentration in serum and food consumption (by frequency method).  We also measured changes in these parameters under the influence of eating gerodietetic meat pate.
The older adults often demonstrate deficient in vitamin B12 in the blood (about 65 % of the surveyed), which may be contributed both by its lack of dietary intake and malabsorption due to pathological changes in the digestive system.
The content of vitamin B12 in the blood of the elderly has been closely linked to metabolic indicators and body mass.
Using gerodietetic meat pate promoted not only the elimination of vitamin B12 deficiency, but also significantly improved the biochemical markers of protein, and especially lipid metabolism in the elderly (decreased low-density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein increased).
