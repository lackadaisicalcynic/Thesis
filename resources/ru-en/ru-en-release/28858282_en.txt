[Assessment of caries risk factors among school-age children by comparing EGOHID scores in Minsk and Moscow].  The aim of the study was to assess the acceptability of the objective and subjective indicators for identification of oral diseases risk factors and the quality of dental care of school-aged children.
The study included 200 school children of two age groups (12 and 15-year-old) surveyed in Minsk and Moscow cities using European global system of oral health indicators development (EGOHID).  The modified WHO questionnaire was used to study behavioral habits of 15-year-old children.
There were significant variations in the most indicators studied in different localities.
An average DMFT of permanent teeth varied from 3.1 to 4.7 in 12-year-olds and from 5.5 to 6.5 in 15-year-olds.
The prevalence of periodontal disease has reached 42%.  The complex of objective and subjective evaluation of the teeth and gums status made it possible to reveal a number of risk factors.
The majority of EGOHID indicators had shown satisfactory acceptability and specificity in assessing the risk factors and preliminary evaluation of a quality of dental care for school children.  The EGOHID system is recommended for monitoring the preventive programs.
