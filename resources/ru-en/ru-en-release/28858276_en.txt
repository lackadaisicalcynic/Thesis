[Surgical treatment of patients with arteriovenous head and neck angiodisplasia].  The aim of the study was to assess the results of surgical treatment in 74 patients with extensive arteriovenous angiodisplasia in the head and neck area.
All patients underwent complex examination including ultrasound, CT and MRI with contrast and selective carotid angiography.
The lesions excision was performed after endovascular embolization and soft tissue defects were restored by various methods selected according to prevalent vascular lesion type (arterial, arteriovenous, venous, capillary) and blood flow values (high flow, low flow, mixed).
Good and satisfactory esthetic results were seen in 95.2% of cases, lesion relapse was detected in 4.8% of cases by 12-18 months follow-up.
Endovascular embolization proved to decrease the intraoperative bleeding risk, prevent lesion relapse and minimize the size of the lesion improving the results of radical treatment.
Local flap reconstruction usually results in good esthetic results.
By local soft tissue deficiency distant free flaps or microsurgical complex flaps may be used.
