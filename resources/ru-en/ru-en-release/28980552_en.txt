[The role of the comprehensive approach for the characteristic of the destructive effect of a non-lethal cartridge with two rubber bullets].
This article was designed to report the results of forensic medical, criminalistics, and comprehensive expertise of the subject who suffered from a non-perforating shotgun wound affecting the soft tissues and blood vessels in the femoral region.  It was shown that only the scrutinous comprehensive full-scale expert examination of the injured site in the framework of forensic medical expertise makes it possible to exclude the probability of the expert error and formulate the reliable and substantiated conclusion as regards the fact and the conditions of the shotgun injury by a concrete type of the cartridge (e.g. having a caliber equal to 410/76 Stopper-2) with two spherical rubber bullets fired from a known weapon (Saiga-410S hunting carbine).
