[The trans-eyebrow supraorbital approach for removal of anterior cranial fossa and suprasellar meningiomas].  Over the past two decades, improvements in surgical tools, navigation systems, and endoscopic techniques have resulted in the widespread use of keyhole surgery for a wide range of skull base tumors.
Currently, the trans-eyebrow supraorbital approach is being increasingly used in surgery for anterior cranial fossa and parasellar tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 7 patients who underwent surgery for meningioma using the trans-eyebrow supraorbital approach at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute in the period between 2013 and 2017.
The age of patients ranged from 51 to 75 years (median, 60 years); there were 5 females and 2 males.
The maximum diameter of resected tumors ranged from 20 to 60 mm (median 40 mm).
RESULTS
Total resection of the tumor was achieved in all 7 cases, which was confirmed by postoperative MRI control.
All 7 patients had a good cosmetic result.
In 1 case, there was postoperative cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea due to incomplete closure of the frontal sinus, which required the patient to be re-operated.
None of 7 cases was associated with injury to the main vessels or cavernous sinus.
CONCLUSION
Supraorbital trans-eyebrow craniotomy provides a minimally invasive approach for removing most anterior cranial fossa base and suprasellar tumors.
The advantages of keyhole surgery, in comparison with traditional craniotomies, are minimal complications associated with the approach.
