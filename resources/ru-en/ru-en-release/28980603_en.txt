[Cervical vertigo from the perspective of an otorhinolaryngologist].  At present, the skeptical attitude toward the term 'cervical vertigo' (CV) predominates in the ENT-community.
Such point of view is attributable to the absence of specific CV symptoms and well-defined diagnostic criteria.
The present literature review was designed to consider the results of the clinical observations and experimental investigations obtained during the past 150 years that give evidence of the possibility to regard cervical vertigo as a separate nosological entity.
The characteristic signs of this condition are analyzed and systematized.  Four CV variants are currently distinguished.
The principles of diagnostics and treatment of cervical vertigo are discussed and general concept of CV is formulated.
