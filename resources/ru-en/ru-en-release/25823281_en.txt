[An important stage in the development of field therapy (on the 70th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War)].  Much previous experience accumulated by physicians in various wars and local military conflicts provides strong evidence that it is necessary to set up a harmonious system to deliver therapeutic care during wartime, which is based on the unity of views on the origin, course, and treatment of pathological processes having regard to the specific conditions under which armed forces are involved in combat operations.
This all has given rise to the new branch of therapy--field therapy.
The Great Patriotic War was the most important stage in the development of Russian field therapy, which was characterized by the setting up of the effective and scientifically ground system to deliver therapeutic care to the wounded and patients, which was based on the tenets of a uniform field medical doctrine.
