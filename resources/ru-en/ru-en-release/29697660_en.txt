[The topographical and anatomical characteristic of the anterior part of the external auditory passage and the tympanic cavity].
The objective of the present work was to overview the currently available literature data on microtopographic anatomy of the anterior portion of the middle ear and the external auditory passage.  Manipulations on these structures during miringoplasty surgery appear to be the most difficult and laborious operations because this space is anatomically very narrow and curved; moreover, it contains the important intimate structures of the middle ear and is located very close to the temporomandibular joint.
The knowledge of microsurgical anatomy of the anterior part of the middle ear and the external auditory passage is paramount in the context of the improvement of the professional skills of the surgeons.
The current literature data provide a basis for the conclusion that many aspects of microsurgical anatomy of the anterior part of the tympanic cavity and the external auditory passage thus far remain poorly explored.  This assertion is especially true as regards the relief of the mucous membrane overlying these structure and their supply with arterial blood.
Further clarification of these aspects is needed.
