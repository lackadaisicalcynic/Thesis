[Spectral correction of vision and electrophysiological measurements of the eye].
Spectral light filters - glasses and intraocular lenses - are widely used in ophthalmology and optometry.  Light filters help increase vision clarity, contrast and quality in patients with ocular media opacities and other eye diseases.
The article describes the types of light filters and the methods of their clinical application, and presents data on the influence of intra- and extraocular spectral correction on electrophysiological parameters of the retina.
