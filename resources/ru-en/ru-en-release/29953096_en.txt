[Transtumoral decompression in acute left-sided colonic obstruction].  AIM
To prove an effectiveness of transtumoral decompression in patients with acute malignant left-sided colonic obstruction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  154 patients with acute left-side colonic obstruction were enrolled.
Patients were divided into 4 groups.  In groups 1-3 (n=120) patients underwent surgery at the moment of colonic obstruction, in 34 patients obstruction was managed with transtumoral decompression followed by radical surgery.
Self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) were used in these patients.
Radical and palliative procedures at the moment of colonic obstruction are associated with high rate of postoperative complications and mortality.
RESULTS
Transtumoral decompression in malignant colonic obstruction resolves the main objectives of complicated colonic cancer management: absence of surgical trauma, endotracheal narcosis, reduced risk of abdominal infection, possible multidisciplinary assessment of patient's status and preparation for radical surgery.
