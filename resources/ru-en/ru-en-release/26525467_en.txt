[The specific clinical features of otogenic intracranial complications: the current views].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the specific clinical features of otogenic intracranial complications (ICC) encountered in the current otorhinolaryngological practice.
The work is based on the results of the retrospective analysis of 106 adult patients presenting with otogenic intracranial complications admitted for the treatment to multidisciplinary clinics of Sankt-Peterburg and Krasnoyarsk.
Forty six (42.5%) patients presented with acute otitis media.  90% of them had suppurative destructive mastoiditis.
In sixty (56.6%) patients, chronic suppurative otitis media (epitympanophonia) was associated with the extensive destructive process spreading toward dura mater of the medial and posterior cranial fossae and onto the sigmoid sinus.
The prevalence of intracranial complications among the adult patients suffering from suppurative otitis media and treated in the otorhinolaryngological clinics amounted to 3.17%.
The overall structure of otogenic intracranial complications was as follows: meningitis 42.5%, brain and cerebellum abscess 24.5%, suppurative meningoencephalitis 19.8%, sinus thrombosis 5.7%, epidural and subdural empyemas 4.7%, the combined suppurative brain lesions 2.8%.
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sepsis) was diagnosed in 33 (31%) patients with otogenic ICC.
The high intrahospital mortality rate among the patients with this condition (20.8%) is emphasized.
The main causes of the fatal outcome in the patients with otogenic intracranial complications are supposed to be brain oedema with the concomitant development of dyslocation syndrome and sepsis.
