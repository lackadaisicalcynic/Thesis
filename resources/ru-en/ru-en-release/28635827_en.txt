[Idiopathic epiretinal membranes: visual function impairment, morphological and functional features of retinal involvement].  By affecting different retinal layers, an idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iERM) produces changes in macular architectonics and functioning.
Morphological and functional assessment of these patients using modern visualization methods and electroretinography contributes to a better understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms of iERM.
