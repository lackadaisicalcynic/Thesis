[Dexketoprofen trometamol in dorsalgia treatment].  Lower back pain (LBP) remains an important problem due to its high prevalence.
LBP is the fifth in frequency among reasons for seeking treatment, and one of the most common among the chronic pain syndromes.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered to be the «gold standard» in relieving back pain.  In treatment of acute musculoskeletal pain syndromes, special attention is drawn to drugs characterized by high analgesic activity and a short half-life.
Among the drugs in this group, dexketoprofen (a derivative of propionic acid), a water-soluble salt of the dextrorotatory enantiomer of ketoprofen, deserves special attention.
Over the last decade, a number of studies have shown the high efficacy of dexketoprofen trometamol.
