[Skin receptors and therapeutic physical factors].  This review presents the data on the receptor function of the skin and its role in the formation of the body's response to the action of physical therapy.
Especially much attention is given in the paper to the influence of ultrasound, microwaves, laser radiation, various medical environments, and other physical factors on the morphofunctional condition of the skin receptors.
Possible mechanisms of changes in receptor activity under effects of physical therapeutic factors are analyzed.
Moreover, the paper summarizes the directions of further possible studies on the interactions between physical factors and cutaneous receptors.
