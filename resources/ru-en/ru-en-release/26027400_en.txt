[Immunohistochemical examination of skin biopsy specimens with calculation of C fibers in the diagnosis of polyneuropathy].
The paper discusses the anatomy of innervation of the skin, the epidermis and dermis in particular, which are related to pain, the markers of skin nerves and cells.
It gives data on the diagnosis of fine unmyelinated fibers, by immunohistochemically examining skin biopsy specimens.
The paper also describes the morphometry of skin nerves: intraepidermal nerve fibers, dermal nerve fibers, and autonomic nerve fibers.  It discusses whether a skin biopsy specimen may be used to diagnose polyneuropathies of different etiology: diabetic, immune, HIV-related, and hereditary ones.
