[Isolated sacral injury in hairy cell leukemia: A case report and analysis of literature data].  Hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disease with special villous morphology and immunophenotypic markers of lymphoid cells, is characterized by the involvement of bone marrow and spleen.
The paper describes a case of a 29-year-old female patient without abnormal clinical blood tests and myelograms, with normal spleen sizes, in whom the only manifestation of HCL was massive scrotal injury with a soft tissue component in the small pelvic cavity.
