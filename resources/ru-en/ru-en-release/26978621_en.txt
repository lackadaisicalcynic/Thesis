AIM  To reveal calcium metabolism disorders that frequently occur after thyroid surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 202 patients who underwent thyroid surgery for different diseases and had normal calcium level in peripheral blood at baseline.
RESULTS
Based on laboratory data postoperative hypocalcemia was diagnosed in 57 (28.8%) patients.
It was not always accompanied by clinical symptoms.
Clinical picture depended on degree of hypocalcemia.  Symptoms was diagnosed more frequently if calcium concentration was less than 2.1 mmol/l.
Clinical manifestations were absent in 64.9% of cases on background of hypocalcemia.  Incidence of hypocalcemia was higher after thyroidectomy compared to organ-preserving surgery.
Symptoms of hypocalcemia occurred after thyroidectomy only.  Casual parathyroidectomy does not always cause hypocalcemia.
Only in 14% of patients with hypocalcemia excised parathyroid was identified in specimen.
At the same time 7.6% of patients with postoperative normocalcaemia also had excised parathyroids in specimens.
Symptoms of hypocalcemia does not always occur at 1 day after surgery.
They can appear later, for example at 5 days postoperatively and depend on severity of hypocalcemia.
Thyroidectomy has high risk of postoperative hypocalcemia with clinical symptoms (19.6%) that is transient in 15.5% of cases and permanent in 4.1% of patients.
