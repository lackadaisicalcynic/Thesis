[The outcomes of different pancreatodigestive anastomoses in pancreatoduodenectomy].
AIM
To compare early results after pancreaticoduodenectomy depending on variant of pancreatico-digestive anastomosis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was analyzed early results of 207 pancreaticoduodenectomies for cancer which were performed for the period 2010-2014.  Pancreatointestinal and pancreatogastric anastomoses were applied in 165 and 42 patients respectively.
RESULTS
Complications were observed in 73 (44.2%) and 18 (38.3%) patients after pancreatointestinal and pancreatogastric anastomoses respectively.  Six patients died after pancreatointestinal anastomosis.
At the same time there were no deaths in the group of pancreatogastric anastomosis.
Differences were significant.  Postoperative hospital-stay was similar in both groups.
