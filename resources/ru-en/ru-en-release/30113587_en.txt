[Surgical resolutions determining outcomes of infected pancreatic necrosis].
AIM
To evaluate technology, indications and time of minimally invasive semi-closed and laparotomic sanations for infected pancreatic necrosis (IP).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Initially it was used sonography-assisted minimally invasive semi-closed drainage of IP with gradual augmentation of catheters' diameter.  In 462 patients with IP liquid pus prevailed over sequesters in epigastric localized pancreatonecrotic phlegmon (ELPF) and pancreatonecrotic abscesses.
So, minimally invasive approach may be definitive.  Epigastric advanced pancreatonecrotic phlegmon with predominant sequesters is often followed by conversion to transverse omentobursopancreatostomy (OBPS) to open all purulent accumulations.
RESULTS
Surgical treatment immediately after parapancreatic infiltrate suppuration (i.e. within 3-4 weeks after onset of the disease) is associated with reduced mortality.
Absent result of minimally invasive drainage is followed by mortality from the 11th day and maximum in 14 days after treatment onset.
Therefore, focal IP resistant to minimally invasive drainage requires conversion to transverse OBPS or video-assisted sequestrectomy after 10-13 days.
The lowest mortality (14.8±2.5%) was observed in patients who underwent minimally invasive drainage or transverse OBPS within 10-13 days.  Ineffective prolonged minimally invasive drainage was accompanied by high mortality rate (60.7±3.2%, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION  Conversion to transverse OBPS or video-assisted sequestrectomy are required if minimally invasive drainage of IP is ineffective after 10-13 days.
Clear understanding of indications for closed and open drainage of PI helps to avoid tactical and technological errors.
