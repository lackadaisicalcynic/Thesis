[The results of a comparative randomized study on the effectiveness of various methods for the correction of the nasal valve: the subjective evaluation].
The objective of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of several extensively used techniques for the correction of the nasal valve in terms of the main clinical manifestations with the application of various scales for subjective evaluation of the outcomes of the treatment.  It was demonstrated in the course of this prospective study that the patients described the elimination of nasal valve dysfunction with the help of expanding transplants as the most effective method in terms of the improvement of nasal breathing and the achievement of the acceptable aesthetic results.
The plastic correction with the use of local tissues was reported to be less efficacious even if ensuring the stable result.  This method did not worsen the shape of the nose but failed to remove its existing cosmetic defect.
As far as the aesthetic outcome of the treatment is concerned, the suture correction technique was recognized to be the least efficacious approach because it resulted in the deterioration of the nose shape in more than half of the cases.
