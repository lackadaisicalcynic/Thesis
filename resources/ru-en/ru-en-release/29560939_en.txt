[Effectiveness of the tenoxicam in patients with ankylosing spondylitis].
AIM  To study the changes in pain syndrome and its characteristic in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who received tenoxicam after non-effective treatment with NSAIDs on the 'on-demand' basis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty patients with AS, who had BASDAI â‰¥4.0 at baseline and after 52 weeks of NSAIDs on the 'on-demand' basis, were randomized into 2 groups: 30 patients were prescribed 20 mg of tenoxicam oraly per day, 10 patients continued previous therapy.
The BASDAI, ASDAS indices were calculated in 52 and 56 weeks.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
BASDAI and ASDAS indices decreased in patients treated with tenoxicam, the AS activity in patients with on-demand NSAID intake did not change.
The change of the ineffective long-term NSAID intake in the 'on-demand' basis to permanent drug intake was associated with a rapid (within 4 weeks) decrease in the clinical activity of ankylosing spondylitis.
