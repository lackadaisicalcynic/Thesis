[Optical coherence tomography angiography in paracentral acute middle maculopathy (a case report)].  PURPOSE
To describe a case of paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) from the perspective of multimodal visualization and characterize it using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Multimodal imaging of the eye structures was used to investigate the right eye of a patient with PAMM.  Infrared scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (IR-SLO), scanning laser ophthalmoscopy in autofluorescence mode and fluorescein angiography (FAG) were performed with scanning laser ophthalmoscope F-10 ('Nidek Co', Japan).
Spectral domain OCT and OCT-A were performed with Copernicus REVO ('OPTOPOL Technology', Poland).  RESULTS
IR-SLO showed paracentral hyporeflective area less than one optic nerve head in measure corresponding to an area of early hypofluorescence seen in FAG.
OCT results included hyperreflectivity of the inner nuclear layer and slight decrease of central retinal thickness.  OCT-A revealed hyperperfusion area in superficial retinal capillary plexus and hypoperfusion area in deep retinal capillary plexus.
CONCLUSION
OCT-A is the most informative method for PAMM diagnostics.
OCT-A findings confirm the vascular nature of PAMM.  Separate analyses of retinal capillary plexuses with OCT-A evidences ischemia occurring mainly in deep retinal capillary.
