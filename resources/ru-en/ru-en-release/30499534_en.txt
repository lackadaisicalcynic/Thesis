PURPOSE  To compare the wavefront and accommodation parameters without correction and in soft contact lenses (SCL) in natural and cycloplegic conditions in eyes with myopia and hyperopia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 142 myopic (mean -5.6±1.4 D) and 48 hyperopic (mean +3.5±1.1 D) eyes were examined in 95 patients aged 5-32 years (mean age 16.9±0.9 years) to compare the wavefront aberrations without correction and with different SCL before and after cycloplegia (two drops of cyclopentolate hydrochloride 1%).
The device was set up for 4 mm zone for both narrow and wide pupils.
To compare the accommodation parameters under different correction conditions, 85 patients aged 8-23 years (mean age 14.9±0.6 years) with average myopia of (-)5.27±1.4D (123 eyes) and average hyperopia of +3.53±1.2 D (46 eyes) were chosen from the study group.
Among the measured parameters are objective accommodative response (OAR), relative accommodation reserves (RAR), pseudoaccumulation amplitude (PA), higher-order aberrations: RMSHOAs, 6-9 Trefoil, 7-8 Coma, spherical aberration (SA).
RESULTS
In myopic eyes with SCL Coma 7 decreases, Coma 8 increases with transition to positive values, and Trefoil 9 increases.
In hyperopic eyes, trefoil 6 decreases, Coma 7-8 go negative.
In myopic or hyperopic eyes with SCL, SA goes from positive to negative.
In both myopia and hyperopia, accommodation and PA rates are higher in SCL than in glasses.
CONCLUSION
SCL change certain wavefront parameters for myopia and hyperopia in different ways.
The accommodation parameters in SCL are elevated in both myopia and hyperopia.
The negative spherical aberration induced by contact lenses improves the accommodative response.
The revealed features should be considered in the development of correction methods that target refractogenesis.
