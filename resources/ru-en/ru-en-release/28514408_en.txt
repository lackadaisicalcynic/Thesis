[Asymptomatic atherosclerosis of the brachiocephalic arteries: Current approaches to diagnosis and treatment].  Acute cerebrovascular accident (ACVA) and transient ischemic attack are among the leading causes of morbidity, disability, and mortality in the Russian Federation and the world.
Ischemic strokes account for 70-80% of all ACVAs, with 20-30% of them being associated with stenotic atherosclerosis of the brachiocephalic arteries (BCA).
The paper describes modern views on the problem of asymptomatic BCA atherosclerosis and considers the possibilities of identifying risk groups among the patients with asymptomatic atherosclerosis of the BCA.
