OBJECTIVE  to study the efficacy of the GABA-ergic drug pantogam active (D-, L-gopantenic acid) in patients with schizophrenia treated with typical neuroleptics and to assess the rate of treatment response and tolerability of the drug.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A sample consisted of 70 patients with schizophrenia stratified into main (n=35) and control (n=35) groups.  All patients received one of typical antipsychotics (haloperidol, zuclopenthixol, promazine or perphenazine).
Patients of the main group received in addition pantogam active in dose of 1200-1800 mg daily.  The maximum allowed dose of 1800 mg daily was used in 62.9% of the patients.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The long-term combined therapy with the addition of D-, L-gopantenic acid (pantogam activ) allowed to achieve clinical improvement earlier (on 8th week in the main group versus 16th week in the control group).
The frequency and severity of secondary negative symptoms associated with antipsychotic therapy were decreased as well.
The high efficacy and tolerability of the combined therapy allow to improve quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and their compliance to treatment as well as to reduce costs of medical care.
