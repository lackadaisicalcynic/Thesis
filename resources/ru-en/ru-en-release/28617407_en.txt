[Efficiency of cephalometry in orthodontic treatment planning: cephalometric parameters and their age-related changes].
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of cephalometry in orthodontic treatment planning in patients with teeth crowding and Angle Class I molars relation.  Cephalometric parameters were analyzed in 70 patients that completed orthodontic treatment in 'Orthodont' dental clinic (Samara).
Cephalometric X-rays were taken at baseline examination and after treatment.  In patients with crowding and Class I molars relationship treated with extraction of all four first premolars correlation between N-Se and mandibular and maxillary length was disturbed.
These patients showed higher N-Se and reduced jaws length than patients with no extraction or extraction of 2 premolars.
The observed increase of G angle with reduced mandibular length assumes compensatory changes of mandible position.
These disproportions were aggravated by facial growth.  In certain cases cephalometric assessment is inefficient for treatment strategy choice.
