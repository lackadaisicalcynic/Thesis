[The use of photoneuromodulation in the complex treatment of patients with burning mouth syndrome].  The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of photoneuromodulation in the complex treatment of patients with the burning mouth syndrome (BMS).
Supervised were 120 patients with BMS at the age of 37-79 years (mean age 47.5±5.35 years), which were divided into two groups - the main group and the comparison group (n=60).
All patients with BMS underwent complex treatment that included professional oral hygiene, training in rational oral hygiene and tongue, oral sanitation, rational prosthetics, consultation, treatment and follow-up with a neurologist, general treatment with the appointment of anti-anxiety drugs or antidepressants , vitamins of B group and vascular preparations.
In the main group, after the drug treatment, a photoneuromodulation was performed - the effect of transcranial broadband red light, in the cervical collar zone and in the projection of the pain points of the tongue, the course of treatment was 20 days.
In the comparison group, only medication was prescribed.
The control group consisted of 30 relatively healthy persons at the age of 36±4.7 years without concomitant somatic diseases.
Comparison of the results of the analysis of the level of pain, anxiety and depression, free radical oxidation and the activity of the serum antioxidant system after treatment in the main group and the comparison group indicates that after the complex treatment with the inclusion of the course of photoneuromodulation, the best result was obtained for reducing the level of pain, anxiety and depression, intensity of oxidative processes and increase of activity of the general antioxidant system of protection of blood serum in patients with the burning mouth syndrome.
