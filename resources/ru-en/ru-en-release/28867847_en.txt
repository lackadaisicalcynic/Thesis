Monetary incentives for provision of syphilis screening, Yunnan, China.
PROBLEM  Early detection of syphilis-infected people followed by effective treatment is essential for syphilis prevention and control.
APPROACH
Starting in 2010 the local health authority in Yunnan province, China, developed a network of 670 service sites for syphilis testing, diagnosis and treatment or for testing-only with referral for further diagnosis and treatment.  Point-of-care tests for syphilis and syphilis interventions were integrated into the existing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and control programme.
To improve the syphilis services, a pay-for-performance scheme was introduced in which providers were paid for testing and treating patients.
LOCAL SETTING
Yunnan province is the region hardest hit by HIV infection and disproportionately burdened with syphilis cases in China.
RELEVANT CHANGES
The proportion of attendees at voluntary counselling and testing clinics who were tested for syphilis increased from 46.2% (32 877/71 162) in 2010 to 98.2% (68 012/69 259) in 2015.
Syphilis-infected cases treated with the recommended therapy increased from 26.6% (264/993) in 2010 to 82.5% (453/549) in 2015 at designated testing, diagnosis and treatment sites.
LESSONS LEARNT  The strategy greatly increased the uptake of syphilis testing and treatment among people at risk.
Introduction of point-of-care tests for syphilis increased coverage of the testing services.  Introduction of a pay-for-performance scheme seemed to motivate health-care providers to undertake syphilis intervention services.
