[Modern conception of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and therapeutic strategy].
Here we discuss the pathogenesis of the inflammatory and degenerative nervous system disorders on the example of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis.
Common mechanisms of neurodegeneration in these diseases are reviewed.  The role of neurodegeneration as the main process leading to the resistant disability of patients with multiple sclerosis is discussed.
