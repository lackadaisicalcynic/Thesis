[Anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of emoxipine, reamberin and mexidol in experimental diabetes mellitus].
AIM  To perform a comparative study of anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of derivatives of 3-oxypyridine and succinic acid (emoxipine, reamberin and mexidol) in experimental diabetes mellitus.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
An effect of emoxipine, reamberin and mexidol on manifestations of anxiety in 'elevated plus maze' (EPM) and duration of 'desperate behavior' (DB) in Porsolt test in rats with alloxan diabetes during medication course was studied.
Alpha-lipoic (thioctic) acid (α-LA) was used as a reference drug.
In additional experimental series, an effect of emoxipine, reamberin, mexidol and α-LA on the intensity of hyperglycemia in experimental DM was investigated.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
All studied medications used in doses equivalent to therapeutic range in humans and administered for 14 days significantly reduced manifestations of anxiety and depression in rats with alloxan diabetes.  The most pronounced anxiolytic potential was demonstrated for emoxipine that emerged as the only medication in the study that reduced manifestations of anxiety not only in comparison with 'alloxan diabetes-control' groups but also in comparison to 'intact control'.
The intensity of tranquilizing activity of derivatives of 3-oxypyridine and succinic acid was similar to that of α-LA while the thymoanaleptic activity, when the drugs were administered in maximal doses to rats with experimental DM, was higher.
Both emoxipine and mexidol as well as α-LA in all studied doses significantly decreased hyperglycemia in alloxan diabetes.  Reamberin demonstrated only insignificant tendencies of the same trend.
