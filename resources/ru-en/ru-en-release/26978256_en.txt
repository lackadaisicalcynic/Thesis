OBJECTIVE  To perform an experimental psychological study of gender differences in patients with attack-like schizophrenia in the aspect of pathopsychological syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 80 subjects: 40 men and 40 women, aged 18-30 years.  The disease duration was <3 years.
Patients were examined in remission.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The major gender differences are manifested in emotional and personal characteristics and self-concepts related with them, as well in the characteristics of communication.
It can be assumed that these gender differences are due to a more pronounced presence of an affective component in the structure of endogenous disorders in women which slightly softens the manifestation of negative disorders during the endogenous process.
