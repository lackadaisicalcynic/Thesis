[Morphological features of structural organization of cerebellar cortex in old age].  In this science work there were conducted such researches as organometric, histological, immunomorphologic and morphometric of cerebellar cortex of 219 corpses of people (108 man and 111 woman) of young and old age.
A comparative analysis of the parameters of bulb-shaped neurons in these ages revealed decrease of their height and width.  It is found that distance between interval nerve cell bodies of ganglionic layer increases with age that obviously associated with progressing disorganization and death of bulb-shaped neurons.
It is marked an increment in the number of immunopositive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, protide S-100 and vimentin astrocytes in granular layer and molecular layer of cerebellar cortex, and decline in the number of immunopositive for neuron-specific enolase and immunonegative for protide S-100 and vimentin bulb-shaped neurons that can be regarded as manifestation of neurodegeneration.
Using immunohistochemical methods in research allows approaching more differentially to the issues of morphological assessment cerebellar cortex of elderly people and gives an opportunity to receive more objective and full information of postnatal morphogenesis.
