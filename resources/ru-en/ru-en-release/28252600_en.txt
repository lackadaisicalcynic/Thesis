[An effect of ipidacrine (neuromidin) on electroneuromyographic parameters in the conditions of artificial decompression (a clinical/instrumental study)].
AIM
To study an effect of neuromidin on the changes in electroneuromyographic (ENMG) parameters in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome in the conditions of artificial decompression of a forearm.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty-four 64 patients, 46 women and 18 men, mean age 50,7Â±4,5years, matched for disease severity were studied.  The patients were randomized into neuromidin group and control group.
Neuromidin was introduced using subcutaneous local perineural injections.  Characteristics of neuromidin effect on the changes in ENMG parameters of the median nerve were studied in a model of additional artificial decompression of the median nerve.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
There was the significant depression of the nerve function and worsening of ENMG parameters during the additional decompression as well as the aggravation of conduction block along nerve fibers (motor and sensory).
In patients treated with ipidacrine, there was an increase in the amplitude of sensory and (to a less extent) of M-response that indicated the activation of axonal transport and reservation of functioning of the compressed nerve.
