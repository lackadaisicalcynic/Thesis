[Inflammatory markers in schizophrenia in aged].
OBJECTIVE  To identify inflammatory markers in schizophrenia in aged.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The main group included 29 patients with schizophrenia, mean age 72.1 ± 6.9 years.
A comparison group comprised 34 patients with Alzheimer's disease, mean age 73.4 ± 7.9 years.
Seven plasma inflammatory indicators were determined.
RESULTS
There was a significant increase in the activity/content of acute inflammation stage proteins: α1-proteinase inhibitor and C-reactive protein as well as anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 compared to the controls while the activity of other inflammatory molecules (leukocyte elastase, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) was not changed.  No correlations between immunological parameters and clinical presentations were found.
CONCLUSION  The results suggest that inflammation does not play a significant role in the remote stages of schizophrenia, in contrast to earlier stages of the disease, and the activity of the pathological process decreased in the late stages.
These characteristics can reflect the body reactivity in elderly patients.
