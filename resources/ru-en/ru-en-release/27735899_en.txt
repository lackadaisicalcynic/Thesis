[Electroneurographic monitoring during the test of artificial compression as a method of early diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome].
AIM  To develop the algorithm of early diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) at the stage of functional neurological disturbances by expanding diagnostic possibilities of electroneuromyography using artificial compression test.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Parameters of conductivity of the median nerve in 54 patients with finger numbness were analyzed during 3 months before and after compression of the forearm (blood pressure was measured for 1 min).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
An increase in the latency in motor fibers and a decrease in the amplitude of sensory response were identified in patients with CTS signs and normal electroneuromyographical parameters at baseline.
The use of additional electroneuromyographical monitoring during the provocative artificial compression test expands the possibilities of this method and improves early diagnosis of CTS.
