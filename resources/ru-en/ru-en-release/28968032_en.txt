[Epidemiological, clinical and pathogenic features of stroke in elderly and senile age].  A comparative investigation of the epidemiological, clinical and pathogenetic indices of cerebral stroke in 1 153 representatives of different age was conducted.
The predominance in the incidence of strokes among women of elderly and senile age largely is due to higher life expectancy of women compared to men.  A significant number of intracerebral blood effusions in elderly and senile can arise secondarily, after the ischemic focus formation by the type of «red softening».
This, to a certain extent, can be explained by the high frequency of somatic complications of stroke, disorders of consciousness and high mortality among persons older than 60 years compared to younger.
Less positive clinical outcomes of stroke in elderly and senile age even if you increase the length of their stay in hospital may indicate shortcomings in the existing standards of diagnostics and treatment with completely different from that of the young, combination a background of stroke pathology.
