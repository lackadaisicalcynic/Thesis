[Biodegradable fixation systems in pediatric craniofacial surgery: 10-year experience with 324 patients].  INTRODUCTION
Over the past 15 years, resorbable materials have been successfully used for osteosynthesis, but their high cost prevents widespread application.  However, the use of resorbable systems could be a method of choice, especially in treatment of children in the active growth period.
Obviously, biodegradable materials not only are highly competitive with known metal constructs in terms of fixation rigidity, biocompatibility, and a low risk of infection but also have an undeniable advantage, such as gradual resorption allowing quick return of damaged bones to the physiological conditions of functioning.
A special feature of bioresorbable systems is that they can be assembled using ultrasonic welding, which greatly facilitates the fixation process and also provides necessary rigidity, even in cases of joining very thin bones when reliable fixation with screws is impossible.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Over the past 10 years, we have used biodegradable systems in 324 patients.
In 244 of them, we used traditional (plate/screw) systems; in 80 cases, an ultrasonic welding system was chosen for osteosynthesis.
RESULTS
In the present work, we discuss, based on clinical evidence, the advantages and disadvantages of both fixation systems for reconstructive craniofacial surgery in children.
