The role of drug vendors in improving basic health-care services in Nigeria.
OBJECTIVE  To characterize patent and proprietary medicine vendors and shops in Nigeria and to assess their ability to help improve access to high-quality, primary health-care services.
METHODS
In 2013 and 2014, a census of patent and proprietary medicine shops in 16 states of Nigeria was carried out to determine: (i) the size and coverage of the sector; (ii) the basic characteristics of shops and their staff; and (iii) the range of products stocked for priority health services, particularly for malaria, diarrhoea and family planning.
The influence of the medical training of people in charge of the shops on the health-care products stocked and registration with official bodies was assessed by regression analysis.
FINDINGS
The number of shops per 100,000 population was higher in southern than in northern states, but the average percentage of people in charge with medical training across local government areas was higher in northern states: 52.6% versus 29.7% in southern states.
Shops headed by a person with medical training were significantly more likely to stock artemisinin-based combination therapy, oral rehydration salts, zinc, injectable contraceptives and intrauterine contraceptive devices.
However, these shops were less likely to be registered with the National Association of Patent and Proprietary Medicine Dealers and more likely to be registered with the regulatory body, the Pharmacist Council of Nigeria.  CONCLUSION
Many patent and proprietary medicine vendors in Nigeria were medically trained.  With additional training and oversight, they could help improve access to basic health-care services.
Specifically, vendors with medical training could participate in task-shifting interventions.
