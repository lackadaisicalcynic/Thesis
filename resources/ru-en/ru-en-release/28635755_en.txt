[Characteristics of structural and functional organization of the brain].
Current conceptions on the fundamental mechanisms underlying brain functioning in normal conditions and pathological states are considered.
The author emphasizes that a great progress in the field has been achieved after the implementation of neuroimaging methods in clinical practice.
During the last time, attention is drawn to the connections between separate neurons as well as between different brain regions.
Functional specialization and functional integration of different brain regions are key concepts of the higher brain function organization.
The significance of the resting state of the brain, which is in fact the active process, is analyzed.  The state of cerebral functions determines internal processes in the neuronal tissue.
Different aspects of energy metabolism determining the normal functioning of cerebral structures are considered.  The expediency of using the drugs influencing the energy metabolism, one of which is 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate (mexidol), is highlighted.
