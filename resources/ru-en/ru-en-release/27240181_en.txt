[The efficacy of benzodiazepines and low-potent antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy of somatoform disorders].
OBJECTIVE
To assess the efficacy of monotherapy with sertraline or its combinations with phenazepam or thioridazine in patients with somatoform disorders.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The open study included 65 patients divided into three groups according to the drug used.  Clinical condition of the patients was evaluated with CGI and Hamilton scale.
The Screening for Somatoform Symptoms 7 was administered as well.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
During the treatment, a significant decrease in the severity of somatoform disorders was observed in all groups.  The more rapid development of therapeutic effect, including the reduction in anxiety symptoms in the sertraline + phenazepam group, was found.
There were no significant differences between the sertraline group and the sertraline+ thioridazine group.  The differences were identified only during three weeks of treatment while there were no between-group differences in the 4th week.
In accordance to these results, the duration of adjunctive therapy with benzodiazepines should be limited in time.
