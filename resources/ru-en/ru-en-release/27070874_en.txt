[Simultaneous abdominal and retroperitoneal surgery].  AIM  To study the results of simultaneous abdominal and retroperitoneal interventions.  MATERIAL AND METHODS  The article presents analysis of 856 simultaneous operations whose proportion was 3.49% of total number of operations.
Most of them was performed via videolaparoscopic approach (697, 81.4%), open access and mini-laparotomy were used rarer (111, 12.9%) and 48 (6,7%) respectively).
Severity of great number of interventions corresponded to degree I and II of D. Lochlein and R. Pichlmayer classification.
Modern diagnostic methods including sonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, endoscopy and laboratory data were used to define diagnosis.
RESULTS
Simultaneous approach increases duration of surgery 30.3% on the average that is significant risk factor in case of surgery of severity degree III and videolaparoscopic interventions.
Simultaneous surgery does not significantly increase ICU-stay and incidence of postoperative complications.
