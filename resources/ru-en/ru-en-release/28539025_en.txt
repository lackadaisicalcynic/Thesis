[Molecular aspects of vasoprotective peptide KED activity during atherosclerosis and restenosis].  Peptide KED (Lys-Glu-Asp) has vasoprotective effects and is effective substance in treatment of of atherosclerosis and other cardio-vascular disorders in elderly people.
One of the probable mechanisms of biological activity of this peptide is epigenetic genes regulation.  These genes can coding proteins, which are markers of endothelium functional activity.
The goal of investigation was to study the KED peptide effect on signal molecules expression in normal, atherosclerotic and restenotic endothelium in vitro.
It was shown, that KED peptide has normalized endothelin-1 expression, which increased during atherosclerosis and restenosis.  KED peptide also restorates cells interactions by connexin expression.
Geroprotective effect of KED peptide is realized by increasing of sirtuin1 expression, which has took part in DNA reparation.
