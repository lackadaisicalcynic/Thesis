[Proximal clipping of a large fusiform aneurysm of the A2 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery with awakening of the patient (a case report and literature review)].
Arterial aneurysms of the A2 segment are very rare (<1%) peripheral aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory.
Usually, these are saccular aneurysms; there are single reports of fusiform aneurysms of this location.
Surgical treatment of these aneurysms involves both microsurgical and endovascular interventions.  In the presented case, we used deconstructive surgery (proximal clipping of the aneurysm) with intraoperative awakening of the patient, which verified sufficient collateral blood flow.
In the case of focal deficit development, we planned to simultaneously perform an interarterial anastomosis between the A3 segments of the right and left ACAs.
