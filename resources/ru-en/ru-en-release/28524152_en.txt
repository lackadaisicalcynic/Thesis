[Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration].  Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in older patients.
An important role in angiogenesis is played by regulatory mechanisms (an increase in the number of proliferating endothelial and stromal cells and morphological alterations in the vascular network) induced by factors from the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family.  Since 2006, the key treatment of neovascular AMD includes agents that inhibit the activity of VEGF.
This review covers the effectiveness and safety of the use of anti-VEGF agents in neovascular AMD patients.
A comparison is drawn between monoclonal antibody-based therapy and a new drug from the VEGF-Trap group.
