[The geriatric status in patients with the breast cancer in the conditions of comorbidity.]
The article represents the results of a comparative analysis of the geriatric status, the Charlson comorbidity index and the geriatric variant of the cumulative illness rating scale for geriatrics (CIRS-G) in patients of different age groups with breast cancer, considering the concomitant pathology (CHF).
It was revealed that the age classification of the WHO is more valid in determining the somatic and geriatric status of women with breast cancer.  Also the evaluation of the severity of geriatric syndromes is given.
It was revealed that the malnutrition syndrome and cognitive impairment syndrome are more expressed in people of middle age and elderly with breast cancer As well the importance of detecting both frailty and comorbidity is determined with the aim of increasing the accuracy of prediction of adverse events of treatment.
