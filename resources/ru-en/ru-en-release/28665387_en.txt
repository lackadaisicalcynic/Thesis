[Treatment of syringomyelia associated with adhesive arachnoiditis].  The prevalence of syringomyelia (SM) caused by adhesive arachnoiditis (AA) is 2 to 4 cases per 100000 population.
Surgical treatment of this pathology usually includes implantation of shunts into the cyst cavity or opening and drainage of the cavity.  In this case, SM continues to progress in 72-100% of patients.
Unsatisfactory outcomes of this surgical approach necessitate searching for other treatment options.
PURPOSE  To define the optimal amount of surgery for SM associated with AA and the criteria for assessment of surgery outcomes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The authors treated 47 SM patients in the period from 2010 to 2015.
Of these, 34 (72.3%) patients underwent surgery; a total of 40 operations were performed.
The patients' age ranged from 18 to 64 years (mean, 43.5 years).
Tethering of the spinal cord was eliminated in 25 patients; 9 patients underwent cyst shunting.
RESULTS
Among operated patients, 5 patients had grade 1 arachnopathy, 13 patients had grade 2 arachnopathy, 12 patients had grade 3 arachnopathy, and 4 patients had grade 4 arachnopathy.
The minimal postoperative follow-up period was 11 months.
After shunting, the condition improved in 8 of 9 patients; in 7 patients, the condition returned to the baseline level within the first postoperative year; in 6 (66.7%) of these patients, the disease continued to progress.
After surgical release of spinal cord tethering, satisfactory long-term results were achieved in 13 (86.6%) patients with grade 1-2 arachnopathy.
In 3 (50%) patients with grade 3 arachnopathy, the condition was stabilized.
Among patients with grade 4 arachnopathy, progression of the disease was stopped in 1 patient; the condition worsened in 2 (50%) patients.
Among all the operated patients, complications developed in 7 patients.
There were no lethal outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
In grade 1-2 arachnopathy, progression of SM after release of spinal cord tethering occurs only in 13.4% of patients.  Therefore, release of spinal cord tethering is recommended for these patients.
In grade 3-4 arachnopathy, the rate of relapse after this surgery is more than 80%.
Therefore, given the simplicity and a lower risk of complications of cyst shunting, this procedure is advisable for these patients.
