[Replantation of mandibular head using NiTi-based fixing elements].  The article presents clinical observations of 49 patients with high condylar fractures, tumors and tumor-like lesions of the mandible where as the primary treatment method or as an adjunct to endoprosthetics after mandibular resection replantation of the mandibular head was performed using NiTi shape memory appliances to fix the fragments and isolate the replant from the glenoid fossa.
Treatment results proved high efficiency of the technology.
