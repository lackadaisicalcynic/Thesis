[Association between pathological olfaction, immunological abnormalities and predisposition to substance use].
OBJECTIVE  To reveal olfactory parameters of substance addiction formation through evaluation of predictive capability of olfactometry combined with laboratory-immunological methods.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 156 people of both sexes aged 18-25 years.  Three comparison groups with different attitudes towards psychoactive substances were formed as follows: people who do not use psychoactive substances (controls), episodic consumers (group at risk) and people with dependence syndrome.
The occurrence of olfactory abnormalities in the anamnesis has immunological, psychological and behavioral correlates and is associated with earlier age of onset of substance consumption.  The severity of aversive reactions to the test odorant is reduced already in the stage of episodic substance use and is associated with clinical signs of immune deficiency, suppression of cellular immunity and an increase in blood cortisol levels in substance abusers.
CONCLUSION
Diagnostic and predictive modeling in the field of biological and clinical science of drug addiction is possible based on immunological and olfactory parameters.
