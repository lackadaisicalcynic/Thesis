[Comparative evaluation of clinical and economic efficiency of paliperidone in various dosage forms used in patients with schizophrenia].
AIM
To evaluate clinical and economic efficacy of schizophrenia treatment with three forms of paliperidone (peroral form, intramuscular injections once a month and once in three month).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Pharmacoeconomic analysis based on the results of earlier foreign randomized clinical studies on paliperidone in treatment of schizophrenia was carried out.
Indirect comparison of different medication forms of paliperidone compared to placebo was performed.
The analysis of costs was based on a Markov model built for the study.  Two categories of costs: costs of pharmacological treatment with paliperidone and costs of disease exacerbation due to the violation of treatment regimen were considered.
To assess pharmacoeconomic efficacy of paliperidone, a cost-benefit analysis with calculation of cost utility ratio (CUR) and incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) was used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
In view of the influence on the budget, all forms of paliperidone have similar pharmacoeconomic efficacy with the advantage of prolonged release injectable (depot) forms that increase patient's adherence to treatment.
As a result, CUR of injectable forms was lower compared to that of the peroral form by 11,1 and 46,3% of month and 3-month forms, respectively.
ICUR for paliperidone used once in 3 month (trevicta) was more effective compared to paliperidone used monthly (xeplion).
It has been concluded that paliperidone for prolonged release injections used once in 3 month is most pharmacoeconomically effective.
