[Influence of multimodal effect of cytoflavin in the acute brain stroke in patients with metabolic syndrome].  We present the results of a multicenter study on efficacy of cytoflavin in the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke.
One hundred and twenty patients (60 of main group and 60 of control group) were enrolled in the study.  All patients received basic therapy aimed at to improve systemic hemodynamics.
Rheological blood properties and to prevent stroke complications.
Patients of main group were treated with cytoflavin as follows: 1-10 days -20 ml (in200 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution) twice a day intravenously in groups: 11-35 days -850 mg twice a day.
We assessed dynamics of restoration of lost functions (NIHSS, Rankin scale, Barthel index) and volume of ischemic lesion (KT, diffusion-weighted image).
We reveled a trend towards effect of cytoflavin on the preservations of brain mater in acute phase of stroke.  Cytoflavin reduced neurological deficit and improved activities of daily living in patients that may be explained by less brain damage.
