[Cardiac rhythm disturbances in the children with hearing pathology].  The aim of the study was to identify cardiac arrhythmias in children presenting with hearing impairments.
Hearing loss in the children can occur concurrently with the disturbances of the cardiac rhythms.  The detection of this pathology at the diagnostic stage is as important as it is at the stage of rehabilitation including surgical one.
RESULTS  Cardiac arrhythmias and conduction were recorded on the electrocardiograms obtained from 10 patients (4 boys and 6 girls) of the 100 examined ones, which amounted to 10%.
The hereditary long QT syndrome (including Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome) has not been identified.  CONCLUSION
The timely diagnostics of congenital arrhythmias in the children with hearing impairment makes it possible to significantly reduce the risk of the sudden cardiac death (for example, in the patients presenting with the Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome) and facilitates the choice of the anesthesiological support for the surgical treatment (including cochlear implantation) taking into consideration possible cardiac rhythm disturbances.
