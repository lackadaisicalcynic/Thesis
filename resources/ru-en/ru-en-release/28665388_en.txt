[Posterior decompression of the craniovertebral junction in syringomyelia combined with Chiari-1 malformation in children].
OBJECTIVE
to develop the algorithm for defining the amount of posterior decompression of the craniovertebral junction in children with syringomyelia combined with Chiari-1 malformation.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty eight children with syringomyelia and Chiari-1 malformation, under age of 18 years, underwent posterior decompression of the craniovertebral junction (PDCVJ) in the period from January 2001 to June 2016.  Seven (10%) patients underwent extradural decompression (EDD), 16 (24%) patients underwent extra-arachnoid duraplasty (EAD), 25 (37%) patients underwent intra-arachnoid dissection (IAD) and duraplasty, and 20 (29%) patients underwent PDCVJ and placement of a fourth ventricle-subarachnoid shunt.
RESULTS
Clinical improvement occurred in 85% of patients, and stabilization was observed in 11% of patients.  Syringomyelia regressed in 78% of cases.
There were no complications associated with EDD; however, re-operation was required in 3 (43%) cases.
In the case of EAD, treatment results were satisfactory in 11 (79%) patients; re-operation was required in 2 (12.5%) cases; there were no complications in the early postoperative period.
The highest complication rate of 6 (30%) cases was associated with shunt placement and duraplasty.
However, long-term results in this group of patients were satisfactory in 16 (94%) cases, and MRI-based positive changes were observed in 100% of cases.
CONCLUSION
According to our analysis, EAD is the method of choice for PDCVJ in children with syringomyelia and Chiari-1 malformation without myelopathy symptoms.
In the presence of myelopathy symptoms, intra-arachnoid dissection (with or without shunting) is an acceptable alternative.
To our opinion, the use of EDD in syringomyelia is unadvisable.
