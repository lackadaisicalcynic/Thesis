[Mini-invasive technologies in complex treatment of esophagus cancer].  It was evaluated mini-invasive endovideosurgical technologies using in complex treatment of esophagus cancer.
The investigation included 28 patients with thoracic esophagus cancer.  Age of patients operated in terms from April 2012 to December 2013 was from 42 to 74 years (mean 61.7 Â± 8.7 years).
Only surgical treatment was used in 10 patients.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy were performed in 18 patients.
Hybrid mini-invasive esophagectomy (laparoscopic stomach mobilization and right-side thoracotomy) were used in 14 cases.
The frequency of postoperative complications was 35.5%.
Mini-invasive endovideosurgical esophagectomy was done in 14 patients.
The frequency of postoperative complications was 57.1%.
There were not deaths.
Our experience demonstrates good results of mini-invasive technologies using in treatment of patients with esophagus cancer.
Endovideosurgical methods permit to perform adequate volume of surgery in case of oncological diseases.
