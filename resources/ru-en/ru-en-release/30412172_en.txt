[The microbiocenosis of the palatal tonsils in the practically healthy people].  The objective of the present study was the investigation of the quantitative and qualitative composition of the cultured microorganisms isolated from the proximal parts of the palatal tonsil lacunes of the practically healthy people.
The data obtained made it possible to characterize the microbiocenosis of the palatal tonsil lacunes in the practically healthy subjects at the age from 18 to 30 years.
A total of 153 strains were identified with the use of mass spectrometry; they represent six genera of two phylotypes that occur in the form of associations comprised of 4-5 microorganisms with the predominance of the species of the genus Streptococcus.
The results of the study expand our knowledge about the oropharyngeal microbiota and create the prerequisites for the better uundderstanding of the contribution of the microbiotic communities to the development of pathology of the upper respiratory tracts.
