[The use of Foley catheter in reconstructive procedures involving the middle third of the facial skeleton].  The aim of this study was to improve the efficiency of surgical treatment of patients with fractures involving zygomatico-orbital complex and maxillary sinus through the use of Foley catheter. 352 patients with fractures of the middle third of the facial skeleton were treated at the Departments of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery in Novokuznetsk Institute and I.M. Sechenov First MSMU.
All patients underwent open reduction and osteosynthesis using extramedullary titanium mini-plates and NiTi mini-clamps.
In the cases with large bone defects additional reconstructive techniques were used such as replantation of bone fragments and endoprosthesis with NiTi implants.
For the purpose of drainage and retention Foley catheter was placed in the cavity of the maxillary sinus after the surgical procedure.  We obtained good and satisfactory results in the majority of clinical cases.
The use of Foley catheter was found to be very effective for the post-operative drainage and hemostasis of the maxillary sinus and in cases involving the use of fixation implant in the reconstructive surgeries in the middle third of the face.
