[Manual therapy in non-specific neck pain].
AIM  To investigate the effectiveness of manual therapy (MT) in patients with nonspecific neck pain (NNP).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ninety two patients with NNP, aged from 18 to 60 years (41,1±10,2 years), 64 (69,6%) women, 28 (30,4%) men, were examined.
Treatment duration was 3 weeks with 6 sessions (2 sessions per week).  The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated by measuring the decrease of pain intensity, improvement of daily activity, and patient-related recovery measured with the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and the 7-point Global Perceived Effect scale (GPE).
Size effect was assessed using Cohen's d.
RESULTS
In the end of treatment, pain was reduced by 3,4±2,3 points (from 4,5±2,5 to 1,1±1,0 points; Cohen's d 1,98); disability was improved by 9,5±5,0 points (from 15,2±5,6 to 5,8±4,0 points; Cohen's d 1,97); patients assessed mean global improvement as «improved» and «much improved» (the improvement by 2-3 points on GPE scale).
CONCLUSION
MT in NNP is effective method of treatment that decreases pain syndrome, improves daily activity and is positively assessed by the patients.
