[The set of International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health categories for the study of the effectiveness of rehabilitation of breast cancer patients with the main late complications of the surgical treatment].  The author selected the set of ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) categories selected for breast cancer patients presenting with the major late complications of the surgical treatment, such as upper limp lymphedema, pain syndrome, and mobility limitation in the shoulder joint on the side of the intervention.
The problems associated with each component of ICF are described including the body functions - 26 categories, body structures - 15, activities and participation - 49, environmental factors - 31 categories.
The author's original classifications are adapted to the ICF terminology.
The criteria for estimating the determinants of the structure of spinal nerves, lymph nodes and vessels, veins, the mammary gland, upper extremities, muscles of the trunk, the skin and the related structures have been developed.
All the changes in the body functions are described and the methods are proposed for the evaluation of the determinants or the mental and sensory functions, the cardiovascular, immune and respiratory systems, neuromuscular and skeletal functions, the functions of the skin and the related structures.
The principles of coding for the components of activity and participation are illustrated (general tasks and requirements, mobility, self-service, everyday life, interpersonal interactions and relationships, main spheres of life, community life, social and civil life) and the environmental factors.
The coding is presented in the form of detailed and readily intelligible tables with the explanatory remarks.
