[Differences in the cytocompatibility of bone-plastic materials from xenogeneic hydroxyapatite with stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells].  AIM  To compare the cytocompatibility of osteoplastic materials used in dentistry with stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSC).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Materials of the brands 'Bio-Oss', 'Indost', 'Bioplast', 'Viscoll' and 'Trikafor' were selected for study purposes.
Cultures of SHED and AD-MSC were used for testing.
The cytotoxic effect of the materials was determined using MTT test and vital staining with trypan blue.
Cell adhesion was assessed by the vital staining of PKH-26.
RESULTS
Water extracts of bone-plastic materials from xenogeneic hydroxyapatite of the brands 'Bio-Oss', 'Indost' and 'Bioplast' exert a cytotoxic effect on SHED and do not cause the death of AD-MSC.
Materials based on collagen and Î²-tricalcium phosphate possess high cytocompatibility with all cell cultures under study.
CONCLUSION
From the point of cytocompatibility all the examined bone-plastic materials may be considered safe for the restoration of bone defects.
It should be noted that SHED transplantation on the surface of materials containing xenogeneic hydroxypatite is unacceptable.
