AIM  to evaluate ocular hemodynamics and informativity of estimated individual normal range of intraocular pressure (IOP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of 12 patients (22 eyes) with carotid artery malfunction were examined.
Ocular blood flow (OBF) and IOP were measured with Ocular Blood Flow Analyzer.
Actual OBF was then compared with what is considered normal for a given axial length (AL).
Individual normal range of IOP was calculated according to an original formula (described in previous publications).
Doppler imaging of ocular vessels enabled blood flow velocity measurement.
Morphological parameters and functional status of the retina and optic nerve were judged on automated perimetry (Octopus 900) and optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT) findings.
Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 10 software.
RESULTS
Generally, OBF showed no correlation with the grade of carotid artery stenosis (p < 0.05), however, was significantly reduced as compared to its AL-dependent norm in patients with greater than 85% narrowing of the internal carotid artery, which can cause misestimating of their individual normal range of IOP.
A negative relationship was established between the blood flow velocity in short posterior ciliary arteries and the grade of internal carotid artery stenosis (p < 0.005).
Ocular blood flow deficit relative to the AL-dependent norm correlated with ophthalmic artery resistance index.
CONCLUSION
OBF-based estimation of individual normal range of IOP is inexpedient in patients with greater than 80% carotid artery stenosis due to its possible influence on ocular hemodynamics.
In most cases of less than 80% carotid artery stenosis OBF is adequate or slightly reduced as compared to its AL-dependent norm and thus, has no significant impact on estimated individual normal range of IOP.
