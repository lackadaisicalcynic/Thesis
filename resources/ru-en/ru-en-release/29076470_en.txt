OBJECTIVE  to determine the efficacy of unilateral posteroventral pallidotomy (PVP) in the treatment of drug-induced dyskinesia (DID) in Parkinson's disease (PD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We analyzed surgical treatment of 14 patients with PD complicated by DID who underwent unilateral PVP at the Research Center of Neurology in the period between 2012 and 2015.
The clinical type of DID was mainly represented by peak-dose choreoathetoid dyskinesia, more pronounced in the distal limbs, and predominantly unilateral.
The severity of drug-induced dyskinesia was assessed on the UPDRS scale (part IV-A) before surgery and at 1 week and 6 months after surgery.
RESULTS
One week after pallidotomy, all of the 14 patients had a regression of contralateral dyskinesia by 68.3±9.7%; 50% of patients had a regression of ipsilateral dyskinesias by 43%, on average.
In 50% of cases, the dose of levodopa was reduced by 15%, on average.
On examination at 6 months after surgery, regression of contralateral dyskinesia was 55.7±8.8%, and the severity of ipsilateral DID returned to the preoperative level.
The use of pallidotomy significantly improved the indicators of daily activity and quality of life of patients.
There were no significant postoperative complications.
Three patients had mild speech disorders in the form of dysarthria, which regressed 2-3 weeks after surgery.
