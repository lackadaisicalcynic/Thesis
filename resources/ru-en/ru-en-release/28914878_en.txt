[Pineal cyst].  A pineal cyst (PC) is a benign neoplasm in the pineal region, or more precisely in the pineal body.
Most cysts are incidental findings and are not associated with symptoms typical of patients seeking medical advice.
Symptomatic cysts are discovered less often and, depending on the clinical picture, require different treatment approaches.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We analyzed the literature data about the clinical picture, diagnosis, and treatment of PCs for more than a century (1914-2016).
CONCLUSION
To date, there is no single approach for managing PC patients.
The indications for surgical treatment of symptomatic PCs are still not fully defined.
It remains unclear which PC cases should be followed-up, and how often control examinations should be performed.
More research of PCs is needed to develop new approaches to treatment of PC patients.
