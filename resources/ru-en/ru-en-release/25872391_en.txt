[A case of bilateral cystoid macular edema (Irvine-Gass) after bilateral multifocal intraocular lens implantation].
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate clinical outcomes of cystoid macular edema (CME) developed after phacoemulsification with multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The article reports a favorable outcome of bilateral CME in a 66-year-old after bilateral phacoemulsification with Rayner M-flex Multifocal IOLs implantation.
Optical coherent tomography (OCT) and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) were used for follow-up.  RESULTS
In the first eye CME developed 3 weeks after the surgery and required 1.5 years of treatment.
In the fellow eye CME manifested 2 weeks after the surgery and resolved in six months under the treatment.  The follow-up period was 5 and 2 years correspondingly.
CONCLUSION
It is shown that retinal OCT is useful for distinguishing clinical forms of CME and is able to confirm positive effects of the treatment, whereas mfERG provides the opportunity to assess subtle mechanisms of retinal function recovery, which may take several years.
