[The effect of cytokine therapy on the results of surgical treatment of patients with acute ulcerative gastroduodenal bleeding].
AIM
To improve the results of surgical treatment of patients with acute ulcerative gastroduodenal bleeding using immune correction with β-leukin.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Urgent and elective operations were performed in 120 patients with gastroduodenal ulcers.  Patients of the main group (n=63) received systemic cytokine therapy with β-leukin in addition to conventional treatment.
Pre- and postoperative immune correction was absent in the comparison group.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  There was preoperative imbalance of antiphlogistic and proinflammatory cytokines in comparison group.
Severity of this process depended on blood loss.  Therapy with interleukin decreased severity of cytokine imbalance.
