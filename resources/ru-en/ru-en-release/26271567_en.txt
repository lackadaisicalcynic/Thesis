[Treatment of diffuse peritonitis in children].
THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
Improving the treatment of advanced peritonitis via use in therapy antihypoxant Reamberin and hepatoprotector Remaxol, nutritional support, sanitation laparoscopic abdominal cavity.  SUBJECTS
A total of 232 children aged 1 to 15 years with generalized purulent peritonitis treated at the children's surgical departments of Samara from 2001 to 2014.
A study group comprised 148 patients who used the optimized pathogenetic therapy.  In the study group was allocated two groups: 64 patients in the pathogenetic therapy that used antihypoxant reamberin, and 84 children in the treatment of which reamberin and hepatoprotector remaxol.
All the children of the main group received nutritional support (trophic feedings), used in the surgical treatment of abdominal laparoscopic sanitation.
Comprehensive survey includes the study of the dynamics of the level of white blood cells, leukocyte index on Kalf-Caliph, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, temperature, total albumin concentration, transaminase levels.
RESULTS  Comparison of the studied parameters in the study and control groups, showed a more rapid decrease in the symptoms and signs of intoxication (leukocytosis, LII, body temperature), relief of enteric disease, recovery of protein-synthetic function of the liver, a decrease of cytolytic and mesenchymal-inflammatory syndrome in the study group, especially in the subgroup in which therapy was included remaxol.
CONCLUSIONS
Optimization of treatment involving the application of the combined drugs--antihypoxant reamberin, hepatoprotector remaxol, nutritional support and implementation of laparoscopic abdominal sanitation led to improved results of therapy common purulent peritonitis in children.
