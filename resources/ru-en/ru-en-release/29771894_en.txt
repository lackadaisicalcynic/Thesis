[Axial ametropias of very high degree].  To characterize a complex of disorders developing in patients with extreme values of anteroposterior axis of the eye, it is necessary to create an appropriate nomenclature.
As a topic for discussion, authors suggest to supplement the existing classifications of myopia and hyperopia with 'character of ametropia' section (axial, refractive, mixed) and the definition of ametropias of very high (ultra-high/extreme) degree (a criterion for myopia is: <-10 D).
In prospect, classification of such ametropias should be based on the length of the anteroposterior axis of the eye.
