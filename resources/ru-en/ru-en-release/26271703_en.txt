BACKGROUND  Teeth changes after chemotherapy are of clinical importance, but no morphological studies were conducted on microscopic level.
AIM  To assess morphological changes in teeth developing under chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS  Twenty-nine adolescents aged 13-16 years that received chemotherapy at the age of 2-13 were included in the study.
Teeth morphology was evaluated by means of clinical and radiological data as well as microscopy of extracted teeth (n=13).  Thirty healthy children aged 13-16 and 8 teeth extracted for orthodontic reasons served as a control.
RESULTS  Chemotherapy has arresting impact on teeth development confirmed by aplasia of germs when influenced on stages I-II (p=0.0001), preliminary apexogenesis resulting in shortened roots in teeth at the later stages of growth and development (p=0.01).
Enamel and dentine defects usually located in cervical area are also a specific feature, while caries incidence was not higher when compared to control group.
CONCLUSION
Children receiving chemotherapy have high risk of secondary teeth loss because of germs aplasia and extraction of severely decayed teeth.
Early diagnostics helps to prevent secondary deformations of dental arches by prompt prosthetic rehabilitation.  Root morphology changes should be considered by root canal treatment.
