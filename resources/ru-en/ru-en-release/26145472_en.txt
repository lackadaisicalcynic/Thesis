[Anatomical rationale for elevating revascularized ulnar forearm fasciocutaneous flap for head and neck reconstruction].
In this paper we studied in detail features of the blood supply to the tissues of the forearm of the pools ulnar and radial arteries, the technique of line access and the formation of skin-fascial ulnar flap by using a layered dissection with contrast vessels on non fixed human cadavers.
Blood supply of the forearm carried out by branches radial and ulnar arteries, which allows to create in this area radial flap and ulnar flap loo.
The size of the skin-fascial ulnar flap can reach 3-10 cm in length, 2-6 cm in width, the length of vessel pedicle of the transplant can reach 12 cm.
The research studied the characteristics of blood supply of the forearm and the comparative evaluation of tissue perfusion of the radial and ulnar arteries; proved localization forming ulnar flap.
Studies have shown that revascularised skin-fascial ulnar flap may be can be an alternative donor material for elimination of soft tissue defects with less traumatization donor area and reduce upper limb function compared with radial flap.
