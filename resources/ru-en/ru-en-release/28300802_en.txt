[Evaluation of a method based on the principle of CI therapy in the correction of walking function in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis syndrome].
AIM  To develop a new, effective, affordable method of neurorehabilitation for the correction of walking functions based on the principle of CI (constraint-induced movement therapy) therapy in patients with the syndrome of hemiparesis of post-stroke origin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 100 patients with moderate to marked syndrome of central hemiparesis in the recovery period of stroke.  Patients were randomized into two groups.
In the main group, the walk recovery was carried out using CI-therapy in complex with traditional methods of neurorehabilitation and in the comparison group, walk correction was performed by generally accepted methods of kinesiotherapy and physical therapy.
Both groups were comparable by stage of stroke, the severity of paresis, age.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The risk of fall significantly decreased in both groups of patients.  The length and paretic step time significantly decreased in the main group.
The effectiveness of the restoration of the function of walking was higher in the main group that allows us to recommend the method of correction of the walk based on the principle of CI therapy in the complex neurorehabilitation.
