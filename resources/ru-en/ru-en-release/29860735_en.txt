[Influence of bone marrow autotransplantation on neurotransmitter structures of appendix vermiformis in old rats.]
The influence of bone marrow autotransplantation on neurotransmitter structures of appendix vermiformis was studied.  The study revealed that an increase in the number of neurotransmitter structures (mast and granular luminescent cells), having a high content of catecholamines and serotonin was noted in old rats in 40 min after bone marrow autotransplantation.
In the center of vermiformis appendix lymphoid nodes reproduction cellular programmed differentiations having a high content of neuroamines are determined.
In 2 hours after bone marrow autotransplantation their number decreases, the content of catecholamines and serotonin reduces as well.
In the immunohistochemical reaction increase in proliferative activity of cells both in proper t. mucosa plate crypts and appendix vermiformis lymphoid nodules is observed up to 40 min of experiment.
In 2 hours Ki-67 positive cells reduce both in t. mucosa and t. s/mucosa of appendix vermiformis.
