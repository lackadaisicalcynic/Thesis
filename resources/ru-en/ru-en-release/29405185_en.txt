[The peculiar morphological features of the surface relief of the major local ruptures of the liver in the case of a blunt injury].  The objective of the present study was the comprehensive investigation of morphogenesis of the surface relief of the major local ruptures of the liver in the case of a blunt injury and the obtaining of an additional information on the possibility to use these data for the purposes of forensic medical expertise.
We explored the reliefs of the major local ruptures of the liver in the cases of a single fatal blunt injury inflicted in a traffic accident, by kicking or a powerful stroke with the fist.
In addition, the threshold hepatic lesions depending on their severity were determined experimentally.  The model allowing to describe the qualitative relief alterations of the rupture surface associated with a blunt injury has been developed.
The main elements of the surface relief of the major ruptures include avulsion and shear ridges, folds as well as 'extension zones'.  Three types of possible rupture surface reliefs have been identified, viz. relatively uniform, stratified and fragmented non-uniform ones.
Such reliefs are formed in the case of a threshold injury, powerful stroke with the leg or the fist, and road traffic accident, respectively.
The location of the shear ridges at the ruptured surface makes it possible to determine the direction of growth of the local major rupture and of the stroke vector.
The presence of multiple 'extension zones' at the surface of the local major rupture may serve as an indicator either of the influence of the unlimited traumatic surface or of the very strong stroke.
The above features of the relief of the rupture surface provide the conditions for the application of the statistical approach to the elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the deformation and the destruction of the parenchymatous organs suffering a blunt injury.
