[Annual blood pressure dynamics and weather sensitivity in women].
AIM  To study the annual cycle of blood pressure (BP) and weather sensitivity in normotensive women aged 20-59 years.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The same group of 25 non-smoking women who had been living in the European North of Russia (62° N, 51° E) almost since their birth and were engaged in moderate-intensity mental labor was daily examined.
During a year, there were 11823 blood pressure measurements using the Korotkoff technique; heart rate was calculated by palpation.
These meteorological parameters were taken at the websites: http://meteo.infospace.ru and ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/stp/geomagnetic_data/indices/kp_ap.  The statistical significance of differences in the indicators was determined using the Fisher's test and the Newman-Keuls test.
The study used a correlation analysis with the calculation of the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
RESULTS
The maximum systolic and diastolic BP values were revealed in February and January, respectively.
The minimum values of systolic BP were detected in July; those of diastolic BP were in August.
An individual-based analysis of sensitivity to environmental variations showed that about 88% of the women responded to atmospheric temperature; nearly 44% did to geomagnetic activity; almost 24% were sensitive to relative air humidity, and about 16% of the women were to atmospheric pressure.
CONCLUSION
The dynamics of systolic and diastolic BP in the annual cycle of women depends on meteorological factors and suggests that there is a change in the priorities of its control in different periods of a year.
