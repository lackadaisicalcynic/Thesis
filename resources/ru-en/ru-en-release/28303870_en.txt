[Transoral approach to thyroid gland in the experiment].  AIM
To develop minimally invasive and safe endoscopic access to thyroid gland.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Transoral pre-mandibular video-assisted gas-free access to thyroid gland was developed in experimental study that included 19 human cadavers.
Stereometric modeling defined the evaluation criteria including the form of basal arch of lower jaw and its height.  There was no conflict of instruments in working chamber under platysma.
Additional trocar was deployed to resolve the conflict between working parts of instruments during thyroid gland mobilization.
The angle of operative action between the instruments is close to 90Â°.  Trocar hole is used for drainage.
RESULTS
The access provides good visualization of recurrent laryngeal nerve, upper and lower thyroid arteries and parathyroid gland.  It is less traumatic compared with other extra-cervical accesses to thyroid glands.
