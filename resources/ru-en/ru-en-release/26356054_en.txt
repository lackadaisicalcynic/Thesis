[Surgical treatment of aortic arch malformations in infants under cardiopulmonary bypass].
AIM
To evaluate long-term results and the causes of complications in congenital obstructive pathology of the aortic arch.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Retrospective study enrolled 62 patients aged 55 ± 14 days who underwent aortic arch surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass.  It was compared two methods of aortic archplasty: use of xenopericardial material in group 1 and Rajasinghe's autoplastic method in group 2.
RESULTS
Follow-up was 42 ± 14 months.
In the long-term recoarctation occurred in 7 (13.7%) cases including 6 (18.75%) patients in group 1 and one (3.3%) patient in group 2.
Residual hypertension was observed in 12 (23.5%) cases including 10 (37%) patients in group 1 and 2 (8.3%) patients in group 2.
Six (50%) patients receive antihypertensive therapy, 5 (41.6%) patients who receive antihypertensive drugs have persistent increase of blood pressure without evidence of anatomic aortic obstruction.
Hypertensive response to functional tests was observed in one patient.
CONCLUSIONS
Aortic arch reconstruction using autoplasty is associated with lower risk of recoarctationand residual hypertension compared with xenopericardial patch application.
