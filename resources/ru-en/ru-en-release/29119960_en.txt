[Scoliosis in the children: the new approaches to the treatment and rehabilitation].
Scoliosis is the most widespread orthopaedic condition affecting both the children and the adolescents.  The electrostatic field is known to promote the development of vibrations of varying strength in the biological tissues and their penetration rather deep into their interior.
AIM
The objective of the present study was to elucidate the possibilities and practicability of the application of a low-frequency electrostatic field for the conservative treatment of grade I and II scoliosis in the children and to develop the scientifically sound substantiation for the use of this technique in the clinical practice.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined and treated 94 children randomly divided into two groups (main and control) matched for the age and major clinical manifestation of the disease.  All the patients received basic therapy.
Those in the study group were additionally given low-frequency electrostatic therapy.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  The comparative analysis of the results of the treatment gave evidence that the application of a low-frequency electrostatic field for the conservative treatment of grade I and II scoliosis in the children resulted in the well apparent positive changes in their health status.
These changes manifested themselves in the favourable dynamics of both the clinical symptoms of the disease and as the improvement of the topographic and thermographic characteristics.
Of special importance is the alleviation of the symptoms of scoliotic deformation of the vertebral column under effect of the low-frequency electrostatic field.
CONCLUSION
The present study has demonstrated that the application of the low-frequency electrostatic field significantly increases the effectiveness of the treatment of grade I and II scoliosis in the children and adolescents and promotes regression of this pathological condition.
