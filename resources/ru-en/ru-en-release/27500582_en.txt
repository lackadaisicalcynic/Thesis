[Clinico-anamnestic diagnostics of chronic maxillary sinusitis associated with chlamydial infection].
The present study included 201 adult patients presenting with exacerbation of chronic maxillary sinusitis.
The presence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Chl. pneumoniae was verified by the direct immunofluorescencetechnique and polymerase chain reaction.
The study material consisted of swipes und swabs from the mucous membrane of the middle nasal passage.
The information from the patients was collected with the use of a questionnaire specially elaborated for the purpose of this study.
The correlation relationships were established by means of gamma-statistics.
The method is based on the calculation of the integral index characterizing the risk of development of chlamydial infection using the scoring scale for the evaluation of the clinical and anamnestic characteristics of the patients.
The assessment of the risk of chlamydial colonization by the anamnestic method makes it possible to enhance the effectiveness of clinical diagnostics of chlamydial infection and thereby provides a basis for the prescription of the adequate anti-chlamydial treatment facilitating reduction of the frequency of complications and preventing dissemination of the causative factor of the disease.  Moreover, this approach creates the conditions for the targeted selection of the patients to be referred to the laboratory verification of Chlamydia.
Highoperating performance and effectiveness characteristics of the clinic-anamnestic diagnostics make it a method of choice for the wide application in the clinical practice.
