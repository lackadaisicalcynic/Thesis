[Role of animal gastric Helicobacter species in human gastric pathology].  Animal Helicobacter species other than Helicobacter pylori are also able to cause human gastritis, gastric ulcers, and MALT lymphomas.
Animal Helicobacter species are presented with typical spiral fastidious microorganisms colonizing the gastric mucosa of different animals.
Bacteria initially received their provisional name Helicobacter heilmannii, and out of them at least five species colonizing the gastric mucosa of pigs, cats, and dogs were isolated later on.
A high proportion of these diseases are shown to be zoonotic.
Transmission of pathogens occurs by contact.  The factors of bacterial pathogenicity remain little studied.
