Inpatient management of children with severe acute malnutrition: a review of WHO guidelines.
OBJECTIVE  To understand how the World Health Organization's (WHO's) guidelines on the inpatient care of children with complicated severe acute malnutrition may be strengthened to improve outcomes.
METHODS
In December 2015, we searched Google scholar and WHO's website for WHO recommendations on severe acute malnutrition management and evaluated the history and cited evidence behind these recommendations.
We systematically searched WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, clinicaltrials.gov and the Controlled Trials metaRegister until 10 August 2015 for recently completed, ongoing, or pending trials.
FINDINGS
WHO's guidelines provide 33 recommendations on the topic.
However, 16 (48.5%) of these recommendations were based solely on expert opinion - unsupported by published evidence.
Another 11 (33.3%) of the recommendations were supported by the results of directly relevant research - i.e. either randomized trials (8) or observational studies (3).
The other six recommendations (18.2%) were based on studies that were not conducted among children with complicated severe malnutrition or studies of treatment that were not identical to the recommended intervention.
Trials registries included 20 studies related to the topic, including nine trials of alternative feeding regimens.
Acute medical management and follow-up care studies were minimally represented.
CONCLUSION
WHO's guidelines on the topic have a weak evidence base and have undergone limited substantive adjustments over the past decades.
More trials are needed to make that evidence base more robust.
If the mortality associated with severe malnutrition is to be reduced, inpatient and post-discharge management trials, supported by studies on the causes of mortality, are needed.
