[The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway: From the history of its discovery to clinical application].
The Wnt/β signaling pathway (Wnt-SP) is a phylogenetically ancient mechanism that regulates development and maintains tissue homeostasis through the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis.
The accurate regulation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Wnt-SP) is critical for embryogenesis and postnatal development; and impaired signal transduction at one of its stages leads to various diseases, including organ malformations, cancers, metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders.
The literature review discusses the biological role of the canonical Wnt-SP in the development of the skeleton and in the remodeling of bone tissue.  The Wnt signal transmission changes observed during genetic mutations cause various human skeletal diseases.
Understanding the functional mechanism involved in the development of bone abnormality could open new horizons in the treatment of osteoporosis, by affecting the Wnt-SP.
The design of antibodies to sclerostin, a Wnt-SP inhibitor, is most promising now.  The paper summarizes the studies that have investigated the canonical Wnt-SP and designed drugs to treat osteoporosis.
