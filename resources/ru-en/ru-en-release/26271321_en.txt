[Laparoscopic operations for chronic duodenal obstruction in children].  Brief literature review devoted to chronic duodenal obstruction is presented in the article.
We described an experience of treatment of 5 children with mechanical form of chronic duodenal obstruction.  Duodenal stenosis was observed in 2 patients.
Arteriomesenteric compression caused chronic duodenal obstruction in other children.
Duodenal obstruction was cured using laparoscopy in all cases.  Thus enteroalimentation has been started in early terms and intensive care unit stay and hospital stay was reduced.
