[A dyad approach to the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder].
AIM  To study anxiety in adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and their mothers and to evaluate the efficacy of a dyad approach (simultaneous treatment of the mother and the child) to ADHD treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-four adolescents, aged 12-15 years, with ADHD and their mothers were studied.
All participants of the study received anxiolytic treatment: children were treated with noophen (500 mg per day 45 days) and their mothers received adaptol (1500 mg per day 45 days).
In the comparison group with the same clinical/psychological characteristics, anxiolytic therapy with noophen was used only in adolescents.
RESULTS
Symptoms of anxiety were found in 61.7% of adolescents with ADHD and in 79.4% of the mothers.
After the dyad therapy, an improvement was noted in 73.5% of adolescents and 69.7% of the mothers.
There was an improvement in 63.3% of patients in the comparison group.
CONCLUSION
The results demonstrate the high efficacy of the dyad approach in treatment of ADHD with comorbid anxiety disorders.
