[Substantiation of the system of thrombus formation prevention in treatment of patients with hip joint pathology against the background of arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities].
AIM
To evaluate effectiveness of electroneurostimulation of the shin muscles as a constituent part of the prevention of TEC in the hip joint pathology at the hospital stage of treatment.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
With this purpose, there was conducted the extended comparative analysis of the parameters of the blood coagulation system in 27 patients with pathology of the hip joints and the stated concomitant vascular insufficiency.
The comparison group comprised 50 patients with uncomplicated pathology of the hip joint who underwent hip joint replacement surgery.  In the patients of both groups the product dabigatran etexilate in the standard dosage (220 mg/day) was used for specific prevention.
RESULTS
The authors managed to confirm qualitatively and quantitatively the effectiveness of the new variant of non-specific prevention in patients with a high risk of TEC development.  Similar changes of the parameters of blood coagulation system were obtained at the use of electroneurostimulation of the shin muscles against the background of the use of the direct anticoagulant dabigatran etexilate.
The numbers of thromboses in the group of patients with degenerative and dystrophic diseases of the hip joint with and without arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities are quite comparable (3.7 and 6%).
Recanalization of the veins of the lower extremities in every individual case was achieved at the use of therapeutic doses of dabigatran etexilate (300 mg/day).  The use of dabigatran etexilate permitted to minimize the risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at hip interventions and contributed to recanalization of veins in recent thromboses in the postoperative period.
