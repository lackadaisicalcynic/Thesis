RESULTS
There was an annual increase in the number of calls for all cases of hypertension complications in relation to the higher rate of hospitalization by 2014.
The causes of non-100% hospitalization for life-threatening hypertension complications were revealed.
Incomplete diagnostic data were one of the reasons for delayed diagnosis and development of prehospital complications from hypertension.
When emergency care was rendered, differentiation therapy for hypertension complications was not always withstood; the use of drugs was noted to be unwarranted and contrary to the data of evidence-based medicine.
