[Features of cytokines profile in various forms of systemic inflammatory response syndrome in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis].  AIM
Comparative evaluation of systemic concentration of some cytokines in various forms of SIR in patients with acute calculous cholecystitis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 32 patients with acute calculous cholecystitis and SIR.  According to ASSR/SCCM criteria SIR 2 was in 11, SIR 3 - in 8, SIR 4 - in 7 patients, 6 patients had sepsis.
Serum TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-10 were determined prior to surgery, in 3 and 7 days postoperatively by using of ELISA.
RESULTS
There was a cytokine imbalance whose severity depended on SIR severity and presence of sepsis.
CONCLUSION
Surgical intervention on background of basis therapy does not correct cytokine imbalance.  So adequate pharmacological correction is required.
