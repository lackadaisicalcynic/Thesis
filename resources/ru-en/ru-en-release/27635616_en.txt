[A possible relationship between disturbed interhemispheric asymmetry and a decrease in perineuronal oligodendrocytes in schizophrenia].  AIM
To specify a possible role of oligodendrocyte deficit in the development of interhemispheric asymmetry.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Perineuronal oligodendrocytes were counted in layer III, Broadmann area 39, in Nissl-stained sections in both hemispheres of post-mortem brain samples of patients with schizophrenia and controls (healthy people).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The left-hemispheric asymmetry of perineuronal oligodendrocytes was found in the control group.
A decrease of this parameter by 22% and the absence of the interhemispheric asymmetry were noted in patients with schizophrenia.
It has been concluded that perineuronal oligodendrocyte deficit in the inferior parietal cortex in schizophrenia can contribute significantly to disturbed interhemispheric asymmetry of this brain structure.
