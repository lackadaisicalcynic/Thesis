[Autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants].  The development of autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) is associated with the hyperergic reaction of the human immune system.
The development of autoimmune inflammation is preceded by contact with internal or external trigger factors (adjuvants) of immune disorders.
ASIA is associated with an individual genetic predisposition that is probably associated with the carriage of HLA-DRB1*01 or HLA-DRB4.
The paper presents five possible options for the impact of adjuvants in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders.
It gives diagnostic criteria for the syndrome, as well as its clinical, laboratory and morphological manifestations.
Emphasis is laid on the importance of morphological changes in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders.
The spectrum of morphological changes in ASIA is extensive.
The tissues show signs of immune inflammation, such as lymphohistiocytic infiltration, granulomatous inflammation, and scleroderma-like changes.
The characteristic feature is the regression of clinical, laboratory, and morphological manifestations after adjuvant removal.
