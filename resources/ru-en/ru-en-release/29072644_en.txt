[Gender related salivation features].  The aim of the study was to assess gender related salivation features.
One hundred and seventy-five patients were enrolled in the study (115 females and 60 males aged from 18 to 75 years).
The study results showed xerostomia to be more common in females and it's subjective symptoms are more prominent partly because of gender-related psychological reasons.
Xylitol-based paste and spray were successfully used for symptoms relief.
