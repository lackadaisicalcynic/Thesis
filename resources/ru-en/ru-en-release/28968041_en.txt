[Is it possible to rejuvenate the aging global civilization?]  Society is not only social system but also biological system.
Growing complexity of biological systems will inevitably lead to the loss of their potential immortality and to the appeared attribute of aging.
The aging of the present-day civilization is evidenced by the problems having accumulated.
The answer to the question concerning the possibility to prevent collapse depends on the answer to the more general question - whether supra-organismal system that due to the growth of the structure complexity has acquired the property to age without losing achieved complexity can return to ancestral potential immortality.
A positive response is given to this question.
Supra-organismal systems having been freed from the necessity to age exist.
Those are communities of social insects.
Some of them were mortal initially but in the course of evolution have lost attribute of aging.
Therefore, complex supra-organismal systems, including present-day civilization, can return to ancestral potential immortality not losing the achieved structural complexity.
The main obstacle to rejuvenating civilization is not the nature of things but the human mentality.
