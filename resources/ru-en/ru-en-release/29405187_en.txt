[The peculiar morphological features of the imprints of straight and wavy head hair dirtied with blood].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the specific morphological features of the imprints of blood-soaked straight and wavy head hair.
The contact imprints of straight and wavy head hair dirtied with blood were obtained experimentally.
The imprints of straight hair were shown to exhibit the elements in the form of the rectilinear and bow-shaped slightly bent stripes.
The imprints of wavy hair were shaped as the arches, waves, circles, and a large number of various small elements, such as dashes and commas.
