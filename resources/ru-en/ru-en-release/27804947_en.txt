[Necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis].  Necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis (NSG) belongs to productive small-vessel vasculitis with the formation of sarcoid-like granulomas, which is accompanied by ischemic necrosis of varying degrees and duration.
The disease involves the lung only.
The clinical symptoms of the disease are nonspecific so the latter is detected rather rarely.
The main diagnostic technique is morphological examination.
Immune complex inflammation develops in the vessel walls with the formation of macrophage-histiocytic granulomas that do not contain epithelioid cells.
The etiology and pathogenesis of NSG remain little studied.
Its differential diagnosis is mainly presented with tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
