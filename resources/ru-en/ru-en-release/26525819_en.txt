[Cerebrovascular diseases: perspectives of pathogenetic metabolic haemangiocorrective treatment].  Metabolic syndrome is a serious risk factor for acute and chronic cerebrovascular disease, which are a leading cause of disabling conditions.
The association of proatherogenic effects of the main components of metabolic syndrome--hyperinsulinemia, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity--leads to prominent haemorheological and hemostasis changes, which in turn play a pivotal role in the initiation, course and outcome of cerebrovascular pathology.
Metabolic syndrome also influences the efficacy of the main pathogenetic therapy of cerebrovascular diseases--antithrombotic therapy.  Thus, primary and secondary prevention of cerebrovascular disease in patients with metabolic syndrome should include haemangiocorrective, antithrombotic, antioxidant and endothelium-protective treatment, as well as therapy of the main components of metabolic syndrome.
