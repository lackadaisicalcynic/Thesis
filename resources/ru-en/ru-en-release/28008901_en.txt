[The role of plasmapheresis in prevention of complications after thoracoscopic thymectomy in patients with myasthenia combined with thymic hyperplasia].
Surgical indications for thymectomy include thymus tumour of different genesis as well as myasthenia.
Minimally invasive methods such as thorascopy and robot-assisted thymectomy have been widely used lately as well as standard surgical methods namely sternotomy and thoracotomy.
