AIM  the evaluation of localization claudin-1, -3 and -4 types of cancer and colon polyps.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 32 colon adenocarcinoma and 86 polyps.
Antibody claudin-1; -3 and -4 were used as immunohistochemical markers in this study.
RESULTS
84/118, 64/118, 52/118 reaction with claudin-1, claudin-3 and claudin-4 in cancer and colon polyps had a membrane localization, respectively.
In 33 (27.9%) cases was found paradoxical reaction claudin-1; in 50 (42.4%) - a paradoxical reaction claudin-3 in 66 (55.9%) - a paradoxical reaction claudin-4.
Among the paradoxical claudin reaction nuclear localization of marker was observed relatively rarely: claudin-3 in 2.5% cases of colon cancer; claudin-4 in 8.5% of colon polyps.
CONCLUSION
Mislocalization claudin-3 to nucleus in colon cancer and mislocalization claudin-4 to nucleus in adenomas of the colon were detected for the first time.
The potential reasons for the paradoxical expression are discussed and a review of the literature, related all the alleged mechanisms of this mislocalization is provided.
