[Approach for identifying of treatment option for pediatric patients in Guillain-Barre syndrome considering results of pharmacoeconomic analysis].  AIM
A pharmacoeconomic analysis of direct costs on treatment with high dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and plasmapheresis (PP) in children.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Literature data on the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) were analyzed.  The results of pharmacoeconomic analysis of direct costs on treatment of GBS using IVIG and PP are presented.
Risks for complications during treatment with IVIG and PP are calculated.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The pharmacoeconomic analysis demonstrates comparable costs of treatment with IVIG or PP in the Russian Federation.
Nevertheless, a less number of complications, convenience in use and the good safety and tolerability profile make it more preferable to this group of patients.
In a clinical case of a 7-year child described in the article, treatment with 10% IVIG - privigen in dose 2 g/kg during 5 days started in the 3rd week of disease showed a marked positive effect.
