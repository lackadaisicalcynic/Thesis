[Microcirculatory blood and lymph flow examination in eyelid skin by laser Doppler flowmetry].  AIM
to study normal blood and lymph microcirculation of the upper and lower eyelids in different age groups.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 108 volunteers (216 eyes) aged from 20 to 80 years with no signs of changes in anterior segment structures, who were grouped by age ranges (20-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-50 years, 51-60 years, 61-70 years, and 71-80 years) into 6 groups equal in gender and quantitative composition.
In all volunteers, microcirculation of the upper and lower eyelids was examined by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) ('LASMA MC-1' peripheral blood and lymph flow analyzer and 'LASMA MC' laser diagnostic complex, LASMA LLC). The average perfusion changes in blood and lymph flow as well as blood and lymph flow oscillations were analyzed.
RESULTS
Blood and lymph flow in the microvasculature of the upper and lower eyelids is variable and depends on neither the age, nor gender of the test subject.
On LDF-gram, every increase in amplitude of blood flow corresponds to a decrease in that of lymph flow.
CONCLUSION
The non-invasive method of LDF expands our diagnostic capabilities as it enables assessment of not only blood, but also lymph flow.
The data obtained can serve as a starting point for exploring microcirculation in different age groups in the presence of different pathological processes.
