[Neuroprotection therapy of multiple sclerosis with high doses of ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate].
AIM  To study the therapeutic action of ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate (mexidol) on the neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-two MS patients and 24 healthy controls were examined using DTI MRI with tractography.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate can prevent the progression of neurodegenerative processes in MS.  However, further clinical trials are needed to confirm the results obtained in this study.
