[Classical osteosarcoma in children and adolescent].  Classical osteosarcoma is one of the most common primary malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents.
It more frequently occurs in the areas of the highest growth plate proliferation: limb long bones particularly in the distal femur (30%), proximal tibia (15%), and proximal humerus (15%).  In the long bones, the tumor is located usually in the metaphysis (90%), less frequently in the diaphysis (9%), and very rarely in the epiphysis.
This paper considers the clinical, radiological, and histological diagnosis, and prognosis in this pathology.
