[Use of analgesia and sedation in dental implantology in patients with concomitant hypertension].
Dental implants surgery in patients with hypertension increases the risk of vascular complications.
The aim of the study was to examine the effect of analgesia and sedation on blood pressure and postoperative pain in dental implantology.
In 76 patients with hypertension implant surgery was performed under local anesthesia only (40 patients) or under local anesthesia with propofol sedation and pre-emptive analgesia with ketorolac (36 patients).
Intraoperative systolic blood pressure in the second group was 20% less than in the first group while the intensity of pain in the postoperative period in the second group was three times less than in the first one.
Propofol sedation in dental implantology provides hemodynamic stability in patients with concomitant hypertension and preemptive analgesia with ketorolac allows minimizing postoperative pain.
