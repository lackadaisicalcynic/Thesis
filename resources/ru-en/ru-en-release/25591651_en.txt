[The efficacy of add-on treatment with phenotropil in adult patients with locally-induced epilepsy].
Objective.
To study the efficacy and safety of phenotropil as add-on to treatment with standard antiepileptic drugs (AED) in patients with symptomatic locally-induced epilepsy (SLIE).
Material and methods.  Double-blind placebo controlled randomized trial was carried out.
Ninety patients were treated by phenotropil dose (100 or 200 mg) or placebo.  MMSE, HAM-D, MFI-20 and encephalography, including ла300 evoked potentials, were used.
Results and conclusion.
Phenotropil reduced the frequency of seizures and improved cognitive function in the absence of epileptiform EEG abnormalities.  The drug did not decrease negative effects of standard AED therapy in 40% of patients.
