[Sonographic characteristics of non-traumatic focal hourglass-like nerve constriction].
AIM  To describe the sonographic phenomenon of the focal 'hourglass-like constriction' of the peripheral nerves (FCPN).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The authors described 7 patients meeting the criteria for the diagnosis of neuralgic amyotrophy with unilateral FCPN identified with ultrasound in 4 cases and detected intraoperatively in 3 cases (preliminary ultrasound was not performed).
The US scanner Sonoscape Pro mode gray scale in the transverse and longitudinal scanning, linear probe 8-15 MHz and Logiq9 scanner with elastography were used.
RESULTS
FCPN was detected in the single nerve in 4 patients, in two nerves in 2 patients and in 3 nerves in one patient.
Among all the nerves involved in the pathological process, the radial nerve and its branches were affected in 73% (8 nerves); the ulnar nerve was involved in 18% (2 nerves) and the musculo-cutaneous nerve in 9%.
The length of the constriction of the peripheral nerve did not exceed 1.7 mm.
The deformation coefficient (DC) of constriction area was 3.8 to .,9; the change in the elasticity in the form of an increase of DC to 5.9 when compared to the intact portion of the nerve and a decrease in echogenicity were observed in one patient.
CONCLUSION
High-resolution ultrasound of the nerve can be an informative method for the diagnosis of idiopathic non-traumatic FCPN mononeuropathy.
