[Interintestinal anastomoses formation using permanent magnet in surgical treatment of children with intestinal stomas].
It was analyzed the results of treatment of 48 children aged from 1 month to 14 years.
In these observations by the 6th - 7th days after doubleintestinalstoma formation magnetic dies with inductance from 300 to 360 mTl and energy force at least 255 kJ/m3 were introduced into lumen of afferent and efferent intestinal loops.
Attractive or compression force between dies was 600 g, i.e. force per 1 cm2 was 200 g according to dies' surface 1.12.83.0 cm.
Magnets are not only surgical instruments but also physiotherapeutic devices improving microcirculation and stimulating regeneration in the area of anastomosis.  Interintestinal anastomosis has been completely formed for 5-7 days.
Thereafter magnetic dies have been removed.  Stool was normalized in 45 of 48 observations after surgery (1-3 times daily).
Intestinal discharge from ileostomy reduced to minimal amount.  In 2 patients irregular bowel movements was observed due to adhesive stenosis of interintestinal anastomosis.
Magnetic dies canot be established in 1 case due to adhesive process.  Hospital stay was from 10 to 25 days in 41 children.
7 patients were discharged for outpatient treatment later.  All children were under observation for the period 2-4 months after discharge.
Signs of hypotrophy including body weight deficit within 10% of age norm were diagnosed only in 3 children with prematurity degree I-II. Hereafter children were repeatedly hospitalized; intestinal stomas were surgically removed using conventional technique.
Thus complete convalescence was obtained.
