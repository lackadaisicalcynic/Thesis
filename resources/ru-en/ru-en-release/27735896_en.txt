[Evaluation of motor skills recovery in post-stroke patients in the process of complex rehabilitation with the use of robotic kinesiotherapy].
AIM  To compare the efficacy of complex rehabilitation in patients receiving robotic kinesiotherapy and conventional physical therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In total 68 patients were examined, including 37 patients receiving traditional kinesiotherapy and sessions on the robotic complex 'Locomat' and 31 patients of the control group who received conventional physical therapy.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
There were statistical between-group differences in the indices of mobility, physical capabilities, strength and muscle tone in paretic extremities as well as the overall improvement of daily activity.
The use of robotic devices has a positive impact on the rehabilitation of post-stroke patients.
