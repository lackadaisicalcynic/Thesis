[Panic disorder: clinical phenomena and treatment options].  Panic disorder is a common mental disease with high psychiatric comorbidity.
It is considered that a combination of genetic predisposition and a special psychic vulnerability plays a key role in the occurrence of panic disorder.
Clinically proven efficacy in the treatment of panic disorder have benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; antidepressants from other pharmaceutical groups are also used.  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the first line medicines in the treatment of panic disorder.
Atypical antipsychotics may be used for the therapy augmentation in addition to first line drugs.  Psychotherapy is used along with medications, and a combination of pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy is the best method of treatment.
