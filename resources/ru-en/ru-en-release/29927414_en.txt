[The study of factors affecting attitude towards people with mental illness in Azerbaijan].
AIM  To determine the factors that shape attitudes towards people with severe mental disorders as well as to establish correlations between these factors and socio-demographic variables.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cross-sectional study was conducted among 1000 respondents in five regions of the country.
The questionnaire included different aspects concerning the relation of society towards people with mental disorders.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The study established three-factor structure of attitudes towards people with mental illness: social distance, perseption of social threat, tolerant attitude Older age and a personal acquaintance with the patient were associated with lower ratings of social distance, while female gender was associated with a greater level of perception of social threat.
The tolerant attitude is positively correlated with marital status and familiarity with the patients, and negatively with the presence of mental illness in the family.
The three-factor structure allows better understanding of various aspects in stigmatization of people with mental disorders.
