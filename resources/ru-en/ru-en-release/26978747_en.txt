[Peculiar features of immunological and metabolic status associated with polypous rhinosinusitis].  The objective of the present work was to study peculiar features of immunological and metabolic status associated with polypous rhinosinusitis (PRS).
We determined the population and subpopulation composition of blood lymphocytes, concentration of cytokines in blood sera and nasal secretion as well as the level of intracellular enzymes in blood lymphocytes of the patients presenting with polypous rhinosinusitis and of the control subjects.
It was shown that PRS was associated with activation of Th1-lymphocytes and determined the character of the immune response largely of the cell-mediated type.
The study has demonstrated the differently directed changes in the activation of the intracellular processes in blood lymphocytes.  Specifically, the intensity of the aerobic processes and lipid anabolism was increased while that of the anaerobic processes and amino acid metabolism (NAD-GDG and NADH-GDG) was suppressed.
