[The «Dialogue» or the «Conflict of interests» between psychiatrists and neurologists: results of a focus group interview].
OBJECTIVE
To determine the characteristics of interdisciplinary interactions between neurologists and psychiatrists in treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders, including prognostic aspects, and the responsibility of the doctor.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A scenario of an interview included similar questions related to diagnosis, examination and the treatment of patients with anxiety and depressive disorders.  Ten neurologists and 10 psychiatrists have completed the interview.
RESULTS
The characteristics of the management of patients, the absence of the joint management and interactions, subjective adherence to definite drugs and methods were shown.  CONCLUSION
The intersection of professional interests for both specialties because of the similarities of the groups of patients in the conditions of concurrent interdisciplinary interactions makes up the reason for the conflict between them.  An introduction of an interdisciplinary model of interactions between the physicians and specified continual education in adjacent fields of medicine will resolve this situation.
