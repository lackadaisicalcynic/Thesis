[The role of gastroesophageal reflux disease in the development of chronic exudative otitis media in the children during the first year of life].  The objective of the present study was the determination of the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease and the evaluation of its possible influence on the development and duration of chronic exudative otitis media in the children during the first year of life.
A total of 141 infants at the age of 3 months presenting with exudative otitis media refractory to the conservative treatment throughout the first 1-1.5 months of life were available for the examination.
The effectiveness of the anti-reflux therapy was estimated based on the middle ear condition (the presence or absence of exudate) within 3 and 6 months after the initiation of the treatment.
The signs of aspiration of gastric chimus and gastroesophageal reflux disease were documented in 92% of the cases.
The anti-reflux treatment during 3 months resulted in the disappearance of the manifestations of exudative otitis media in 43% of the patients.  The further prolongation of such therapy up to 6 months allowed to normalize the state of the middle ear in 69% of the children although the remaining 40% failed to respond.
It is concluded that the treatment of the children presenting with exudative otitis media during first year of life should be performed taking into consideration the possible involvement of gastroesophageal reflux disease in pathogenesis of this pathological condition.
