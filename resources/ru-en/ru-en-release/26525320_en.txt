[The role of mycological culture studies in diagnostics of otomycoses].  The present work was designed to analyze the results of themycological culture study involving 350 patients at the age varying from 14 to 75 years with the diagnosis otomycosis.
The pathogenic fungi known to induce the clinical picture of otomycosiswere identified in 227 (64.8%) patients.
The majority of the pathogeneticall most significant species belonged to the genus Candida (45.4%).
The mold fungi occurred in 30.8% of the patients.  In 11.5% of the cases, they occurred together with bacterial microflora and in 6.7% of the cases in association with the yeast fungi.
The species of the genus Aspergillus prevailed among the mold fungi.
It is concluded that the complicated forms of otomycosisdevelop as a result of infection caused not only by mold fungi but also by yeast fungi and/or associations of the two groups.  These findings suggestthe necessity of usingthe differential approach to the prescription of the adequate medications.
