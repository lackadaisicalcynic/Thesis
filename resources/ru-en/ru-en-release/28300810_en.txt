Insomnia due to hypnotic abuse and dependence is a common and serious problem of somnology irrespectively of which one comes first: sleep disturbances or drug use.  Modern hypnotics demonstrate selective affinity to some types of benzodiazepine receptors.
This explains its higher safety profile compared to first-generation hypnotics.  Nevertheless, there are reports of dependence and withdrawal syndrome associated with its administration as well.
This literature review shows that seizures, hemodynamic and respiratory disturbances are the most dangerous symptoms of withdrawal.  Treatment of hypnotic dependence includes detoxication and gradual withdrawal of medicines.
