[Extended endoscopic endonasal posterior (transclival) approach to tumors of the clival region and ventral posterior cranial fossa.  Part 3.
Analysis of surgical treatment outcomes in 127 patients].
Until recently, tumors of the clival region and ventral posterior cranial fossa were considered hard-to-reach and often inoperable via standard transcranial approaches.  The introduction of minimally invasive methods combined with the endoscopic technique into neurosurgical practice has enabled removal of hard-to-reach tumors, including midline tumors of the ventral posterior cranial fossa.
OBJECTIVE
To improve and introduce the extended endoscopic endonasal posterior (transclival) approach into clinical practice and to analyze the results of its application in surgical treatment of midline skull base tumors extending into the ventral posterior cranial fossa.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
During the period from 2008 to the present, we have operated 127 patients with various skull base tumors located in the clival region and ventral posterior cranial fossa (60 males and 67 females); the patients' age was 3 to 74 years.  The distribution of tumors by histology was as follows: 96 (75.6%) chordomas, 9 (7.1%) pituitary adenomas, 8 (6.3%) meningiomas, 3 (2.33%) cholesteatomas, 2 (1.6%) craniopharyngiomas, 3 (2.33%) fibrotic dysplasia, and 6 (4.7%) other tumors (giant cell tumor, glioma of the neurohypophysis, osteoma, plasmacytoma, carcinoid tumors, chondroma).
The tumor size was as follows: 36 (28.35%) giant (more than 60 mm) tumors, 71 (55.9%) large (35-59 mm) tumors, 19 (14.96%) medium (21-35 mm) tumors, and 1 (0.79%) small (less than 20 mm) tumor.
Intraoperative monitoring of the cranial nerves was performed (20 cranial nerves were identified) in 10 cases.
RESULTS
The extent of chordoma resection was as follows: total removal - 63 (65.62%) cases, subtotal removal - 23 (23.96%) cases, and partial removal - 10 (10.42%) cases.
Pituitary adenomas were resected totally in 6 cases, subtotally in 1 case, and partially in 2 cases.
Meningioma was removed subtotally in 4 cases, partially in 3 cases, and less than 50% in 1 case.
Other tumors (cholesteatoma, craniopharyngioma, fibrous dysplasia, giant cell tumor, glioma of the neurohypophysis, osteoma, plasmacytoma, carcinoid tumors, chondroma) were removed totally in 7 cases and subtotally in 7 cases.
Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred in 9 (7.2%) cases, and meningitis developed in 12 (9.4%) cases.
Oculomotor disorders occurred in 17 (13.4%) patients; in 10 of these patients, the disorders regressed within 4 to 38 days after surgery; in 7 patients the oculomotor disorders did not regress.
A lethal outcome occurred in 2 (1.57%) cases.
CONCLUSION
The extended endoscopic endonasal posterior (transclival) approach, being minimally invasive, enables removal of various midline skull base tumors with/without involvement of the clivus with high radicalness, low risk of postoperative complications, and low lethality.  Until recently, these tumors were considered almost inoperable.
