[Clinical and diagnostic rationale for the final stage of orthodontic treatment].  The aim of the study was to improve the efficiency of the final stage of orthodontic treatment.
The study included 32 patients divided into two groups of 16.
Orthodontic treatment was performed using a bracket system active self-ligation straight arc technique with step adjustment anthropometric quantitative evaluation system (The ABO Model Grading System).
Centric occlusion and centric relation were analyzed at baseline and after treatment by mandible position indicator MPI (Mandibular Position Indicator).
The first group received treatment according to conventional protocol, in the second group braces were readjusted by indirect bonding after ABO anthropometric measurements.
The efficiency of orthodontic treatment using ABO system at the late stages of adjustment in the second group was significantly higher than in the first group (p=0.002248; p=0.023431, respectively).  MPI analysis in the first group in 10 (62.5%) patients showed mismatch of centric occlusion and centric relation not seen in the second group.
In 3 (18.75%) patients of group 2 the difference did not exceed 0.5 mm which was considered normal.
Thus, the application of ABO anthropometric system followed by readjustment of incorrectly positioned brackets by indirect bonding promotes MPI values improvement, which in turn allows getting the most accurate, and stable results of orthodontic treatment.
