[Five-year survival and outcomes of chronic hip stump ischemia treatment].  AIM
To investigate five-year survival, short- and long-term outcomes of hip stump ischemia treatment.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 383 patients with hip stump in 1997-2013.  Critical hip stump ischemia in 3 months after amputation occurred in 45 patients.
RESULTS
Two-fold decrease of 5-year survival was found.
Five-year survival was higher 3 times in patients after arterial reconstruction compared with those without revascularization.
The same tendency was confirmed in analysis of groups standardized by gender, age and type of arterial disease.
