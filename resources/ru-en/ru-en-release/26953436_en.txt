[The possibility of increasing the tooth enamel caries in children and adolescents through an integrated remineralizes fluoropolymer coatings with tricalcium phosphate].
In the survey we conducted a prospective cohort oral 138 children and adolescents living in the same environmental conditions.  To study the effect of the complex representation remineralizes fluorine-containing tricalcium phosphate coating for the prevention of caries-the process in childhood, all surveyed were divided into 3 groups with high, medium and low enough average caries based on clinical and laboratory examination.
The authors found a 7-fold the efficiency of preventive measures in the group with sufficient average caries and 5 times the efficiency in the group with low average caries in relation to subgroups where remineralizes-present fluorine-containing coating with tricalcium phosphate is not applicable.
Furthermore, it was found that the accumulation of fluorine occurs only in a surface layer of the enamel within 100 micrometers.
