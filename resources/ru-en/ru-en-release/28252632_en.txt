[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with mesenteric teratoma].  The paper describes a case of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in a 27-year-old woman whose examination revealed mesenteric teratoma.
AIHA was characterized by a hypertensive crisis and a temporary response to corticosteroid therapy that was complicated by the development of somatogenic psychosis and discontinued.
A relapse of hemolysis developed 6 months later.
The patient underwent laparoscopic splenectomy and removal of mesenteric root teratoma.
Immediately after surgery, a hematological response was obtained as relief of hemolysis and restoration of a normal hemoglobin level.
There is a sustained remission of AIHA for the next 16 months.
