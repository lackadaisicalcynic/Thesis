[Endoscopic transpapillary lithoextraction in case of parapapillary diverticulum].
AIM
To present the experience of endoscopic transpapillary procedures in patients with parapapillary diverticulum.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Endoscopic transpapillary treatment of choledocholithiasis was performed in 16.8% (423) of patients with suspected bile ducts stones for the period from August 2010 to January 2015.  There were parapapillary diverticulum in all cases.
Patients' age was from 29 to 92 years, there were 121 men and 302 women.  Endoscopic transpapillary bile drainage was made in 407 (96.3%) cases.
One-stage treatment was performed in 352 (83.2%) patients.  The results of endoscopic transpapillary procedures in patients with parapapillary diverticulum were analyzed.
RESULTS
We revealed high efficacy of transpapillary interventions in these patients.  Herewith visualization of large duodenal papilla, determination of ducts' anatomic relations with diverticular and intestinal walls and adherence to main methodical and technical aspects of procedure are very important for successful treatment.
