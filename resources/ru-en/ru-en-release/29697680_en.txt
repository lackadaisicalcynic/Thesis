[Specialist's training for laparoscopic surgery in Wet-lab educational operating theatre].
AIM
To develop system for students training in laparoscopic surgery by using of Wet-lab educational operating theatre.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We have launched laparoscopic surgery teaching program for students of Ryazan State Medical University.
This system includes several stages.  At the first stage professional selection was carried out on 'dry' laparoscopic simulators among III-IV-year students of medical faculty.
So, 10 people were selected.
The second stage included theoretical and practical parts consisting of development of basic laparoscopic skills on 'dry' simulators.
5 students who scored the maximum points were admitted to the next stage.
The third stage is working in Wet-lab operating theatre with a mentor.
There were 10 sessions on 10 laboratory pigs.
Final stage of our study compares two groups of participants: main group - 5 students who underwent above-described program and control group of 5 residents without experience for laparoscopic operations.
RESULTS
The participants of the main group had significantly higher OSATS score compared with another group (20 vs. 10; p<0.05).
Movements effectiveness estimated by measuring of movements trajectory total length was also higher in main group than in control group (6 vs. 20; p<0.05).
Experts' subjective assessment according to 10-point scale was also higher for students than for interns (9 vs. 5, p<0.05).
Participants in the main group required significantly less time to complete the task compared with the control group (40 vs. 90 minutes, p<0.05).
CONCLUSION
Our experience has shown that training system with Wet-lab operating theatre is effective for quick and efficient training of medical students in main laparoscopic procedures.
In our opinion, introduction of students into 'advanced' surgery from early age will make it possible to get finally highly professional specialists.
