[Study of mutual dependence of periodontal and colonic microbiome in health and pathology using NSG-sequencing].  By using NGS-sequencing libraries of DNA from periodontal swabs with primers specific to V6 region of 16S rDNA prevalence of bacterial genera and species in periodontal and colonic microbiota of patients with periodontitis of different severity and healthy donors was analyzed.
Hyper-colonization of the colon with Akkermansia muciniphila was found to be the most important maker of negative predisposition to periodontitis (t=133,7 at Ñ€=10(-6)).
This result is in a good agreement with communications about positive impact of hyper-colonization of the colon with this species on type 2 diabetes, obesity, atopic dermatitis, and antibiotic-induced diarrhea associated with Clostridium dificile.
Analysis of the periodontal protectors at the periodontium elucidated a number of close taxonomic relatives of the periodontal pathogens by Socransky, e.g. Aggregatibacter segnis and Aggregatibacter aphrophilus are closely related to Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; Treponema vencentii is a relative of Treponema denticola; Prevotella baroniae, Prevotella salivae and Prevotella spp. are relatives of Prevotella intermedia; Campylobacter concisus is a relative of Campylobacter jejuni, causative agent of enterocolitis.
