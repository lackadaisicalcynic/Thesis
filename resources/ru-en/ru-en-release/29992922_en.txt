[Cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory support in Petrovsky Russian Research Center for Surgery].  Since initial application of cardiopulmonary bypass (1960) and circulatory support (1977) unique methods of extracorporeal circulation have been developed at Petrovsky Russian Research Center for Surgery.
Some of them were introduced for the first time in the country (USSR and then in the Russian Federation).  It was possible due to creative team of Boris Vasilyevich Petrovsky, whose potential was aimed at expanding the indications for surgical treatment of cardiac, aortic, liver, lung and kidney diseases under artificial circulation and then circulatory support.
