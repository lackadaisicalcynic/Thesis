[Carotid revascularization in type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Significance of chronic hyperglycaemia].
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) are typically prone to the development of cerebral atherosclerosis.  Presented herein are the results of examination of patients suffering from ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases on the background of type 2 DM subjected to open surgical or endovascular interventions.
In patients with cerebrovascular pathology and type 2 DM, atherosclerosis progresses on the background of chronic hyperglycaemia combined with dyslipidaemia, leading to increased incidence of the development of cerebral circulatory impairments and detection of the indications for carrying out angioreconstructive operations on the internal carotid arteries.  The presence of type 2 DM is associated with increased risk for the development of ischaemic lesions of the brain matter while performing carotid endarterectomy and endovascular interventions which are associated with higher values of glycaemia (8.0 mmol/l) and glycated haemoglobin
(7.8-8 %) prior to the operation.
