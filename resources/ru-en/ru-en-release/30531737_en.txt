[Endogenic antimicrobial peptides and cytokines in calculous cholecystitis].  AIM
To analyze concentration of some antimicrobial peptides and cytotoxins in acute calculous cholecystitis regarding gallbladder inflammation grade.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 69 patients with catarrhal (29), phlegmonous (24) inflammation and gangrenous phlegmon (19).  Some antimicrobial peptides (HNP-α, BPI, endotoxin, neutrophil elastase, lactoferritin, hepcidin) and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, 8, 10) in blood serum as well as hepcidin, TNF-α and IL-6 in hepatic biopsy samples were assessed.
RESULTS  Significantly increased concentration of all antimicrobial peptides and cytokines was observed in all patients at admission compared with healthy persons.
Changes depended on severity of gallbladder inflammation.  There was a positive correlation of antimicrobial peptides and TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8.
CONCLUSION
The use of antimicrobial peptides as the most informative biomarker for early diagnosis of destructive acute cholecystitis reduces postoperative morbidity.
