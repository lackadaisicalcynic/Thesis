[An experimental evaluation of the therapeutic window of the neuroprotective activity of a low-molecular nerve growth factor mimetic GK-2].  AIM
To identify the time interval for the preservation of the effect of GK-2 depending on the start of administration after modeling ischemic stroke by the transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The experiments were performed on 33 wild-type male rats and 81 male Wistar rats.  Animals were kept in standard conditions.
Ischemic stroke was modelled by thread occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  It was found that GK-2 at a daily dose of 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, during 7 days statistically significantly reduces brain infarct volume by 20-60% at the first injection from 4 to 24h, with the highest effect 6-8 hours after surgery.
Thus, the 'therapeutic window' of GK-2 detected in the experiment is no less than 24 hours, which exceeds the existing neuroprotective agents.
