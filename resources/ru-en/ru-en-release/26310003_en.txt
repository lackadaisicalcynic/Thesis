AIM  to determine the frequency and severity of dry eye syndrome (DES) in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients that are newly diagnosed or already receiving beta blocker instillation therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 127 patients (190 eyes) with POAG were divided into two groups.
Group 1 included 55 newly diagnosed patients (88 eyes), group 2-72 POAG patients (102 eyes) instilling timolol 0.5% twice daily into the affected eye.
The control group included 20 patients (40 eyes) aged 60-88 years (73.6 Â± 9.2 years on average) with early age-related cataract.
RESULTS
DES was found in 69 POAG patients (79%) who was just starting their topical hypotensive therapy and 85 of those (84%) under treatment (p = 0.39).
CONCLUSIONS
One should take into account when prescribing ocular hypotensive therapy that newly diagnosed POAG patients usually already suffer from a dry eye.
The use of topical beta blockers that contain preservatives exacerbates dry eye signs and symptoms in these patients.
