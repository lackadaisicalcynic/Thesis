[Changes in walking in the elderly].  The article addresses gait disturbances in the elderly.
It emphasizes that the system that maintains the balance in resting conditions and gait is based on the hierarchical principle and its function depends on the maintenance of integration between vestibular, visual and somatosensory information as well as on cognitive functions.
Walking depends on the integrity of frontal-subcortical neuronal circles that support regulatory functions.
The main pathogenetic mechanisms of age-related disturbances of balance and gait are a decrease in the efficacy of spinal motorneurons activation caused by Ia-afferentation, a decrease in cortical activation and excitability of corticospinal pathways and in the intensity of intracortical inhibition.
The causes of age-related changes in walking are not confined to a single system (e.g., one sensory modality) but have a multisystem character and are involved in many structures.  The author analyses the results of recent studies that use functional neuroimaging methods.
