[A study of combination treatment with nacom (levodopa + carbodope) and citicoline in the model of Parkinson disease in rats].  AIM
To evaluate the efficacy of the combined use of citicoline (neipilept) and levodopa/carbidopa (nakom) in the rotenone model of Parkinson's disease in rats.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Rotenone was administrated during 14 days in dose 2 mg/kg/day subcutaneously.
The duration of treatment was 7 days, intragastrically.  Alteration of locomotor behavior components, muscular rigidity in resistance to passive flexion in the ankle joint and signs of extrapyramidal disorders were assessed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Combined therapy led to the decrease in muscle rigidity (the decrease of gibbosity in resistance to passive flexion in the ankle joint).  There was a decrease in oligokinesia that emerged in higher vertical and horizontal locomotor activity of experimental animals, decrease in the time of head turning during climbing down the pole and total time of climbing down the pole.
The combination of drugs had a more pronounced therapeutic effect on extrapyramidal disorders compared to monotherapy.
