[The problem of molecular-genetic identification of sweat and grease deposits in the human fingerprints].  The objective of the present experimental molecular-genetic study of DNA contained in of human fingerprints was to establish the relationship between the reference genetic profiles and the genotypes of the individuals leaving their fingerprints on a smooth metal object.
The biological material for the purpose of the investigation was sampled at different time intervals.
The were taken using a scotch tape and used to obtain the complete genetic profile immediately after the fingerprints had been left as well as within the next 24 hours and one week.
It proved impossible to identify the complete genetic profile one month after the fingerprints had been left.
The alleles not typical for reference samples were identified within one week after swabbing the material from the metal surface.
The results of the sudy can be explained by the decrease of the concentration of the initial DNA-matrix in the samples due to its degradation in the course of time.
It is concluded that the parallel genetic analysis is needed if reliable evidence of identity of the profiles of interest or its absence is to be obtained.
