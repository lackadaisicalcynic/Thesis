[Modern approaches to dental implants placement in deficient alveolar bone].  The paper presents statistical data on implant placement procedures in Central Research Institute of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery (Moscow, Russia) in 2010-2015.
In 64% of cases inadequate bone volume was attributed to alveolar bone atrophy.
Bone deficiency was equally often in upper and lower jaws (in 49.3 and 50.7%, correspondently) but varied in forms with complex configurations to be more specific for maxilla.  The study also includes a series of clinical cases illustrating implant placement procedures in anatomically unfavorable settings.
