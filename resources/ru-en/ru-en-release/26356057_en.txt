[Methods of acute pancreatitis prevention after endoscopic transpapillary interventions].  AIM
To optimize preventive methods of acute postoperative pancreatitis in endoscopic transpapillary interventions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  It is performed parallel unblinded randomized investigation.
The first group included 98 patients who underwent endoscopic transpapillary interventions and thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA).  The second group consisted of 97 patients in whom opiate analgesic intramuscularly and indomethacin per rectum were applied.
RESULTS
Study revealed that acute pancreatitis has been diagnosed significantly more seldom in patients after TEA than in the second group (OR 0.22, CI 95%, 0.06-0.83).
Thus in TEA-group pancreatitis was verified in 3.1% (3 of 98 patients), in the second group - in 12.4% (12 of 97 patients).
Incidence of pancreatitis decreased from 23.3% (10 of 43) to 4.3% (2 of 46) among high risk patients (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.75).
CONCLUSION
TEA is effective and justified preventive method in patients with high risk of postoperative pancreatitis.
In low risk patients use of indomethacin per rectum is preferred compared with TEA due to its invasiveness.
