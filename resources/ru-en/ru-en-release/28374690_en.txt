[Tthe efficacy and safety of drug therapy divaza in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia].
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of divazа in the treatment of cognitive and emotional disorders in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) based on clinical findings and laboratory markers of endothelial dysfunction.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty patients with CCI, aged 40 to 70 years, were examined.  All patients were treated with divazа (2 tablets 3 times a day) for 12 weeks.
Cognitive functions and markers of endothelial dysfunction (the activity of endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS), the number of circulating desquamated endothelial cells in blood plasma) were measured at baseline and after treatment.  RESULTS
Divazа significantly reduced the severity of clinical symptoms and had a positive effect on endothelial dysfunction normalizing the tone of cerebral vessels and preventing deendotheliazation.
CONCLUSION
The use of divazа resulted in clinical improvement and normalization of markers of endothelial dysfunction as well.
