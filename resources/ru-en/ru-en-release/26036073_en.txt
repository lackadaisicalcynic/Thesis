[The chemico-toxicological determination of dilthiasem].  The objective of the present study was to determine the optimal conditions for isolation of dilthiasem, its purification by the combination of the extraction and column chromatography techniques, and the development of the universal method for the detection of this compound in the biological material.
Other research methods included thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GH-MS), extraction, low-pressure column chromatography, and spectrophotometry.
The effectiveness of dilthiasem isolation from the biological material with the use of 12 organic substances, water, and aqueous solutions was compared.
The use of acetone as the universal solvent for dilthiasem isolation from the tissues and biological fluids of the cadaveric organs was substantiated.
It was shown that dilthiasem can be purified from endogenous substances contained in the biological materials by means of combined liquid-liquid extraction and chromatography on the 30 mcm Silasorb C-18 column.
The new modifications of thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GH-MS) are proposed for the identification and quantitative determination of dilthiasem isolated from cadaveric blood and hepatic tissue.
