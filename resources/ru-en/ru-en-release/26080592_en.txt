[Correction of paralytic lagophthalmos].  Current options for correction of paralytic lagophthalmos are either temporary (external eyelid weight placement, hyaluronic acid gel or botulinum toxin A injection) or permanent (various procedures for narrowing of the palpebral fissure, upper eyelid weights or spring implantation).
Neuroplastic surgery (cross-facial nerve grafting, nerve anastomoses) and muscle transposition surgery is not effective enough.
The majority of elderly and medically compromised patients should not be considered for such complicated and long procedures.
Upper eyelid weight implantation thus appears the most reliable and simple treatment.
