[Demographic and social predictors of place of death in the group of elderly].
Analysis of data from the 2814 Medical certificates of death was performed to reveal socio-demographic characteristics of citizens who died at elderly age, depending on the place of death and alcohol anamnesis.  Divorced or single elderly people with lower educational status had greater odds ratio to die «on the street» or «at home» rather than in a «medical organization» (respectively to characteristics of demographic status and the structure of causes of death).
Clinically verified diagnosis of «Mental and behavioral disorders due to alcohol» (F10) in anamnesis was not associated with the «choice» of place of death among elderly people.  Obtained results can be used to develop the regional programs in the field of public health.
