[Ischemic stroke in young adults].  The authors have analyzed the causes of ischemic stroke (IS) in more than 600 young patients examined in the cerebrovascular department of the Neurological Research Center (Moscow) during the period 2003-2016 years.
It has been suggested that a wider use of high-resolution MRI and T1 weighted db-fs images as well as intracranial CTA will help to verify more often intracranial dissection and primary cerebral vasculitis that will result in a decrease of cryptogenic IS frequency.
