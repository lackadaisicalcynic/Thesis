The effects of seizures?]  This review discusses articles on cognitive impairments developing after one or more convulsive seizures.
Cognitive disorders seem to be frequent complications of epilepsy.  According to recent clinical studies, the intensity of cognitive declines depends on a frequency and severity of seizures.
However, presence of an epileptic focus does not always indicate an increase in cognitive impairments.  An effect of a single convulsive seizure on cognitive functions at this stage is uncertain.
According to some data, cognitive impairments after a single generalized seizures develop only in specific clinical syndromes, on the other hand, they are influenced by the emotional state of the subject.
This problem remains relevant today.  Further work is needed in this direction.
