[A comparison of characteristics of pathologic hobbies in schizophrenic patients of different age].
OBJECTIVE
To analyze age-related pathologic hobbies in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty-three inpatients, aged from 4 to 16 years, and 31 patients, aged from 18 to 65 years, were studied.  Clinical/psychopathological analysis, psychological experiment and clinical statistics were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Pathological hobbies substantially differed depending on the age (3-6, 7-15 and 18-65 years).  In preschool age, hobbies were immature and infantile, arose autochthonously, their course was relatively stable and they had limited maladaptive effects.
In junior school/teenager age, hobbies were more distinct and were associated with more diverse and mature realization patterns.
Their origin was more depended on environmental factors, the course was persistent or attack-like with more pronounced and steady maladaptive effects.
In some cases, there was a trend to pathological hobby progression.  Abnormal hobbies in patients of mature age were the most diverse in their subjects and forms of realization as well as in their clinical variants and dynamic types.
In the group of mature patients with schizophrenic spectrum disorders, there was a significantly higher percentage of psychotic forms of pathological hobbies.
