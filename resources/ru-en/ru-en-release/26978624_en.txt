[Performance evaluation of comprehensive treatment of patients with infectious complications of bullet-extremity fractures].
The objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of complex treatment of patients with infectious complications of gunshot fractures of limb bones using advanced minimally invasive surgical technologies phased osteosynthesis and new approaches of drug therapy.  A prospective, comparative study of the results of examination and treatment of 60 patients with infectious complications of gunshot diaphyseal fractures of the long bones of the limbs treated in hospital Almutavakel (Sana'a, Republic of Yemen) in the period 2009-2011.
Patients were randomized and divided into groups depending on the treatment regimen: a comparison (30 patients) received traditional scheme in which only apply external fixation devices or metal obsolete models and basic (30 patients), received treatment for advanced techniques include minimally invasive surgical sanitation of infected fracture zone followed by differentiated (depending on the size of the existing bone defect) tactics of consistent and gradual minimally invasive functionally stable osteosynthesis with modern APS and implants on a background of conservative therapy consisting of Cycloferon.  The study showed a high clinical and cost-effectiveness of improved methods compared to traditional, that allows to recommend it for the provision of specialized medical care in the treatment of patients with infectious and complicated gunshot fractures of the long bones of the limbs.
