[Prognostic factors of recurrent acute cerebrovascular incidents in patients with ischemic stroke].  OBJECTIVE
To establish prognostic factors of recurrent acute cerebrovascular complications after ischemic stroke.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A prospective observational study on the 21-22nd day of the acute stage of ischemic stroke included 148 patients, aged 60 [5; 68] years.
Following the discharge, a unified telephone survey of patients or their relatives was performed every 3 months.
Recurrent strokes, including those with fatal outcome, and transient ischemic attacks (TIA) were recorded.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The long-term prospective follow-up duration was 35 [28; 40] months.
In 26 (18%) patients, 31 cerebral complications, including 24 recurrent ischemic strokes, 6 TIA, 1 hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage were registered.
Recurrent cerebral complications found to be associated with age older 67 years, ischemic heart disease, multiple focal brain lesions, supraventricular arrhythmias more 46/day, bradyarrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias.
The use of thiazide and thiazide-liked diuretics as part of antihypertensive therapy was associated with a reduced risk of cerebral complications.
