[Dynamics of the intestinal biocenosis, indicators of the blood lipid profile, antioxidant system, and energy metabolism in the patients presenting with chronic non-calculous cholecystitis under the influence of the therapeutic physical factors in the combination with probiotics].
The present study included 60 patients presenting with chronic non-calculous cholecystitis and intestinal dysbiosis.  It has been demonstrated that the application of the 'Nor Narine' probiotic in the combination with 'Djermuk' hydrocarbon sodium sulfate mineral water and the pre-formed physical factors, in the first place the magnetic laser radiation, increases the effectiveness of the rehabilitative treatment of the patients.
Such treatment resulted not only in the positive dynamics of the clinical picture of disease but also in the well apparent marked tendency toward normalization of the intestinal biocenosis, the lipid blood spectrum, the antioxidant system, and the energetic exchange.
