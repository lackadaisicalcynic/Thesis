[The peculiar biochemical properties of the support structures in the human tissues].  This article is focused on the methodological aspects of the evaluation of the elastic and mechanical strength characteristics of the tissues that form the flexible fibrous and osseous human skeleton.
The samples of dura mater and spongy bone (ribs) were subjected to the quantitative analysis for the determination of their bioelemental composition.
The study has demonstrated that the force needed to brake dura mater or a rib correlates with the content of biological elements in these tissue, as well as with the age and sex of the human subjects serving as teir sources.
