[Metabolic syndrome and cognitive impairment in aging patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy].  The relationship between metabolic syndrome and its individual components, leptin levels and the severity of cognitive impairment in patients of different age with dyscirculatory encephalopathy (DE) and metabolic syndrome (MS) was studied.
There were 503 patients aged 45-89 years with DE enrolled into the study, who were divided into two groups: patients without MS (n=198) and with MS (n=305).
All patients were divided into three age subgroups.  All patients underwent clinical-neurological examination, laboratory tests, high resolution B-mode ultrasound examination, MRI.
Cognitive functions were assessed by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).
In middle age and elderly patients a significant inverse relationship between the total score of MMSE and the level of blood pressure, blood glucose level was found.
A direct significant correlation between blood pressure level and a total score of MMSE was revealed in senile patients.
The duration of hypertension significantly influenced on the severity of cognitive impairment in patients of middle and old age.
The results obtained indicate a definite relationship between the level of leptin in the blood of patients with MS and the state of their cognitive functions.
The influence of leptin level on cognitive function in patients with the metabolic syndrome increases with age.  Timely and adequate correction of blood pressure, blood glucose and triglycerides may have a positive effect on cognitive function in patients with MS.
