[Causal relationships in stroke and kidney injury].
AIM  To assess the frequency, severity, and causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with stroke.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
272 patients (143 men and 129 women) (mean age, 66.7±11.6 years) with stroke were examined.
The 2008 European Stroke Organization (ESO) guidelines were used to diagnose stroke, to determine indications for and contraindications to thrombolytic therapy, and to evaluate its efficiency.
Hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes (HS and IS) were diagnosed in 52 (19%) and 220 (81%) patients, respectively.
AKI was diagnosed and classified according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.
RESULTS
AKI was diagnosed in 89 (33%) patients: 19 (36.5%) with HS and 70 (31.8%) with IS.
The relative risk of death in patients with AKI-associated stroke was 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-4.0).
A poor outcome (the combined endpoint of death or Rankin scale scores of 4-5) was noted in 56 (62.9%) patients with AKI and in 70  (38.2 %) without AKI (χ2=14.6; p=0.0002).
The relative risk of a poor outcome in patients with AKI-associated with stroke was 1.64 (95% CI 1.3-2.0).
Forty-five (50.6%) patients with stroke developed AKI in the prehospital period.
CONCLUSION
AKI complicates stroke in every three patients and increases death rates.
50% of cases develop AKI in the prehospital period due to the common causes of stroke and AKI.
