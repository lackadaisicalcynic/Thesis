[ADVANCED AND SENILE AGE FOR THE FIRST DAYS AFTER X-RAY ENDOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS].  Research of the glomerular filtration rate at the patients of advanced and senile age who underwent X ray endovascular intervention is conducted.
Patients of age groups are examined: 34-59 years (49,7±7,8 years) - 35 people (group of control), 60-74 years (65,5±4,1) - 38 people and 75-82 years (77,5±2,5) - 12 people.
Methods of screening calculation of the glomerular filtration rate are compared.
The conclusion that regardless of techniques of definition of GFR and its initial level, the orientation of change of this parameter is characterized by its decrease at all patients after performance of coronary angiography, but more at patients of senile age group is drawn.
It is expedient to use Cockcroft-Gault's formula for screening determination of speed of the glomerular filtration rate at people of advanced and senile age, in particular in patients with ischemic heart disease when carrying out X-ray endovascular interventions.
