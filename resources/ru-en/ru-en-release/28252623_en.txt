[Associations between high levels of hostility and coronary heart disease in an open urban population among 25-64-year-old men].
AIM  To establish the associations of the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) with high levels of hostility in the open population of 25-64-year-old men in an average urbanized Siberian town.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was conducted in a representative sample of the electorate of a Tyumen administrative district among 1000 males, with 250 being in each of 4 life decades (25-34, 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64 years).
There were 850 (85%) responses.
Different forms of CHD were identified by standard methods (the WHO exertional angina questionnaire, resting EEG, and Minnesota coding) used in epidemiological surveys.
Definite CHD (DCHD) and possible CHD were identified.
A continuous survey method was used by self-filling out the WHO MONICA-psychosocial questionnaire to estimate the levels of hostility.
RESULTS
In an average urbanized Siberian town, the prevalence of high levels of hostility among 25-64-year-old men was 46.4% (age-adjusted rate).
The high levels of hostility increased with age, peaking in the 55-64-year-old group.
In the Tyumen male population aged 25-64-year-old, the odds ratio (OR) for coronary heart disease and high levels of hostility was 2.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.63-4.52 (p<0.05); that for DCHD was almost twice higher  (OR, 4.65; 95% CI, 2.14-10.12 (p<0.05).
In the older men aged 55-64 years, OR for coronary heart disease and high levels of hostility was 5.42; 95% CI, 2.32-12.66 (p<0.05); that for DCHD was 25.85; 95% CI, 3.30-202.60 (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION
Consequently, the epidemiological criteria for psychosocial risk factors, including hostility, which are detected by the standardized survey methods, should be used in prophylactic examinations of a male population and in the selection of able-bodied people with cardiovascular disease to be comprehensively examined and followed up.
