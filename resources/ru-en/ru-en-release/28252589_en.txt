[The relationship between the post-rhinoplastic functional disorders, the surgical approach and techniques, the magnitude and extent of the intervention].  The objective of the present study was to investigate the functional consequences of aesthetic rhinoplasty.
The functional outcome of the intervention was much better in the case of single-step rhinoseptoplasty than after the intranasal intervention (turbinoplasty, sinusotomy) based on the results of objective assessment (the total volumetric flow (TVF) 629±98 cub. cm/s and 397±65 cub. cm/s respectively; p<0.05).  It is concluded that the application of the structure-sparing tools during primary rhinoplasty, such as expandable grafts, extending flaps, and restorative transplants, can reduce the severity and the frequency of the functional disorders likely to develop during the long-term follow-up (TVF 550±85 cub. cm/s vs 303±50 cub. cm/s; p<0.05).
