[Neuroimaging of functional abnormalities in apathy].
Apathy is a common comorbid condition in neurologic and somatic disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, senile dementia, HIV) and a symptom of many psychiatric disorders.
Neurophysiologic research in this area aims to examine the specific features to differentiate the apathy from main disorder.  This paper reviews neuroimaging studies of functional abnormalities in apathy.
