[The use of extra-intracranial microanastomosis in the treatment of cerebral ischemia in patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage].  OBJECTIVE
to evaluate the use of extra-intracranial microanastomosis (EICMA) in the treatment of brain ischemia in patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
In the period from 01.01.14 to 01.07.15, there were 229 surgeries for ruptured intracranial aneurysms performed in the urgent surgery unit.  Nine patients with marked and widespread angiospasm, subcompensated and decompensated cerebral ischemia underwent the simultaneous clipping of ruptured intracranial aneurysms and EICMA.
The age of patients varied from 32 to 52 years (mean 36 years).
The severity of patient's state was assessed as III-IV grades on the Hunt and Hess scale before operation.
The surgery was performed 1-2 days after admission to the hospital, 1-8 days after the development of SAH.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Excellent and good outcome was recorded in 4 patients, severe disability in 3 patients, fatal outcome in 2 patients.
The fatal outcome was due to decompensated cerebral ischemia and progressive angiospasm with the high linear blood flow rate and the following reduction in perfusion in the affected hemisphere.  The simultaneous clipping of ruptured intracranial aneurysms and EICMA in the acute stage of SAH of patients with subcompensated cerebral ischemia allow to improve treatment
RESULTS  This technique is most applicable for patients with proximal angiospasm of M1- and M2-segments of the middle cerebral artery in the first 24 h of the development of a focal neurological deficit supported by the reduction in perfusion in the corresponding vascular area.
