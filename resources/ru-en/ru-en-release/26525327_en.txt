[The use of the method of photodynamic therapy for the treatment of the patients presenting with primary and recurrent laryngeal cancer].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the method of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of the patients presenting with primary and recurrent laryngeal cancer.
A total of 20 patients at the age from 46 to 82 (mean 61.3±7.5) years suffering from laryngeal cancer (17 men and 3 women) were available for the observation.
PDT was based on the use of «Atkus» lasers (Russia) operated at a wavelength of 662 nm and a power up to 3 W as well as «Lagus» lasers(wavelength: 662 nm, power: up to 3 W).
It was shown that the effective treatment of laryngeal cancer by PDT is possible under condition of the thorough selection of the patients with a definite growth type and localization of the tumour.  Complete resorption (CR) was achieved in 100% of the patients with the early (I-II) stages of laryngeal cancer and in 90% of those having exophyticneoplasms less than 1 cm in size.
Moreover, the beneficial effect of PDT was documented in the treatment of limited relapses of laryngeal cancer in tracheostoma following combined therapy.
It is concluded that the proposed method can be recommended for the palliative care in order to reach homeostasis in the patients with extended bleeding tumours and also for the reduction of their volume andrecanalization of the trachea to improve the patients' quality of life.
The authors maintain that PDT can be in many cases performed under the outpatient conditions.
