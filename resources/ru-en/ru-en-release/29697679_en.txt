[Hybrid repair of postoperative ventral hernia].  AIM
To develop new technique of abdominal wall repair for postoperative ventral hernia without disadvantages which are intrinsic for open and laparoscopic surgery.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Combined open and laparoscopic hernia repair was used in 18 patients with postoperative ventral hernia.  Open stage provided safe dissection of abdominal adhesions and defect closure by autoplasty, laparoscopic procedure consisted of prosthesis deployment without separation of abdominal wall layers.
Two types of composite endoprostheses with anti-adhesive coating were used for abdominal wall repair.
RESULTS
There were no cases of recurrence or infectious complications in long-term period (from 3 to 106 months).
CONCLUSION
Hybrid repair of postoperative ventral hernia is safe and effective procedure.
Further studies are necessary to assess cost-effectiveness ratio of this method in view of expensive composite endoprostheses and laparoscopic supplies.
