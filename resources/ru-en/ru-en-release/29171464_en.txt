[Impact of various wound dressings on wound bed neoangiogenesis in patients with different forms of diabetic foot syndrome].
AIM  To investigate the impact of various wound dressings on wound bed neoangiogenesis in patients with different forms of diabetic foot syndrome (DFS).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The clinical (local tissue oxygenation) and immunohistochemical (CD31) markers of foot soft tissue neoangiogenesis were evaluated in patients with DFS receiving negative pressure (NP) therapy and collagen-containing dressings (CCDs) versus standard treatment.
63 patients with neuropathic and neuroischemic (without critical ischemia) forms of DFS were examined after wound debridement.
In the postoperative period, 21 patients received NP treatment, CCDs were applied to 21 patients, and 21 patients had standard treatment.
RESULTS
During NP therapy, there was statistically significantly intensified local microhemodynamics, as evidenced by transcutaneous oximetry (p < 0.05); the remaining two groups showed no statistically significant differences in transcutaneous oxygen tension during the treatment.
Immunohistochemical examination revealed a significant increase in the number of newly formed vessels, as shown by anti-CD31 antibody staining (p < 0.05), in patients who had NP therapy and CCDs (p < 0.05).  CONCLUSION
Vacuum (NP) therapy versus standard therapy most effectively affects wound bed neoangiogenesis.  This is reflected in the increased local tissue microhemodynamics, as confirmed by immunohistochemical examination.
