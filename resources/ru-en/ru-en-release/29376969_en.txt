[The commonest therapeutic methods for laser irradiation of blood].  One of the most widely employed methods of laser therapy is laser irradiation of blood (LIB).
There are two modifications of this technique, one being intravenous low-intensity laser irradiation of blood (ILIB), the other non-invasive blood irradiation(NLIB).  The two methods have been developing independently since either has its advantages and disadvantages.
The present article was designed to review the main currently available techniques for laser irradiation of blood which are presented in the form of tables (charts).
Replacing the UV irradiation of blood with UV lamps by laser ultraviolet irradiation of blood (LUVIB®) has made it possible to significantly simplify the technique and enhanced its efficiency.
The most effective options for ILIB are the combined techniques: ILIB-635 + LUVIB® and ILIB-525 + LUVIB.
The most effective technique for ELIB is believed to be the use of low-intensity pulsed laser light with a wavelength of 635 nm and output power up to 40 W.
