[Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas.  A series of clinical cases and an analysis of the literature data].  Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (SDAVFs) are the most common vascular malformation of the spinal cord, causing segmental lesions of the spinal cord due to venous ischemia.
Functional outcomes of treatment in SDAVF patients are favorable, but the rate of improvement varies from 25 to 100%, which complicates prediction of the treatment outcome.
AIM  the study aim was to identify a relationship between fistula localization and clinical manifestations and evaluate the effect of disease duration and severity of neurological impairments on immediate and long-term treatment outcomes, based on analysis of the literature and own data.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In September 2016, we performed a PubMed search for publications using keywords 'spinal arteriovenous fistula', 'treatment', and 'outcome'.
We selected publications containing information on the patient's age, fistula location, disease duration, and evaluation of symptom severity (Aminoff-Logue scale) preoperatively, postoperatively, and at least 3 months after surgery.
The analysis also included data on patients operated on at the clinic.
A total of 187 patients were included in the analysis.
RESULTS
The fistula was most often located at the T6, T7, and T9 level, with motor disorders being more severe for fistulas located at or below the T9 vertebra.
Surgical isolation of the fistula improved the functional state of patients, with patients under the age of 60 years having a better prognosis for recovery of impaired functions.
Motor disorders significantly regressed in the early postoperative period in all patients, but in the long-term period, there was worsening of motor disorders in patients with a better baseline functional state.
