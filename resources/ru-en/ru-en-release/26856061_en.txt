[The expert observation of myocardial contusion in a child].  A case of the myocardial contusion associated with the closed blunt chest injury in the girl aged 1 year 7 months is presented.
The autopsy revealed hemorrhage of an irregular oval shape, coloured dark-red, and confined to the region with the area of 4.0 x 3.5 cm.  It penetrated throughout the entire thickness of the lower part of the left atrial myocardium and the upper and middle parts of the left ventricle.
No other changes were found in the heart, nor were congenital cardiac and vascular malformations documented.
The main factors playing an important role in the formation of the myocardium contusion are discussed.
The authors emphasize that it is the children having the narrow chest with the pliable wall who constitute the group at the highest risk of accidents resulting in the chest injury and myocardial contusion.
