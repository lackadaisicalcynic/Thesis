[The impact of octacalcium phosphate on the dynamics of bone matrix formation in experimental bone defects].  The aim of the study was to assess the interaction of of octacalcium phosphate (OCP) with bone matrix and cells and its impact on the process of bone generation.
In group 1 (6 animals) defect was left to heal under blood clot and in group 2 (6 animals) it was filled with OCP.  Three animals with no defect served as a control group.
It was showed significant (p<0.05) increase of the area of the newly formed bone tissue and its direct correlation with duration of observation.
