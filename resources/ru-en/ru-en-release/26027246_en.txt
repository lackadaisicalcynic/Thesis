[Familial partial lipodystrophy (Dunnigan syndrome) due to LMNA gene mutation: The first description of its clinical case in Russia].  Hereditary lipodystrophies (HLD) are a heterogeneous group of rare diseases characterized by a complete or partial loss of subcutaneous fat and by the development of metabolic disturbances: diabetes mellitus with obvious insulin resistance and acanthosis nigricans, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome.
The laminopathy variant familial partial lipodystrophy type 2 or Dunnigan syndrome (FPLD2) is the most common cause of partial LD.
The paper describes a family (3 clinical cases) with FPLD2 caused by heterozygous R482W missense mutations in the gene encoding the protein lamin A/C (LMNA; 150330).
This observation demonstrates that specialists should be more aware of this disease and make a timely diagnose in cases of concurrent severe metabolic disturbances at a young age, which contributes to more effective treatment of patients and to medical genetic counseling of their families.
