[Rationale for the choice of medication based on the conception of the pathogenesis of mental disorder and mechanism of drug action].
In modern medicine, when prescribing drugs it is customary to take into account the pathogenesis of the disease and the mechanism of action of drugs.

These data will contribute to the rapprochement of neurology and psychiatry with other medical specialties.
