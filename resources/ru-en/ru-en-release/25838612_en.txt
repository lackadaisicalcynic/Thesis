Legislation coverage for child injury prevention in China.
OBJECTIVE  To examine the extent to which effective interventions to prevent unintentional child injury are reflected in the laws and regulations of China.
METHODS
We focused on the six common causes of fatal child injuries - drowning, road traffic injury, falls, poisoning, burns and suffocation.  We investigated 27 interventions recommended by the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Health Organization or the European Child Safety Alliance.
We searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Lawyee for Chinese legislations using keywords and synonyms for the 27 interventions.  We reviewed the identified legislations for statements specifying the responsible implementation department.
FINDINGS  Seven national laws, nine regulations of the State Council and 46 departmental regulations were found to relate to at least one of the interventions.
Although seven of the 27 internationally recommended interventions were covered by Chinese laws, 10 were not covered by any current Chinese law or regulation.
None of the interventions against drowning and falls that we investigated was covered by national laws.
The implementation responsibilities for effective interventions were either not specified or were assigned to multiple governmental departments in 11 or 20 legislative documents, respectively.
CONCLUSION  In Chinese laws and regulations, interventions proven to prevent major causes of unintentional child injuries are underrepresented and the associated implementation responsibilities are often poorly defined.
China should include all such interventions in laws and regulations, and assign implementation responsibility for each to a single department of the national government.
