[Effects of saffron (Crocus sativus l. iridaceae) on blood level of follicle-stimulating hormone, and number and dynamics of body weight of offspring in female rats].  This paper reviews the effects of saffron Ð¡rocus sativus L. Iridaceae which grow in Azerbaijan on blood level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and number and dynamics of body weight of offspring in female rats.
The findings indicated that the per os administration of alcoholic extract of saffron was able to decrease the FSH levels in blood of the 12-month-old rats as compared to that in the control group, involving the animals of the same age which have not received the saffron extract, and was close to the FSH levels reported for the 6-month rats.
There was also an increase in number and body weight of pups from rats receiving the saffron extract prior to pairing with the intact males.
