[Brainstem auditory evoked potentials in neurophysiological assessment of brain stem dysfunction in patients with atherostenosis of vertebral arteries].
AIM
To assess brain stem dysfunction in patients with hemodynamically significant stenosis of vertebral arteries (VA) using short latency brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study group included 50 patients (mean age 64Â±6 years) with hemodynamically significant extracranial VA stenosis.  RESULTS
Patients with hemodynamically significant extracranial VA stenosis had BAEP abnormalities including the elongation of interpeak intervals I-V and peak V latency as well as the reduction of peak I amplitude.  After transluminal balloon angioplasty with stenting of VA stenoses, there was a shortening of peak V latency compared to the preoperative period that reflected the improvement of brain stem conductive functions.
CONCLUSION
Atherostenosis of vertebral arteries is characterized by the signs of brain stem dysfunction, predominantly in the pontomesencephal brain stem.
After transluminal balloon angioplasty with stenting of VA, the improvement of brain stem conductive functions was observed.
