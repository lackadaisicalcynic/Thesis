[The possibilities for the expert diagnostics of the injuries for the purpose of examination of the remains of the strongly burnt and carbonized corpses].  The objective of the present study was the analysis of the publications in the domestic and foreign literature containing the reports concerning the experience with forensic medical expertise of the strongly burnt and carbonized human corpses.
Flame is known to sometimes cause injuries simulating the intravital wounds.
Such injuries are categorized into the following types.  Thermal ruptures reminiscent of the classical stab and slash wounds unaccompanied by swelling and hemorrhage in the surrounding tissues.
Thermal epidural hematomas characterized, unlike traumatic hemorrhages, by the loose cellular structure, brown or reddish-brown colour, and localization at the convex surfaces of both hemispheres of the brain.
Thermal amputations differs from the intravital injuries in that they have the polished edges as well as the smoothed and rounded ends the bones bearing no residual soft tissues.  The morphological picture of the thermal fractures depends on the time and temperature of the thermal impact.
As a rule, the compact bone tissue separates into layers in both longitudinal and transverse directions with the formation of even cortical and through cracks of different length and width.
The comprehensive investigation of bone injuries accompanied by the alteration of their physical properties makes it possible to determine the type and the sequence of the combined (mechanical and thermal) actions.
The bone of the base of the skull and cervical vertebrae sometimes retain the signs of intravital mechanical injuries.  Post-mortem tomography provides an important accessory tool for the examination of the remains.
