[Endovascular intervention in central venous stenosis and obstructions in the middle aged and elderly hemodialysis patients: a Single-center Experience.]  Central vein stenosis and obstruction is one of the main risk factors in vascular access failure among hemodialysis patients.
The elderly patients are in a particularly group because of some problems of arteriovenous fistula creation and maintenance.
To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for the treatment of central vein stenosis and obstruction in the middle aged and elderly hemodialysis patients.  Forty eight hemodialysis patients with central vein stenosis and obstruction were treated from 2010 to 2016.
The patients were divided into two groups, younger 60 years (27 people) and older 60 years (21 people).
Fifty three vascular accesses were treated in common (the first group is twenty nine pieces, the second group is twenty one pieces).  The first group: the technical success was 85%, the primary patency rates were from 1 to 24 months with an average month of 7,7, the secondary patency rates were from 1 to 30 months with an average month of 11,2.
The second group: the technical success was 98%, the primary patency rates were from 4 to 13 months with an average month of 7,2, the secondary patency rates were from 1 to 49 months with an average month of 13.
There two complications, one in every group.
One case of unsuccessful left brachiocephalic vein recanalization was in the middle aged group.
The percutaneous interventions are effective and safety in central vein stenosis and obstruction among hemodialysis patients in all ages for saving hemodialysis vascular access for long period of time.
