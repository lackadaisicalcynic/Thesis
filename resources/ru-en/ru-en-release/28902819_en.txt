[Chronic venous diseases: valvular function and leukocyte-endothelial interaction, possibilities of pharmacotherapy].  This article provides a review of the literature focusing on the data elucidating the pathogenesis of chronic venous diseases from the positions of macrohaemodynamic (venous valvular function) and microcirculatory impairments.
Presented herein are confirmations of the interaction between two important mechanisms, as well as the literature data concerning the role of the venous microvalvular structures and possible haemodynamic impairments in functional venous insufficiency.
Also presented are substantiations in confirmation of the theory of leukocyte-endothelial interaction, forming the basis for contemporary understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic venous diseases.
This is followed by elucidating the role of venoactive drugs in conservative treatment of patients with chronic venous diseases, and, finally, touching upon current problems and promising approaches to solve them.
