Pulmonary embolism in the hospitalized patients 65+ in relation to presence of diabetes in 2007-2015.  The aim was to compare an occurrence of acute PE in hospitalized patients 65+ years old with diabetes mellitus (DM) with those without any DM.
It was a retrospective analysis of data collected in documentation of patients who were hospitalized at the geriatric department in the years 2007-2015.  In this period we had 11 947 patients of an average age of 79,9±8,5 years (min - 65, max - 103 years).
Out of this number there were 4 069 diabetics.  Acute PE was found in 344 patients of an average age 80,3±7,4 years. 121 of them died (35,3%) and 223 survived (64,7%).
From total patients 88 were diabetics with PE.  Mortality on PE did not influence the presence of DM.
She was the same in both groups of patients (p=NS) - with and without DM.  RESULTS
Prevalence PE in the hospitalized 65+ years old was 2,9%.
Mortality of PE among all the hospitalized 65+ was 1,0%.
Higher prevalence of PE was found in non-diabetics - 3,2%, as compared to the diabetics - 2,3% (p<0,025).
The average age of patients with diabetes both with and without PE was lower as compared to the non-diabetics (p<0,01).
Among risk factors we found significantly more frequently obesity in the diabetics as compared to the non-diabetics both surviving (p<0,001) and those who died (p<0,05).
The most important risk factor of PE was in all the patient's immobility.
One risk factor appeared in the set of survivors more frequently in the non-diabetics as compared to the diabetics (p<0,05).  Simultaneous occurrence of three risk factors appeared more frequently in the surviving diabetics (p<0,001) as compared to the non-diabetics.
Although overall presence of risk factors was higher in the diabetics, PE prevalence in the DM patients was lower as compared to the non-diabetics.
The immobility in general was the most important risk factor for PE occurrence, in the diabetics then also obesity.
