[A current view on dopamine receptor agonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease].  Dopamine receptor agonists (DRA) is a widely used group of antiparkinsonian drugs.
The article presents short results: related to the mechanism of the stimulation of different types of dopamine receptors.
The advantages of this group of drugs compared to levodopa medications as well as the studies of DRA in vitro and in vivo are described.
Multiple studies demonstrate an important role of DRA in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD): a good control of motor symptoms, the possibility of monotherapy in the early stages of disease, the reduced risk of motor complications compared to start therapy with levodopa and decrease in the duration of "OFF-period" and UPDRS scores as well as the possibility to reduce the dose of levodopa in case of combined treatment with levodopa containing preparations.
Pramipexole has demonstrated the efficacy in the treatment of persistent tremor and depression in double-blind placebo-controlled trials.
A significant improvement of quality of life index has been shown in PD patients treated with these drugs.
Side-effects often limited the use of DRA in clinical practice.  The data on the dose equivalence of different DRA are recommended to use if it is necessary to switch from one DRA to another.
