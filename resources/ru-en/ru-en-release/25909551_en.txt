[Damage of reconstructive operations in patients after urgent obstructive resection of colon].  It was performed comparative analysis of results of reconstructive operations in 116 patients with terminal colostomy after urgent obstructive resection of colon.
Damage of reconstructive operations which differ by only access was estimated.  Midline access was used in 49 patients, parastomal - in 51 cases.
The most traumatic method was middle laparotomy for restoration of colonic integrity.  Laparoscopic operations and parastomal access are less invasive.
Laparoscopic operations are accompanied by longer duration, greater blood loss and later restoration of intestinal motility pattern in comparison with surgery through parastomal access.  It is associated with duration and damage of adhesiotomy stage.
