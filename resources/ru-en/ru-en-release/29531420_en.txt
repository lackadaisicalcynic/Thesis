Knowledge integration in One Health policy formulation, implementation and evaluation.
The One Health concept covers the interrelationship between human, animal and environmental health and requires multistakeholder collaboration across many cultural, disciplinary, institutional and sectoral boundaries.  Yet, the implementation of the One Health approach appears hampered by shortcomings in the global framework for health governance.
Knowledge integration approaches, at all stages of policy development, could help to address these shortcomings.  The identification of key objectives, the resolving of trade-offs and the creation of a common vision and a common direction can be supported by multicriteria analyses.
Evidence-based decision-making and transformation of observations into narratives detailing how situations emerge and might unfold in the future can be achieved by systems thinking.
Finally, transdisciplinary approaches can be used both to improve the effectiveness of existing systems and to develop novel networks for collective action.  To strengthen One Health governance, we propose that knowledge integration becomes a key feature of all stages in the development of related policies.
We suggest several ways in which such integration could be promoted.
