[A role of interactions between N-methyl-D-aspartate and dopamine receptors in facial emotion recognition impairment in schizophrenia].  AIM
To search for genetic mechanisms of facial emotion recognition (FER) impairment, one of the features of schizophrenia that affects social adaptation of patients.
Based on the view implicating the interplay between dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, authors explored the interaction effects of the C366G polymorphism in the GRIN2B gene encoding NMDA receptor subunit NR2B with ANKK1/DRD2 Taq1A and 48-VNTR DRD4 polymorphisms on FER.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
GRIN2B -DRD2 interaction effects were studied in a sample of 237 patients and 235 healthy controls, GRIN2B - DRD4 in 268 patients and 208 controls.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Both effects were significant in combined samples of patients and controls (GRIN2B X DRD2, F=4.12, p=0.043; GRIN2B X DRD4, F=6.43, p=0.012).
Further analysis confirmed the interaction effect of GRIN2B and DRD2 polymorphisms on FER in patients with schizophrenia.
In patients with a less efficient allele of the DRD2 in the absence of the minor allele of the GRIN2B C366G polymorphism, the results were close to normal values while patients with minor alleles of both polymorphisms showed the worst results.
This finding is in line with the conceptions on a possible role of NMDA-receptor hypofunction and D2-mediated regulation of NMDA-receptor activity in FER impairments in schizophrenia.
