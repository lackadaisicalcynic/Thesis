[Possibilities of preventive treatment of tension-type headache in children and adolescents].
AIM  To study clinical characteristics mechanisms and pathogenesis of the tension-type headache (TTH) in children and adolescents treated with nooclerin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The blind randomized placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of nooclerin (deanol aceglumate) indicated during 2 months as a preventive treatment of TTH was performed.
Forty patients (15 male and 25 female), aged 9-16 years, were randomized into two equal groups to receive either nooclerin or placebo.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Nooclerin significantly reduced the frequency, duration and intensity of TTH.  The treatment resulted in positive dynamics in daily activities, regression of fatigue symptoms and normalization of the sleep-wake cycle.
