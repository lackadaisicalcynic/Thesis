[Role of genetic markers in personalization of anti-angiogenic therapy in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration].  The review presents data of clinical and pharmacogenetic research by Russian and foreign authors conducted within the last three years on the effectiveness of anti-angiogenic treatment against wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
Scientific results on the association between angiogenesis-related gene polymorphisms responsible for predisposition to AMD on the one hand and a positive response to anti-VEGF therapy on the other are presented.
Particular attention is paid to the main regulator of angiogenesis - the VEGF-A gene.
