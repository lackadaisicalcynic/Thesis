[The application of the lyophilized xenodermoimplants for the plastic correction of the external auditory canal and nasal septum perforation].
The objective of the present work was to improve the effectiveness of the treatment of atresia of the external auditory canal (EAC).  Atresia of external acoustic meatus is a result of a mechanical or thermal injury but can also develop after a surgical intervention for the removal of foreign bodies, benign and malignant tumours.
This condition is frequently associated with the narrowing and obliteration of EAC leading to the marked impairment of hearing despite preservation of the middle ear structures.  Plastic correction of the external auditory canal for the purpose of its broadening does not always produce the desired result.
To improve the efficiency of such intervention, we made use of the lyophilized xenodermoimplants based on porcine skin.
Such preparation were applied in 19 patients; patency of the external auditory canal was restored in 16 cases.
