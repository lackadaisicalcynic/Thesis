[Dynamics of eeg and psychophysiological indicators of acute poisoning neurotoxicants on the stage of rehabilitation on the background of different methods of treatment].
AIM  To evaluate the dynamics of functional activity of brain structures underlying cognitive functions in patients with encephalopathy due to poisoning with neurotoxicants on the stage of rehabilitation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-six patients were examined.
The main group consisted of 40 patients treated with intravenous injections with mexidol (n=10), combination of mexidol with non-pharmacological methods - mesodiencephalic modulation (MDM) (n=10), hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) (n=10) and the combination of MDM and HBO (n=10).
The comparison group included 16 people.
All patients underwent neurophysiological (EEG, auditory event-related potentials) and neuropsychological examinations.  RESULTS
Marked EEG changes were noted in all patients.
The domination of disturbances of functional activity on the diencephalic or mesodiencephalic levels was observed.  After treatment, positive changes were found in 60% of patients.
The positive dynamics was observed in 80% patients when the combination of mexidol, MDM and HBO was used.
The negative dynamics was noted in 5 (12,5%) of patients of the main group, in particular when mexidol only was used.
The results of the primary neuropsychological study revealed that cognitive impairment of different severity was found in 97,5% of patients of the main group and 100% of patients of the comparison group.
After treatment, performance on neuropsychological tests improved by 62,5%, N200 and P300 latencies reduced, while the amplitudes increased, in the patients of the main group.
CONCLUSION  The use of mexidol, MDM and HBO in the treatment of patients with encephalopathy due to poisoning with neurotoxicants on the stage of rehabilitation improved the indicators of functional brain activity and cognitive functions.
