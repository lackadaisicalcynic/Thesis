[Surgical treatment for fibro-muscular dysplasia].  AIM
To present the results of surgical treatment of patients with fibro-muscular dysplasia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Our experience of treatment of 144 patients with fibro-muscular dysplasia is presented in the article. 118 (82%) patients suffered from stenoses, kinking and aneurysms of internal carotid arteries, 21 (14.5%) patients had lesion of renal arteries, 5 (3.5%) patients--azygous visceral arteries lesion.
It was performed 157 reconstructive operations in the Department of cardiac surgery N(o)1 (aortic surgery) of acad.
B.V. Petrovskiy Russian Research Center for Surgery for the period from 1993 to 2014.
Clinical features of fibro-muscular dysplasia, surgical tactics and technique depending to the localization of lesion are described.
RESULTS  Immediate and remote surgical results were studied.
There were no any severe intraoperative and immediate postoperative complications.
Follow-up after carotid surgery was 104.49±68.68 months (6-247 months).
Strokes were not observed.
Hemodynamically insignificant re-stenoses were diagnosed in 7 (5.5%) cases.
Mean follow-up after renal reconstructions was 139.24±63.96 months (28-239 months).
Persistent blood pressure normalization was achieved in 11 (73.3%) cases.
Patients with azygous visceral arteries dysplasia have been examined for the period of 103.4±69.6 months (35-205 months).
There were no recurrent aneurysms and abdominal ischemia in the remote postoperative period.
Hospital and remote mortality was absent.
Based on own experience and colleagues' data we consider that surgical treatment of patients with some forms of fibro-muscular dysplasia provides satisfactory results if advisable strategy is selected.
