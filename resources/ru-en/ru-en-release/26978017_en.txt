[Prognostic values of the clinical, morphological and molecular biological characteristics of colon adenocarcinoma].  OBJECTIVE
to estimate the predictive and prognostic factors using morphological studies in patients with colon cancer to increase survival rates.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Immunohistochemical examination was made in 582 patients with colon adenocarcinoma, by determining 11 different indicators relating to the development of the tumor and its treatment.
RESULTS
The simultaneous determination of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and proliferative activity (Ki-67 expression) can define disease prognosis in view of relapse-survival rates in patients with Stage II colon cancer after radical surgical treatment.
CONCLUSION
Thymidylate synthase and thymidine phosphorylase are of predictive value.
The immunohistochemical examination of other markers, such as ALDH1, CCR10, ERCC-1, DYPD, topoisomerase II alpha, and class III beta-tubulin for the choice of treatment policy for patients with colon cancer has indicated that they are of no value.
