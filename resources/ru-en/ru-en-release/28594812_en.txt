[Staged implantation of an abdominal stent graft].  The article deals with a case report regarding successful surgical management of a patient presenting with an anatomically complicated aneurysm of the aortic infrarenal portion and iliac arteries.
The first stage consisted in performing implantation of the Ovation Prime stent graft into the abdominal aorta.
One month later, the second stage carried out for residual type IB endoleak consisted in implantation of the iliac components of the stent graft into the external iliac arteries on the right and the left.
The postoperative period turned out uneventful.
The findings of the check ultrasonographic examination showed no evidence of endoleak, with the stent graft's patency preserved.
The patient was discharged in a satisfactory condition.
The check multispiral computed tomography performed 30 days after the operation also demonstrated complete isolation of the aneurysm of the aorta and iliac arteries from blood flow, with the graft's being patent.
The presented herein clinical case report is of sporadic occurrence and is of practical importance for extending the indications for aortic endoprosthetic repair.
