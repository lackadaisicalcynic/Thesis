[Remote consequences of the long-term uncontrolled use of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs by elderly patients: cognitive disorders].
OBJECTIVE  Frequents cases (10-30% of the elderly population) of regular long-term use of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs, in particular, benzodiazepines, without control of the physician is an urgent problem of medicine worldwide.
Severe and irreversible cognitive impairment is a frequent and severe consequence of this use.
Authors studied cognitive impairment in these cases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Patients were enrolled in the study from a psychiatric hospital.
The study included 56 women, aged over 50 years, admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of a mental disorder.  Before admission, the patients regularly used benzodiazepines without a prescription for more than 2 months.
Later on, anxiolytics were withdrawn during 1-5 days.
The patients were studied during 4 weeks in the hospital.
To assess the severity and dynamics of their condition, authors used MADRS, HAM-A, MMSE.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Severe cognitive impairment, achieving the level of dementia, was found in 57.2% of the patients, mild or moderate of cognitive impairment was in 32.1% and only 10.7% had normal level of cognitive functioning.
After 4 weeks of benzodiazepine withdrawal, the percentage of patients with dementia reduced to 21.4%, the severity of cognitive impairment was estimated as mild or moderate.
A number of patients without cognitive impairment increased to 37.5%.
The old age of patients was a significant negative predictor of the dynamics.  An impact of the high anxiolytic dose was shown on trend level.
The duration of a mental disorder and duration of uncontrollable consumption of anxiolytics and hypnotics did not exert an effect on the development and reversibility of cognitive impairment.
A combination of anxiolytics with alcohol increased the risk of dementia and did not reverse the cognitive pathology.
