[Remote results of open surgical and endovascular treatment of internal carotid artery stenoses].  The article is a review containing a comparative analysis of the remote results in patients presenting with carotid artery atherosclerosis and treated by means of either stenting or carotid endarterectomy.
More than ten international randomized studies have up to now been conducted.  Some of them prove the advantage of using either carotid endarterectomy or stenting of carotid arteries, others show equivalence of both methods of treatment.
Carotid endarterectomy is currently a preferred operation for carotid artery stenoses, with lower incidence of the development of postoperative strokes and restenoses in the remote period.
But stenting is an alternative technique in patients with high operative risk.
Therefore, the question of choosing an appropriate type of the intervention should be decided upon for each patient individually.
A more definite conclusion to be made on advantages of carotid endarterectomy over endovascular angioplasty, or vice versa, requires further studying therapeutic outcomes during a longer follow-up period.
