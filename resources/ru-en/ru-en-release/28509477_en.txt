[Neurocomputer identification of order parameters in gerontology].  Investigation of distinctions discovered between three groups of different age female-khanty (indigenous population of Ugra, Russia) of five active components (from all 14 components registered) of a state vector of cardiovascular system shows the wrong solving binary classification problem in a five dimensional phase space by one iteration or a few iterations p (p≤50) using a neuroemulator.
We prove that solving binary classification problem by a neuroemulator must be repeated about 1 000 times since it provides identifying more significant diagnostic signs хi between two significant figures after comma which exhibit the significance in diagnostics of aging rate (this is system synthesis problem solving in gerontology).
