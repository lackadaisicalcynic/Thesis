[Investigations of the distribution of aripiprazole in the internal organs and biological fluids of the laboratory animals in case of acute intoxication].
Despite the present-day extensive application of aripiprazole, there are many cases of its overdose and of poisoning with this compound.
The objective of the present study was to detect and quantify aripiprazole in the internal organs and biological fluids of the laboratory animals in case of acute intoxication.  The experiments were carried out on white mice of both sexes weighing 20.5 and 25.7 g.
Aripiprazole was isolated from the liver, kidneys, brain, and heart as described by A.A. Vasil'eva and from the plasma and urine by the newly developed original methods.
Aripiprazole was identified and quantitatively determined in the extracts from the aforementioned organs and tissues with the use of HPLC.  The data obtained on the completeness of extraction from the liver, kidneys , and brain of the laboratory animals indicate that aripiprazole accumulated in the highest concentrations in the brain and kidneys within 24 hours after acute poisoning.
Ist content was significantly lower in the liver while no traces of aripiprazole were found in the heart of the mice.
The methods for aripiprazole isolation from the urine and blood plasma are described.
The maximum amounts of aripiprazole were detected in blood plasma within 24 hours after acute intoxication.
It is concluded that the proposed methods for aripiprazole isolation from the biological fluids (blood plasma and urine) can be included in the scheme of the chemical toxicological analysis of this compound.
