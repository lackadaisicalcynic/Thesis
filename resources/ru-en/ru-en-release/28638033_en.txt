[The biomarkers of cerebral ischemia as a new method for the validation of the efficacy of cytoprotective therapy].
AIM  To study blood plasma concentrations of NR2-peptide in patients with ischemic stroke (IS) to assess its diagnostic value as a biomarker of cerebral ischemia and determine the dynamics of the biomarker during treatment with cortexin.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and twenty patients, aged from 18 to 70 years, including 36 with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and 84 with IS in the carotid territory (n=70) and vertebral/basilar territory with the Wallenberg-Zakharchenko syndrome (n=14), were enrolled.
The National Institute of Health Stroke scale (NIHSS) was used to assess neurological status.
Blood plasma concentration of NR2-peptide was measured in all patients at admission and after treatment.  All laboratory results were compared with neuroimaging (MRI, CT) data.
RESULTS
Concentrations of NR2-peptide detected in all patients were higher than in controls (>1.5 ng/ml), p<0.0001.
The direct correlation between NR2-peptide (from 3.38 ng/ml to 15.6 ng/ml) and ischemic lesion (from few to 80 mm) was observed.
A decrease in NR2-peptide concentration (from 8.5 to 5,.9 ng/ml, p<0.0001) was noted in patients treated with cortexin after 10-day treatment course.  CONCLUSION
NR2-peptide blood assay is a reliable hemotest of brain ischemia.  Cortexin has a sufficient therapeutic efficacy.
