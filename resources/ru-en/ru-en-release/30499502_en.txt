[Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy].  Transthyretin family amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is a progressive, ultimately fatal disease.
It manifests itself primarily with sensory, motor and autonomic polyneuropathy and/or cardiomyopathy and is caused by extracellular deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils in the endoneurium.
The cause of TTR-FAP is the mutation in the gene encoding transthyretin, more than 100 types of mutations are known.
Given the phenotypic diversity of TTR-FAP, it is difficult for clinicians to make this diagnosis.
An erroneous diagnosis is a frequent occurrence, risking the onset of an organ pathology.
The paper addresses the issues of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of TTR-FAP.
