[The modern-day forensic medical aspects of the stab and slash injuries].
This article presents a review of scientific literature concerning investigations on the peculiar features of the stab and slash injuries.  It is shown that the currently available data provide a basis for the elucidation, with great probability, the specific group and narrow-group features characteristic of various types of pricking and piercing objects with which the stab and slash injuries are known to be inflicted.
The large variety of such objects (weapons) dictates the necessity to carry out further investigations.  One of the problems of special interest is to elucidate peculiar metric and morphological characteristics of the stab and slash injuries caused by the national Uzbek knives ('pichak').
