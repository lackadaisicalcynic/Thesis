[Mantle dentin as biomodel of materials for structural teeth restoration].
The article describes a structural element of natural teeth - mantle dentin.  It has been shown that the presence of this element in the structure of a natural tooth largely ensures its strength under the influence of repeated loads in a functional oral environment and arrests crack growth at the enamel/dentine interface.
This later effect is explained by the influence of a thin layer of mantle dentine, which has physical and mechanical characteristics different from that of the main dentin.
