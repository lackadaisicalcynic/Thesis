The problem of high disability and mortality due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from cerebral aneurysms has led to the fact that surgical treatment of unruptured aneurysms has been considered in Western Europe, Japan, and the United States as a method for prevention of subarachnoid hemorrhage for many years.
