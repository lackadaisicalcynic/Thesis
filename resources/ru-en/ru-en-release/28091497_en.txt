[Hyperprolactinemia associated with neuroleptic treatment: clinical characteristics and an impact on sexual function].
AIM
To study clinical characteristics of antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia (AIH) and an impact of AIH on sexual function in patients with mental disorders treated with neuroleptics for a long time.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A cross-sectional study of 244 consecutive psychiatric in-patients (F/M=140/104) with mental disorders currently taking antipsychotics was carried out.
The patients were screened for serum prolactin, sex hormones and gonadotropin levels.  The UKU Side effects rating scale (UKU) was used to assess side-effects.
For assessment of sexual dysfunction, the Psychotropic-Related Sexual Dysfunction Questionnaire (PRSexDQ) was administered.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Asymptomatic AIH was found in 16% of females and in 37% of males.
AIH caused menstrual disorders (oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea), galactorrhea in females.  AIH was associated with libido decrease and life quality impairment due to sexual dysfunctions in patients of both genders.
AIH was associated with orgasm delay and vaginal dryness during sexual intercourse in females.
In men, AIH was associated with erectile dysfunction.
In contrast to pituitary tumor and idiopathic hyperprolactinemia, there was no association between AIH and weight gain and/or obesity, and hypogonadism in patients of both genders.
