[The phenomenon of ischaemic postconditioning of the heart.  Analysis of clinical data].
Data concerning the effectiveness of ischaemic postconditioning (IPost) in treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are controversial.
The authors of the majority of studies have reported an anti-apoptotic and infarct reducing effect of IPost.  There is evidence that IPost reduces the microvascular obstruction zone, increases coronary flow reserve, and improves the pumping functions of the heart.
At the same time, there are publications reporting that IPost does not influence the course of acute STEMI.
It was established that IPost protects the heart from reperfusion injury occurring after cold cardioplegia in patients with tetralogy of Fallot.
