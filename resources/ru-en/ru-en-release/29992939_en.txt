[Complex rehabilitation of children with congenital cleft lip and palate at stomatological treatment stages].
Congenital malformations of the maxillofacial area - congenital cleft lip and palate (CCLP) due to their frequency, the severity of anatomical and functional disorders, the difficulty of social adaptation of patients, economic aspects are one of the most important problems of medicine.  It is established that for timely stage surgical treatment of children with IAPC the emphasis is on the somatic status of the child, anti-infective resistance, the ability to safely tolerate surgery, which is important for the restoration of anatomical defects, communication functions and psychosomatic health.
Children with CCLP are at risk for increased occurrence of postoperative complications, since upper respiratory tract infection and exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract diseases and ENT organs is a contraindication to surgical intervention.
The study of immune status revealed deep violations of antiviral and antibacterial immunity in children with CCPC aged from 6 to 12 years.
A program of combine interferon- and immunotherapy has been created.  Positive clinical and immunological efficacy of combine interferon-(gel Viferon - recombinant IFNÎ±2b in combination with antioxidant) and immunotherapy in the rehabilitation of children with CCPC aged 6 to 12 years was demonstrated.
