[The role of lipid metabolism disorders, atypical isoforms of protein kinase C, and mutational status of cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of isocitrate dehydrogenase in carcinogenesis of glial tumors].
The relationship between molecular genetic and metabolic disorders is one of the challenges of modern oncology.  In this review, we consider lipid metabolism and its changes as one of the factors of oncogenesis of glial tumors.
Also, we demonstrate that the genome and the metabolome are interconnected by a large number of links, and the metabolic pathways, during their reorganization, are able to drastically affect the genetic structure of the cell and, in particular, cause its tumor transformation.  Our own observations and analysis of the literature data allow us to conclude that mass spectrometry is a highly accurate current method for assessing metabolic disorders at the cellular level.
The use of mass spectrometry during surgery allows the neurosurgeon to obtain real-time data on the level of specific molecular markers in the resected tissue, thereby bringing intraoperative navigation techniques to the molecular level.
The generation of molecular fingerprints for each tumor significantly complements the available neuroimaging, molecular genetic, and immunohistochemical data.
