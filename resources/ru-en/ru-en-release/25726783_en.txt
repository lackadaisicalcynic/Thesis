[Reactivity of perineuronal astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia: an ultrastructural morphometric study].  OBJECTIVE
Previously the ultrastructural alterations of astrocytes have been reported in schizophrenia.  Reduced dendritic arborization of the neurons in layer 5 of the prefrontal cortex has been found in schizophrenia.
Authors hypothesized that the abnormalities in perineuronal astrocytes (PA) might contribute to these neuronal changes.  It was aimed to study the ultrastructure of PA in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Postmortem electron microscopic morphometric study of PA was performed in layer 5, area 10 of the prefrontal cortex in 39 cases of schizophrenia and 37 controls.
RESULTS
No significant group differences were found in areas of cell, nucleus, cytoplasm, volume fraction (Vv) of lipofuscin granules and areal density of PA.
However, in the subgroup of women with schizophrenia, the areal density of PA was significantly lower and the area of PA was significantly higher as compared to the subgroup of healthy women (-52%, p<0,01; +32%, p<0.05 respectively) and to the subgroup of men with schizophrenia (-56%, p<0,01; +23%, p<0,05 respectively).
The area of PA nucleus was negatively correlated with the duration of disease (r= -0.37, p=0.02) and positively with the age of disease onset (ADO) (r=0,47, p<0,01). Areas of PA and of PA nucleus were significantly lower in early ADO (<21 y.o.) as compared to the adult ADO (>21 y.o.) (-24%, p<0.05). Vv of lypofuscin granules was correlated with the age in control group (r=0.52, p=0.001), but not in schizophrenia group (r=0.13, p=0.4).
CONCLUSION
Significant differences in PA reactivity in the prefrontal cortex in the schizophrenia are associated with gender and age at onset of the disease.
