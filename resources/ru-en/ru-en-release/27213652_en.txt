[The comparative analysis of the clinical and morphological picture of the various forms of chronic suppurative otitis media].
We present the results of the surgical treatment of 300 patients presenting with chronic suppurative otitis media.  The changes in the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity were revealed in 61% of the patients with mesotympanitis while spreading cholesteatoma occurred in 48% of the cases of «dry» perforations.
The cholesteatomic process was documented in 64% of the patients with epitympanitis, the remaining patients presented with the pyo-carious process.
The efficiency of the surgical intervention on the «dry» ear of the patients with the tubotympanic form of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) amounted to 91.4% compared with 85% in the case of the altered mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity, 85.5% and 92.9% in the patients with the pyo-carious and cholesteatomic forms of the tympano-antral lesions, respectively.
Residual cholesteatomas were found in 7.8% of the patients suffering from epitympanitis during the three year follow-up period.
It is concluded that the results of clinical and morphological observations taken together with intraoperative findings give reason to consider mesotympanitis to be a prognosticallyunfavourable form of chronic suppurative otitis media.
