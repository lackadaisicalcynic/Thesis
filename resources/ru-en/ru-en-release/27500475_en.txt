[The classification of the injuries inflicted to the human body by gunshots from the pneumatic weapons].  UNLABELLED
The classification of the injuries inflicted to the human body by gunshots from the pneumatic weapons remains to be developed.  The objective of the present work was to elaborate the classification of the injuries caused by gunshots from the pneumatic weapons based on the analysis of 98 expert
and acts of forensic medical expertises (surveys) of living subjects (n=76) and corpses (n=22) affected by gunshots from the pneumatic weapons.  These materials were collected from the bureaus of forensic medical expertise in different regions of the Ukraine during the period from 2006 till 2015.
In addition, scientific publications concerned with the problem of interest were used along with the relevant explanatory and terminological dictionaries.  The terminology and the conceptual framework proposed by the author in the earlier papers provided a basis for the development of the first standard classification of the injuries inflicted to the human body by gunshots from the pneumatic weapons categorized into 15 groups.
It is believed that this classification will lay the foundation for the common approach of forensic medical experts to the examination and analysis of the data on the gunshots from the pneumatic weapons used to be found on the bodies of living subjects and the corpses.  Moreover, it may be useful for the clinicians in their diagnostic and therapeutic practices and for the legal practitioners engaged in the quality assessment of the results of forensic medical expertises.
It is recommended to present information about the gunshots from the pneumatic weapons in the accounting documents in a separate line.
