[Consequences of specific language impairment in children].
AIM  To assess cognitive and emotional disorders in children of primary school age who have a history of specific language impairment (SLI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty-six children, aged 7-9 years, who were previously studied at age of 3-6 years with a diagnosis of SLI with a predominant disorder of expressive speech, were examined.
Common neurological examination, psychological and psychometric testing were performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Clinical manifestations of the developmental disorder of expressive speech of moderate degree remained in 19.8% of children.  In 53.4% of cases, the state of children could be regarded as an organic asthenic disorder.
Clinical manifestations of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) were observed in 24.4% of children.
Disorders of the formation of school skills were revealed in 32.5% of children.  Thus, the SLI play an important role in the formation of cognitive, emotional and regulatory disorders and can serve as predictors of the development of other neuropsychiatric diseases.
