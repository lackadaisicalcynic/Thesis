Peer-led active tuberculosis case-finding among people living with HIV: lessons from Nepal.  PROBLEM
People living with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have a high risk of tuberculosis and should undergo regular screening.  However, they can be difficult to reach because they are stigmatized and discriminated against.
APPROACH
In Nepal, the nongovernmental organization Naya Goreto implemented a peer-led tuberculosis screening project in which people living with HIV volunteered to contact others in this high-risk population.
Volunteers took part in a short training course, after which they attempted to contact people living with HIV through existing networks and self-help groups.  Tuberculosis screening and testing were carried out in accordance with national guidelines.
LOCAL SETTING
In Nepal, the prevalence of HIV infection is 0.3% in the general population but is much higher, at 6%, in people in Kathmandu who inject drugs.  To date, the health system has not been able to implement systematic tuberculosis screening in people living with HIV.
RELEVANT CHANGES  Between May 2014 and mid-September 2015, 30 volunteers screened 6642 people in 10 districts, 5430 (82%) of whom were living with HIV.
Of the 6642, 6046 (91%) were tested for tuberculosis and 287 (4.3%) were diagnosed with the disease, 240 of whom were HIV-positive.  Of those with tuberculosis, 270 (94%) initiated treatment.
LESSONS LEARNT  Using peers to contact people living with HIV for tuberculosis screening resulted in a high participation rate and the identification of a considerable number of HIV-positive tuberculosis patients.
Follow-up during treatment was difficult in this highly mobile group and needs more attention in future interventions.
