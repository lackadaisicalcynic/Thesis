[The results of cochlear implantation in the patient with hereditary and non-hereditary hearing loss].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation of the patients after cochlear implantation in the early and late periods after operation taking into consideration the etiology of congenital deafness.
The comprehensive clinico-audiological examination performed during the period from 2010 to 2015 involved 246 children who had undergone cochlear implantation (CI).
All children were operated at the National Research Center for Audiology and Hearing Rehabilitation in the period from 2003 to 2013.
83 (56%) patients were aged 1 to 3 years at the time of surgery.
Their age varied from 3 to 18 years when they underwent the clinico-audiological examination.  Thus, the study is based on the experience with cochlear implantation varying from 3 to 12 years.
The genetic analysis revealed mutations in the GJB2 gene in 49% of the children, in agreement with the data of earlier studies.
85% of all the children with GJB2 deafness surgically treated at the age under 4 years attend ordinary institutions of learning.
Within 24 months after the onset of the observations the majority of the children with hereditary deafness (63%) were referred to the groups with good and excellent results of the rehabilitation and only 6 (12%) patients presented with unsatisfactory results.
It was shown that the acquired causes of the loss of hearing including severe prenatal pathology have a negative influence on the long-term outcomes of rehabilitation.
The results of the genetic analysis for the elucidation of the cause of impaired hearing can be employed as a prognostic criteria not only for the prediction but also for the guarantee of the success of cochlear implantation provided the rehabilitative process was initiated in a proper time.
