[Cytophlavin inclusion in complex treatment of diabetic foot syndrome with signs of lower limb blood vessels medicalcinosis].  The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cytoflavin inclusion in therapy regimens of patients with diabetic foot syndrome and medicalcinosis on the microcirculation of the lower limb blood vessels.
For this purpose, 64 patients with type II diabetes mellitus (subcompensated form), diabetic foot syndrome and signs of medicalcinosis foot blood vessels of various severity were examined.
All patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the therapy scheme: patients of group I (33 people) received insulin, antibiotics, disaggregants, statins, anti-inflammatory drugs, painkillers, detoxification therapy.
Patients of group II (31 patients) in addition to the main therapy received cytoflavin according to the scheme: 10 ml per 0.9 ml NaCl 200 ml intravenously, drip at a rate of 60 cap/min, 10 days course, then 2 tablets 2 times a day for 1 month.
The severity of the microangiopathy of the lower extremities was assessed considering transcutaneous oximetry data in dynamics (before treatment, on the 10th and 40th day of therapy) gained using TCM-2 device (RADIOMETER, Denmark) with has heating oxygen electrode type Clarc.
Before the treatment subcompensated level of metabolic disorders corresponding to the II degree of microcirculatory disorders was registered in all patients.
Against the backdrop of cytoflavin inclusion in the complex therapy, there was an improvement in the metabolic rate (up to compensated) with a decrease in the degree of microcirculation disorders up to I degree.
Positive dynamics of metabolic disorders significantly reduced frequency and extent of surgical interventions.
The results obtained suggest that cytoflavin should be included in the treatment regimens of patients with this pathology.
