[Morphofunctional characteristics of erythrocytes as target cells in the processes of early aging].  The article describes the morphofunctional characteristics of erythrocytes in clinical models of early aging (essential hypertension, coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus) by the original clinical and cytomorphological material.
It is shown that in the processes of aging and early aging following effects take places: the changing of the shape and size of cells, cell-cell interactions are broken, changing the elasticity of the cell membrane is changing too and cellular destruction is promoted.
