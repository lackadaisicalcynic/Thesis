[Results of malignancy detection during prophylactic medical examinations in 2013-2014].
AIM  To analyze the efficiency of prophylactic medical examination for malignancies that considerably contributes to adult mortality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The data of the national health statistics (Form 131/o, 7, 35) were used to make an expert analytical assessment of the results of prophylactic medical examinations for cancer in certain adult population groups in Russia in 2013-2014.
RESULTS
Medical examinations covered 20.5 and 22.5 million people in 2013 and 2014, respectively.
The proportion of 21-36-, 39-60-, and over 60-year olds was 36, 42, and 22%, respectively.
All the age groups showed a preponderance of women with their larger proportion in the older age groups (55, 58, and 64%, respectively).
In 2013 and 2014 there were 27,173 and 34,638 detected patients with malignances, including 17,095 (62.9%) and 20,944 (60.5%) women and 10,078 (37.1%) and 13,694 (39.5%) men, respectively.
In these years, the breast (28 and 30.5%), prostate (13.9 and 18.5%), rectum (6.5 and 7.5%), stomach (6.3% and 7.8%), lung (6.1 and 7.3%) ranked fifth in cancer sites.
There was a 17.6% increase in the detection rate of malignancy among the first identified patients during prophylactic medical examinations and and a 10.2% increase among all actively detected patients in 2014 versus 2013.
The older age groups exhibited a rise in cancer detection rates, the most significant (11.8%) increase being in the women older than 60 years of age.
CONCLUSION
The malignancy detection rates were noted to be on the rise, although there are defects in organizing prophylactic medical examination, ensuring the complete scope of necessary investigations, and interpreting the findings.
The measures methodically supported a by regional cancer may provide a guide to solving these problems.
At the same time, efforts are needed to actively attract citizens in the participation in prophylactic medical examination and in the development of behavioral attitudes associated with the higher responsibility for maintaining personal and public health.
