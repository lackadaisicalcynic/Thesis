[The results of endoscopic gastroduodenal, enteral and colorectal stenting for blastomatous stenosis: 8-year experience].  INTRODUCTION
Gastroduodenal, enteral and colorectal stenting of blastomatous stenosis is a reasonable alternative to operative treatment of unresectable tumors.  Moreover in some cases it allows to gain time and to prepare the patient for radical surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period from 2007 to 2015 in endoscopic department of acad.
B.V. Petrovskiy Russian Research Center for Surgery 76 patients with piloroduodenal, enteral and colic stenoses successfully underwent self-expanding metal stents installation.
There were 21 patients with malignant stenosis of the stomach and pilorobulbar area, 17 with secondary duodenal stenosis, 17 after gastrectomy and distal gastric resection; 2 with stenosing colorectal cancer, 4 patients with rectal cancer involving rectosigmoid junction, 7 with rectosigmoid junction cancer and 8 with sigmoid cancer.
RESULTS
Ambulatory and hospital interventions were performed in 35.5% and 64.5% of cases respectively.  Hospital-stay did not exceed 2 days.
The total complication rate was 11.8% (9/76), 3 of 9 patients required surgical intervention.
The attention is given to important technical aspects of intervention as well as to those clinical situations when stenting is inappropriate because of absence of favourable functional outcome.
CONCLUSION
Stenting should be more actively implemented in clinical practice, especially in emergency surgical hospitals.
However it requires adequate technical support of hospitals with different endoprostheses, because it provides simultaneous diagnostic survey and remedial procedure.
