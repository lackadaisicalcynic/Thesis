[Platelet functional activity in clinically healthy elderly].  The article contains the results of a study platelet aggregation in carefully selected clinically healthy elderly.
The study was performed on 121 clinically healthy elderly people, leading a healthy lifestyle, and do not have metabolic, cancer and cardiovascular disease.
We surveyed people between 61 and 74 years showed a significant weakening of antioxidant protection and increasing in platelet levels in their lipid peroxidation.
Platelet aggregation in vitro with a variety of inducers in the elderly showed age-dependent gain.  With increasing age in clinically healthy studied in vivo also noted a gradual increase in platelet aggregation.
This led them to increase the blood levels of the active forms of platelets and the number of circulating aggregates of different sizes.  There is reason to believe that revealed for the elderly increased activity of platelets in combination with the increase of subclinical disease, the progression of the aging process throughout the body and the effects of adverse environmental factors are important in the formation of conditions for increasing the risk of manifestation of cardiovascular disease.
