[The importance of handprint morphometry for determining the human body length].  Handprint morphometry for the purpose of personality identification still remains a relatively novel approach.
The methods employed for the measurements are not infrequently difficult to reproduce and therefore cause controversy.
The objective of the present study was to introduce the system of methods for the measurement of handprints suitable for the reliable determination of the human body length.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included the measurement of the size of 40 handprints left by124 adult subjects (52 men and 72 women).
Two methods of the regression analysis, stepwise and forced inclusion, were applied to the combined group of handprints to select the equations with the high (R>0.800) coefficients of multiple correlation with the body length.
RESULTS
13 equations of multiple regression were obtained and analyzed.  The standard error of estimating (SEE) varied from 4.30 to 5.19 cm.
The best results were obtained with the equations constructed from the sizes I, II, and III of the rays without their distal phalanges.
It was shown that the body length can be successfully reconstructed within the height range from 168 to 183 cm for men and from 157 to 176 cm for women.
The examples of the use of the equations for the purpose of expertise of illegible and incomplete handprints are presented.
