[The state of the larynx in the patients presenting with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical state of the larynx and its microbial population in 49 patients examined at the stage of stable condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Examination of the larynx was carried out with the use of a rigid laryngoscope having a visual angle of 70 degrees, videofibrolaryngoscopy, and stroboscopy using a «TelePac» videocomplex (Karl Storz, Germany).
The acoustic analysis of the voice was performed with the help of the Specta PLUS computer program.
It was shown that more than 70% of the examined patients presented with various forms of chronic laryngitis.  Potentially pathogenic St. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi C. albicans were isolated from 59% and 29% of the patients respectively.
