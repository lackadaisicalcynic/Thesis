PURPOSE  To study the effects of long-term instillation of 0.18% sodium hyaluronate artificial tears VISMED multi on ocular surface in glaucomatous patients with long-term instillation of preserved anti-glaucoma drops.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 79 patients (40 female and 39 male; 79 eyes in total) with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) divided into 3 groups according to disease stage: mild or early (stage I) glaucoma - 15 patients (15 eyes), moderate (stage II) glaucoma - 30 patients (30 eyes), advanced or severe (stage III) glaucoma - 34 patients (34 eyes).
Conjunctival and corneal changes were assessed with Norn's test, Schirmer I test and corneal fluorescein staining test.
All patients completed Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire.
Corneal compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc) was measured using Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA) (Reichert Optics Inc., USA). In addition to hypotensive therapy, all patients received instillations of 0.18% sodium hyaluronate (VISMED multi) three times every day.
After 14 days, all examinations were repeated.
RESULTS
The condition of eye surface in patients with moderate and advanced (stage II and III) glaucoma depends on the degree of IOPcc compensation.
As glaucoma increases in severity, the pathological changes in the ocular surface progress.
Instillations of 0.18% sodium hyaluronate solution lead to significant improvement of the test results in all groups, and in early glaucoma patients it restores all objective indicators to normal values.
CONCLUSION
Treatment with 0.18% sodium hyaluronate solution (VISMED multi) leads to statistically significant (p<0.05) improvement of ocular surface condition in glaucoma patients with long-term instillation of preserved antiglaucoma eye drops.
