[The role of pre-stroke cognitive disorders in the formation of post-stroke cognitive impairment].
AIM  To identify pre-stroke cognitive disorders and assess their influence on the post-stroke neuropsychological status of the patient.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 103 patients in an acute state of ischemic stroke in the carotid system.
Cognitive functions were assessed with MoCA and IQCODE.
All patients are evaluated for the presence of vascular risk factors and their relationship to the cognitive impairment.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
According to the MoCA, 89 (86.4%) patients in the acute state of ischemic stroke had cognitive impairment of varying severity.
Out of 103 patients, 55 (53.4%) had cognitive impairment prior to onset of stoke, mostly of mild severity.  Among the main risk factors that correlated with the presence of pre-stroke cognitive impairment were age, heart rhythm disturbances and heart failure.
