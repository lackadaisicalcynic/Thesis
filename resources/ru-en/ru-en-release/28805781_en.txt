[Surgical treatment of hip subluxation and luxation in children with spinal hernia consequences].
AIM
To determine surgical tactics for hip subluxation and luxation in children with spinal hernia consequences.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study included 134 patients with hip subluxation and luxation with consequences of cerebrospinal hernias who were examined at the Turner Research Institute for Children's Orthopedics in 2006-2016.
The main group consisted of 69 patients who received surgical treatment with hip joint stabilization.
The control group included 65 children without surgery.
Within each group patients were divided into 2 subgroups depending on level of spinal cord injury by using of Sharrard technique.
RESULTS
In patients with high lesion (Th and LI-LII) surgical treatment led to impairment of motor function in most cases (71%) (archival material); in case of LIII-LIV and LV-SI segments 25 of 45 (55%) patients improved motor performance while in control group motor function was deteriorated in 13 of 35 (37%) cases.
CONCLUSION
Neurosegmental level allows to predict the motor function and to determine surgical tactics.
