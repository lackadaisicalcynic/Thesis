[Management of post-sternotomy mediastinitis in cardiac patients].
Post-sternotomy mediastinitis is a severe complication of cardiac surgery and accompanied by high mortality and cost of treatment.  To date, there are no large clinical trials defining treatment of these patients.
In this study the authors offer early postoperative wound sanitation, use of vacuum drainage in all cases and surgical repair with local tissues.
Sternal destruction is cured by osteosynthesis with wire sutures and perforated metal plates.  Proposed algorithm showed low incidence of reccurent wound infection, mortality and duration of treatment.
