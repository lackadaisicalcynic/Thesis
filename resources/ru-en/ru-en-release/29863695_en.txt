[The features of psychopharmacotherapy of depressive states with panic attacks].
AIM  To develop therapeutic programs for treatment of depression with panic attacks on the basis of their clinical and psychopathological features.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 100 in- and outpatients, aged from 18 to 60 years, with depression of mild and moderate severity with panic attacks were studied.
The investigation was carried out using clinical, psychopathological and psychometric (the Atypical Depression Diagnostic Scale (ADDS), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales (MADRS), and the Sheehan Anxiety Rating Scale (ShARS)) methods.
The patients were assessed on admission, on the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 8th weeks with subsequent processing and defining standard indicators.
Three therapeutic groups were formed: the 1st group received therapy combining an antidepressant and a tranquilizer; the 2nd group an antidepressant, a tranquilizer and a mood stabilizer; and the 3rd group an antidepressant, a tranquilizer and an antipsychotic agent.
The time course of expression of the signs of depression, anxiety and frequency of panic attacks was analyzed.
RESULTS
The highest efficacy in the form of reduced signs of depression and anxiety was observed in the 3rd group on the 1st week of therapy.  No significant differences in reduction of depression and anxiety were found between the 1st and 2nd groups.
In the 1st therapeutic group, there was an increase in the frequency of panic attacks together with the reduction in their expression and decrease in the severity of depression as compared to the 2nd and 3rd groups.  At the same time the 3rd therapeutic group was characterized by a maximally expressed decrease in the frequency of panic attacks already on the 1st week of therapy.
CONCLUSION
The study has shown that the use of antipsychotic drugs in addition to therapy with antidepressants and tranquilizers is the most effective way to stop depression.
