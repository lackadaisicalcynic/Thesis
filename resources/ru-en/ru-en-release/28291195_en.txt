[Optic nerve pathology in the structure of diagnostic errors inpatients referred for cataract surgery].  AIM
to study the frequency of misdiagnosis of cataract in patients with optic nerve pathology or amblyopia and to identify its main causes.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study enrolled 381 patients (381 eyes) wrongly diagnosed with cataract.
A standard set of eye tests was performed.
In-depth examination of the macular area was done through biomicroscopy with contactless aspheric lenses of 60 and 90 D. Part of the patients underwent optical coherence tomography and static perimetry as well as examination of electrical sensitivity threshold and electrical lability of the optic nerve.
RESULTS
In 190 patients (190 eyes - 49.9%), the true cause of central vision impairment was optic nerve pathology associated with its partial atrophy of different origins: vascular (77.8%) or post-traumatic (22.2%).
Glaucomatous atrophy of the optic nerve was found in 175 patients within the age range from 57 to 70 years (175 eyes - 45.9%).
These were newly diagnosed cases of advanced open-angle glaucoma.
In 16 eyes (4.2%), the true cause of low vision appeared to be amblyopia of some type: strabismic (9 eyes - 56.3%), refractive (4 eyes - 25%), or mixed (3 eyes - 18.7%).
CONCLUSION
The main diagnostic errors of attending ophthalmologists were the following: underestimation of the discrepancy between low visual functions and small degree of lens opacity as well as the neglect of careful examination of the fundus (specifically, the optic disc and macula), additional perimetry, thorough history taking, and cover-testing for suspected amblyopia.
