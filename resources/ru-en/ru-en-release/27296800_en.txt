[Long-term survival in working-age patients after cerebrovascular accident].
AIM  To assess the long-term survival in working-age patients after cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and to define basic medical and social factors determining the survival rates.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  A continuous retrospective study included 756 working-age patients (<60 years) after CVA.
The life-table method and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to calculate a survival rate.  RESULTS
The highest risk of death was observed in the first year of CVA.  One-year survival after CVA was 81.7%, falling to 74.7% at 3 years and to 57.9% at 7 years.
The five-year survival was lower among men (60%) compared to women (74.5%).
The figures were higher in working population compared to non-working population (78% vs. 56%, respectively).
Long-term survival rate depends on the type of CVA: the five-year survival rate after unspecified stroke was 83.0%, after ischemic stroke - 69.0%, after hemorrhagic stroke - 43.0%.
The direct dependence between long-term survival and patient age has been identified: older patients have worse long-term prognosis.
CONCLUSION
The seven-year survival rate in working-age patients after cerebrovascular accident was 58%.
The health and social factors affecting the long-term survival rates in working-age patients are as follows: hemorrhagic stroke, unemployment, male gender and advanced age.
