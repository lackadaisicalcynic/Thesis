[Association of ITGB3, P2RY12, and CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms with platelet functional activity in patients with coronary heart disease during dual antiplatelet therapy].  AIM
To assess the association of CYP2C19 G681A, P2RY12 H1/H2, and ITGB3 T1565C polymorphisms with the extent of platelet aggregation in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) during antiplatelet therapy.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
166 male patients with CHD, living in the Western Siberian Region, were examined.
All the patients underwent a test for platelet aggregation induced by ADP (2.5 and 5.0 µm) and epinephrine (0.2 µm).
Genotyping was performed using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction technique.
RESULTS
The polymorphic variants of the P2RY12 and ITGB3 genes were ascertained to have no impact on the extent of platelet aggregation in patients receiving clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid.
An association was found between CYP2C19 681A allele carriage and the increased extent of platelet aggregation induced by ADP.
CONCLUSION
The carriage of the cytochrome P450 CYP2C19 681A allele rather than platelet receptor gene polymorphisms determines a risk for clopidogrel resistance in patients with CHD.
