[Results of implementation of a 'Complex of measures to improve medical care for patients with stroke in the Russian Federation'].
Vascular diseases of the brain and heart are the main cause of death and disability of the population of the Russian Federation.  The social and economic burden of acute cerebral circulation disorders necessitated the development of a national program for the care of patients with acute vascular diseases.
As a result of the implementation of a set of measures to improve medical care for patients with stroke over the past decade, the regions of the Russian Federation managed to create an 'insult network', equip the departments with high-tech diagnostic and therapeutic equipment, and train medical personnel.
Due to the implementation of modern methods of treatment of stroke, the rates of disability and mortality from stroke have decreased.
