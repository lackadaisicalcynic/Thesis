AIM  The study aimed at showing actual information about vestibular migraine and presenting different features of vestibular migraine for prevention of diagnostic mistakes and choosing an effective treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty patients with vestibular migraine were diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition and examined in a neurological department.  RESULTS
Problems with outpatient diagnosis and treatment were found.  Many patients were not diagnosed correctly and, therefore, did not receive effective management of vestibular migraine.
All clinical features, information of disease history and different objective signs were important for differential diagnosis with other types of dizziness.
Management according to guidelines for migraine treatment and recent research of vestibular migraine showed its efficiency for patients.
CONCLUSION
Spreading of actual information about vestibular migraine is important due to its underdiagnosis.
Knowledge of clinical features is helpful for diagnosis and differential diagnosis.
Treatment approaches according to guidelines and last research should be used.
