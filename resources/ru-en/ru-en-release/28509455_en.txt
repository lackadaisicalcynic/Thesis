[Transport function of the lymph nodes in young and old animals].  The paper discusses the age-related changes of contractile activity of the capsule of the lymph nodes, underlying their transport function.
The results of the studies conducted on the mesenteric lymph nodes of young and old bulls are presented.
The changes in the contractile function of the capsule of the lymph nodes were revealed in the older animals.  The changes appeared in the decrease of the amplitude and increase of the phase contraction frequency which are based on the replacement of smooth muscle by connective tissue, the enhancement of pacemaker activity of smooth muscle cells and endothelial dysfunction of lymph node cells.
