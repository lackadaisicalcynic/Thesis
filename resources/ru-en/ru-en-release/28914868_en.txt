[Combination treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations using endovascular and microsurgical techniques].
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 40 patients with cerebral AVMs.
In the study group, 14 (35%) patients underwent microsurgical resection without preliminary embolization (1st group), and 26 (65%) patients underwent combined treatment (endovascular embolization and microsurgical intervention, 2nd group).
The first group included patients with S&M grade I-III AVMs, and the second group included patients with S&M grade II-V AVMs.
Treatment outcomes were evaluated with allowance for completeness of AVM resection, operative blood loss, duration of surgery, changes in clinical and neurological impairments according to the modified Rankin scale, and rate of neurological and surgical complications.
RESULTS
According to postoperative findings, AVMs were totally resected in all patients.
Persistent focal neurological symptoms developed in 2 (7.7%) cases in the second group; neurological complications occurred in 1 (7.1%) patient in the first group.
The mean blood loss during resection of AVMs without preliminary embolization and embolized AVMs in patients with S&M grade I-III AVMs was 271.4 mL and 149.1 mL, respectively.
The duration of surgery and blood loss did not differ significantly in microsurgery and combination treatment groups.
CONCLUSION
Combination treatment, including microsurgical intervention after endovascular embolization, is an effective treatment for AVMs, in particular for high grade (S&M grade III-V) AVMs.
Teamwork and coordination among the surgeon, endovascular surgeon, and radiologist in treatment of AVMs is a prerequisite for a good outcome.
