[The efficacy of cocarnit in diabetic neuropathy].
AIM  To study the efficacy of the complex therapy, including cocarnit (group B vitamins, triphosadenine and nicotinamide), of diabetic neuropathy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty-one patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and distal symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy were examined.  Patients were divided into 2 groups.
Patients of the main group (n=26) received complex therapy, including cocarnit, and patients of the comparison group (n=15) received standard treatment.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The positive dynamics based on the VAS (р=0.0001), TSS (р=0.0001), NSS (р=0.001), NDS (р=0.0431), SF-36 (р=0.0008), electroneuromyographic results and glycated hemoglobin levels was observed in the main group.
In patients of the comparison group, the positive dynamics was instable; the scores of clinical scales did not reach statistical significance.  The results suggest the use of cocarnit in the complex treatment of patients with diabetic neuropathy.
