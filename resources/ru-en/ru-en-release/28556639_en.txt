[Bioinformatic investigation of the involvement of candidate genes of cytokines in the formation of large myomatous nodes in women with uterine cancer in older age groups].  The aim was to study bioinformatics involvement of candidate genes of cytokines in the formation of large fibroids in women with uterine cancer in older age groups.
Genotyping of 15 molecular genetic markers cytokines was performed in 120 patients with uterine myoma with large myoma nodes and 107 patients with myoma nodes of small size.
The study found that genetic risk factors for fibroids with large uterine fibroids are two combinations of genetic variants: G SDF-1, CC IL-1β, A RANTES (OR=5,56) and A RANTES with genotype CC IL-1β (OR=4,60).  12 of 15 polymorphic loci studied in various combinations (8 revealed significant combinations) have protective value in the formation of large fibroids with uterine cancer (OR=0,09-0,31).
