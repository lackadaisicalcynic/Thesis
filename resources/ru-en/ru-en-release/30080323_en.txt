[Element status of elder Petrozavodsk citizens.]  The purpose of this research was to estimate the element status of elder Petrozavodsk citizens and to compare them with the same characteristic of people living in the central part of Russia.
The hair samples taken from people aged 60 and more were examined to study the content of 25 macro- and micro elements using the method of atom-emission and mass spectrometry with inductively bonded argon plasma.
No misbalance was found in Al, As, Be, Ni and minor misbalance was found in Cd, Li, Sn, V. Toxic elements Hg and Pb and essential element B were found in hair samples in higher concentrations as compared to the referent values.  Low concentrations in comparison with the referent values were found in Ca, Zn, Mg, I, Fe, P, Cu, Mn, Cr, Se, Si.
The above-listed element status peculiarities can be associated both with old age and specific environmental, ecological and social aspects of living in the European North.
Elemental misbalance detected can lead to endemic microelemetoses and health deterioration in elder Petrozavodsk citizens.
