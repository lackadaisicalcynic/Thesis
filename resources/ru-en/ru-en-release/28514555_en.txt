[The use of the gender dimorphism index of J. Tanner for assessing the physical state of older women].  Assessment of the physical status of older women conducted anthropometry and bioimpendance analysis.
Body type determined by the gender dimorphism index of J. Tanner (1951).
It was found that in the studied sample representative of gynecomorphic and mesomorphic body types were determined in a high percentage of cases: 46,15 and 49,11 %. Women andromorphic body type were found less frequently - 4,74 %. Women with gynecomorphic body type were smaller mass and transverse dimensions of the body, unlike representatives with andromorphic and gynecomorphic body types.  The absolute content of fat and lean body mass tended to increase from gynecomorphic body types representatives to andromorphic.
The results of anthropometric measurements, bioimpedance analysis and determined by the gender dimorphism index of J. Tanner provide results about adaptive possibilities the human body and can serve as markers (predictors) of somatic diseases.
