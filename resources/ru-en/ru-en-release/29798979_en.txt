[The state of microcirculation and platelet hemostasis in patients with ischemic stroke after systemic thrombolytic therapy].  AIM
The state of microcirculation and platelet hemostasis in patients with ischemic stroke after systemic thrombolytic therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Forty-two patients after systemic thrombolytic therapy (TLT) (mean age 64.26 [60.58; 68.06]) and 47 patients without TLT (54.52 [47.48; 60.83]) were studied.
The study of platelet hemostasis was conducted with the determination of platelet aggregation (AT) on adrenaline, ADP, ristomycin, spontaneous aggregation on days 1, 7 and 14.
Studies of the state of microcirculation of cerebral vessels were carried out using the laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Characteristics of changes in induced AT and parameters of the microcirculation system in patients after systemic TLT at 1, 7 and 14 days in comparison with the indices of patients without TLT were revealed that allowed to expand the understanding of pathological mechanisms of the microcirculatory bed, their connection with violations of central hemodynamics and to obtain additional markers of disease course and prognosis.
