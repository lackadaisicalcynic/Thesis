[Papillomatosis as a criteria for the formation of the group at risk of laryngeal cancer].
The objective of the present study was to determine the incidence of dysplastic pre-neoplastic alterations in the patients presenting with papillomatosis.
The results of the clinical, endoscopic, and morphological examination of 42 patients presenting with laryngeal papillomas made it possible to diagnose grade II-III laryngeal cancer in 7 (16.7%) patients.
Half of them exhibited pre-neoplastic changes in laryngeal mucosa.  The following criteria for the formation of laryngeal cancer risk groups, besides grade II-III epithelial dysplasia, were identified: long (over 12 months) history of papillomatosis, human papilloma virus infection, the history of smoking over 20 years, professional contacts with petroleum, oil, and lubrication materials, and the male gender.
An algorithm of observation and treatment for each group of patients differing in the degree of dysplastic changes in laryngeal mucosa was proposed.
It is concluded that adequate clinical and endoscopic monitoring of the patients at risk of laryngeal cancer makes it possible to increase the frequency of detection of this condition at the early stages of its development.
