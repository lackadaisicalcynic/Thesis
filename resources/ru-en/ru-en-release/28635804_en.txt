[Some issues of the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease].  The clinical inefficacy of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is very frequently encountered in nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (NERD) in particular.
Postprandial acid pocket, weak-acid or alkaline reflux, etc. are one of the causes of resistance to antisecretory drugs.
Alginates serve as a good alternative to PPIs in treating NERD and gastroesophageal reflux in children and pregnant women.
The alginate test may help diagnose NERD.
