[The modern possibilities for the application of multispiral computed tomography in diagnostics of paranasal sinuses mycetomas].  The objective of the present study was the analysis of the health status of 20 patients presenting with histologically verified paranasal sinuses mycetomas (fungus balls) with special reference to CT-semiotics characteristic of the fungal ball as early as during the pre-verification period.
The surgical strategy for the management of this condition has been substantiated.
It is concluded that the final verification of the pathological process in question is possible only based on the results of the histological studies.
