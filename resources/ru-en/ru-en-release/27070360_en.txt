[The quality of nighttime sleep in patients with multiple sclerosis].
OBJECTIVE
to study the quality of nighttime sleep in multiple sclerosis (MS) using the PSQI.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The quality of nighttime sleep was compared in 48 patients with relapsing MS.
Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the PSQI scores.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Sleep disturbances were more frequent in patients with MS.  Women had higher risk of sleep disturbances.
In the group with a poor quality of nighttime sleep, complaints about the increase in latency and low quality of sleep and daily activities were more common.
The global severity of neurological deficit and disturbance of motor activity affected the quality of nighttime sleep.
