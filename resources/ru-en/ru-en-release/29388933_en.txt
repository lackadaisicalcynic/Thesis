[The application of the modern phototherapeutic technologies for the medical rehabilitation of the children].  This literature review is focused on the application of polychromatic and monochromatic polarized light for the treatment of various diseases of the childhood including those in the newborns and the premature babies.
The analysis of the data of scientific research gives evidence of the beneficial effect of polychromatic polarized light on the clinical course of various skin diseases in the newborn children.  Moreover, the improved immunological and reparative processes were revealed after the surgical interventions for congenital heart defects in the newborns.
The light-induced changes in the skin contribute to the realization of therapeutic effects of polarized polychromatic light in such children's diseases as atopic dermatitis, bronchitis, bronchial asthma, neurogenic urinary bladder dysfunction, and the traumatic injuries of the limbs.
The biologically positive physiological effects of monochromatic polarized light are known to contribute to the improvement of the clinical and functional status in the children presenting with bronchial asthma and in the patients frequently suffering from acute respiratory diseases.
The versatility of the biological effects of polarized light taken together with the possibility of its application from the first days of the child's life, the short duration of the procedure, the absence of unpleasant sensations and contact between the damaged surface and the device as well as the simplicity of using the equipment determine the promising prospects for the use of the proposed method in the clinical pediatric practice.
