[Multimorbidity of elderly persons in urban and rural areas of the Nizhny Novgorod region.]  The article compares the prevalence of pathological changes in different organs and systems among city and rural residents of the next ages: elderly (60-74 years for men and 55-74 years for women), senile (75-84 years) and advanced (85 years and older) ages.
The results of the continuous survey of all persons of the retirement age of one urban (7 809 people) and two rural areas (14 749) of the Nizhny Novgorod region were analyzed.  The region is comparatively homogeneous in terms of the national composition of the population.
In the city, the number of chronic pathologies of different organs and systems per one person of elderly age are: 2,83 for man and 2,76 for woman of elderly ages, 3,06 and 3,07 respectively for senile ages, 2,71 and 2,75 of advanced ages.
In rural areas, the analyzed indicators for men and women are respectively 1,64 and 1,58 for elderly ages, 1,84 and 1,78 for senile ages, 1,86 and 1,84 for advanced ages.
Demonstrating the difference in the phenotypic manifestations of the genes of predisposition to chronic diseases in old age between the city and village, the results make it possible to produce the following assumptions.
First, better access to medical care does not guarantee the better health status of the elderly, while it contributes to an increase in the life expectancy of men.
Second, in spite of better access to health care, urban lifestyle contributes to the accumulation of chronic diseases in population of a region.
Third, if chronic pathology of three different classes of diseases presented, then the probability of a long life is fundamentally determined by the access to health care.
Fourth, the probability of longevity is significantly reduced in result of illness by neoplasms, cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine or genitourinary diseases in ages of working or beginning of retirement period.
