[Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients: the possibilities of effective hemostasis].  AIM
To improve the results of treatment of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (GEVB) in cirrhotic patients with thrombocytopenia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total experience of the clinic includes 338 GEVB patients, endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) were performed in 162 and 157 cases respectively.  Nevertheless, just the efficacy of initial pharmacological hemostatic therapy was analyzed.
RESULTS
Administration of serotonin adipinate 30-50 mg/day during 3-5 days in addition to standard initial therapy allowed us to achieve permanent hemostasis during initial treatment if EVL was impossible.  Serotonin adipinate induces thrombocytes' adhesion and improves fibrin clot strength.
This therapy markedly decreases mortality (33.3% vs 46.7%), incidence of recurrent bleeding (46.4% vs 60.0%).  Also it contributes successful hemostasis with endoscopic ligation and effective portal decompression by TIPS procedure.
