[Clinical and psychological mechanisms involved in the formation of syndromes of delusional and overvalued constructions].
AIM
The identification of clinical-psychopathological and pathopsychological components involved in the formation of syndromes of delusional and overvalued constructions.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 93 subjects using experimental psychological techniques for detection of cognitive styles.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A specific combination of phenomenological disorders and cognitive style characteristics in different types of delusional (sensual, imaginative and interpretive) and delusion-like (overvalued) states has been singled out.  It has been shown that a specific combination of different cognitive-motivational controllers of intellectual process underlies the mechanisms of these disorders.
It is a basis for the formation of specific structures of pathological personal meanings with the dominance of imaginative or ideational patterns or deformations of the semantic significance of the stimuli.
