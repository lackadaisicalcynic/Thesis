[Current approaches to diagnosing and treating eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis: The 2015 international guidelines].  The 2015 international guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, formerly known as the Churg-Strauss syndrome, are detailed and an attempt is made to expand an evidence base, by attracting more recent available publications.
The new guidelines should not be regarded as final standards; these are primarily to extend the possibilities of choosing a personified management strategy for patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and to serve as the starting point for further in-depth investigations.
