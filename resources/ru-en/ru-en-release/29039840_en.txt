[Use of loop diuretics in heart failure: Current aspects].  Loop diuretics take the lead in the treatment of patients with symptomatic heart failure.
Torasemide is the most effective and safe loop diuretic with the optimal pharmacokinetic profile, the additional properties associated with simultaneous blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and with the antiadrenergic effects of the drug, its positive impact on myocardial fibrosis and minimal severe potential negative effects.
Sustained-release torasemide provides a more comfortable removal of excess liquid and does not deteriorate quality of life.
