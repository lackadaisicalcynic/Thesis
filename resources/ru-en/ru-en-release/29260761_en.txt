[Mineral composition of mixed saliva in patients with dental fluorosis].  The aim of the study was to assess the mineral composition of mixed saliva in dental fluorosis patients undergoing treatment with microabrasion and bleaching.
The study included 60 patients aged 18-35 years with various forms of dental fluorosis.  Group 1 included 40 patients in which enamel microabrasion was performed, group 2 - 20 patients with microabrasion and bleaching.
Mixed saliva composition was analyzed with Olimpus automatic analyzing device.
Dental fluorosis treatment in both groups resulted in saliva mineral composition changed associated with enamel demineralization which proves the necessity for calcium and phosphate containing compositions in these treatment groups.
