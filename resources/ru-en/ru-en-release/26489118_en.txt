[Fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography findings in central fundus of myopic patients].
UNLABELLED  Myopia prevalence grows alike in many countries, including Russia, regardless of geographical and population conditions.
AIM
to assess fundus changes in myopic patients at different ocular axial lengths by means of modern diagnostic tools.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study enrolled 97 patients (194 eyes) aged 45 Â± 20.17 years with myopia of different degrees.  Besides a standard ophthalmic examination, all patients underwent fundus fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography.
RESULTS
The occurrence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy (diffuse or focal) has been shown to increase with increasing ocular axial length.
Only 27 eyes (28.1%) appeared intact.  As myopia progression implies axial growth of the eye, it is associated with a more severe decrease in choroid, RPE, and photoreceptor layer thicknesses: the longer the anterior-posterior axis, the thinner the above mentioned fundus structures.
Age-related changes in the fundus are also likely to be more pronounced in longer axes.  Myopic traction maculopathy, which in our case appeared the main cause of increased retinal thickness, was diagnosed in 105 eyes, "outer" macular retinoschisis--in 40 eyes.
CONCLUSION
Thus, modern diagnostic tools, such as fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, enable objective assessment of the central fundus.
