[Childhood maltreatment and its impact on the mental health].
This review covers the literature of the last 25 years on the impact of childhood maltreatment on the mental health throughout the individual's life.  Child abuse increases the risk of many mental disorders including depression, suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior, anxiety-related disorders, psychoses as well as alcohol and other drug abuse.
The impact of child trauma on the mental health is largely due to structural and functional changes in the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex.  Early preventive interventions play a great role in the prevention of mental disorders associated with childhood adversities.
