Successful endovascular treatment of mycotic aneurysms of the inferior mesenteric artery and the abdominal aorta.  AIM
To report a case of successful endovascular treatment of mycotic aneurysms of the inferior mesenteric artery and the aorta.  CASE REPORT
Infrarenal aortitis in a 55-year-old multimorbid man resulted in formation of two mycotic aneurysms, one in the infrarenal aorta and the other in the inferior mesenteric artery.  The patient was treated with a bifurcated aortic endograft.
Antibiotic therapy was continued postoperatively for one year.  Shrinkage of both aneurysms was obtained with no signs of infection or endoleaks at five year follow-up.
CONCLUSION  Aortic endografting combined with long-term antibiotic treatment may be considered as a treatment option in similar cases.
