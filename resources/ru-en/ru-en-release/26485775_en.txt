[Histological and immunohistochemical examinations in the diagnosis of hepatic amyloidosis].  OBJECTIVE
to investigate the histopathology of amyloid in liver biopsy specimens.
MATERIAL AND METHODS.  A total of 46 liver biopsy specimens were investigated in patients with histologically verified amyloidosis in 2006 to 2009 from the Amyloid Registry of the Charité University Hospital (Berlin).
The liver biopsy specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin.
The paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and with Congo red.
Amyloid was immunohistochemically classified using antibodies against amyloid P component, AA amyloid, apolipoprotein Al, lysozyme, fibrinogen, transthyretin, and κ and λ light chains.
RESULTS
Amyloid deposits were diagnosed in the 46 liver biopsy specimens from 17 women and 29 men (mean age 60 years).
Immunohistochemical subtyping was successful in 91% of the cases.
AL amyloidosis was diagnosed in 87% of the biopsy specimens and further classified as AL lambda-light chain amyloidosis (57%) and AL kappa-light chain amyloidosis (30%).
The 46 liver biopsy specimens showed one case of AA amyloidosis (2%) and one case of transthyretin amyloidosis (2%).
The type of amyloid could not be classified in 9% of the biopsy specimens.
CONCLUSION
The investigation revealed that the most common types of hepatic amyloidosis are AL lambda- and AL kappa-light chain amyloidosis associated with the signs of parenchymal atrophy and steatosis.
