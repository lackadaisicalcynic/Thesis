[Forensic medical implications of the traumas and traces of biological deposits in the context of comprehensive expertises of the injuries inflicted inside the passenger compartment of the car].
The results of analysis of forensic medical expertises carried out by different state institutions of forensic medical expertise of this country are presented.  It was shown that the practice of standardized expertises of the injuries inflicted inside the passenger compartment of the car remains to be established.
The comprehensive approach to the solution of the problem of the circumstances of the road traffic accident and the positions of its participants in the passenger compartment of the car is possible based only on the multi-faceted investigation.
The definitive combined study including the analysis and comparison of the results of the autotechnical expertise, forensic medical examination of the corpses and the survivors inside the passenger car compartment, forensic biological (molecular genetic) expertises, and medico-criminalistic investigations of the traces of biological deposits and microparticles retained on the components of the passenger compartments and the clothes of the victims makes it possible to determine, with a high degree of accuracy, the position of the participants of the traffic accident inside the passenger compartment of the car at the moment of collision.
