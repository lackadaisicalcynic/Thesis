[The role of microbiota in chronic pharyngitis].  This article describes the modern approaches to the diagnostics and treatment of fungoid conditions of the pharynx with special reference to the main methods for the detection of pharyngomycosis and its clinical manifestations based on the results of analysis of the investigations carried out during the period from 2012 till 2016.
Among the 3,465 patients presenting with chronic inflammatory pathology of the pharynx who sought medical advice and treatment at the clinical departments of the Institute, 861 ones (25%) were found to have mycotic lesions of the pharynx.
Erythematous (atrophic) chronic pharyngitis was the predominant form of the disease documented in 2,059 patients whereas the remaining 1, 406 ones presented with the hypertrophic forms.
The fungal infection was diagnosed in 403 (19,5%) patients with erythematous atrophic chronic pharyngitis in comparison with 458 (32,5%) patients suffering from the hypertrophic forms of this pathology including pseudomembranous, hyperplastic (granulomatous), and erosive-ulcerative ones.
The principal pathogenic agents responsible for the development of fungal pharyngitis in our patients were fungi of the genus Candida that accounted for 97 - 99% of all the cases of this disease.
The currently available modalities for the treatment of pharyngomycosis are described.
