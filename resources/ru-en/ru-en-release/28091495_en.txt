[Psychopathological characteristics and social functioning of the schizophrenic patients with the T allele of the MTHFR677C>T polymorphism].  AIM
To compare the severity of psychopathological symptoms and characteristics of personal and social functioning in patients with schizophrenia, carriers of different alleles of the MTHFR677C>T polymorphism.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and fifty patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were genotyped for the MTHFR677C>T polymorphism, some of them were examined using psychometric scales and tests (PANSS, SANS, PSP, CDSS, a battery of cognitive tests etc).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Patients with the MTHFR677T variant had greater severity of negative symptoms regardless of psychometric instruments used in the study, greater severity of schizophrenia disorder in whole measured with the PANSS General psychopathological symptoms subscale, higher scores on the PANSS cognitive cluster and lower levels of personal and social functioning measured with the PSP compared to the patients with the MTHFR677CС genotype.
The results of psychometric testing are in line with significant differences of MTHFR677T allele carriers from those with the MTHFR677CС genotype in the number of disable patients and the use of different types of psychiatric services.
The differences were not related to sex, age, illness duration and depressive symptoms measured with CDSS and PANSS «depression/anxiety» factor.
