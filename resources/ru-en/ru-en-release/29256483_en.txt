[The possibilities for the expert diagnostics of the influence of the glance of a bullet on the character of the injuries inflicted by shooting a hunting weapon].
The objective of the present work was to study and analyze the available data concerning the influence of the glance of a bullet on the character of the injuries inflicted by shooting certain types of hunting weapons.
This review gives evidence of the possibility of the objective diagnostics of the injuries inflicted by gunshots using the rifle-bore weapons.  However, we have failed to find information about the diagnostic criteria for the evaluation of the wounds inflicted by the bullets shot from smooth-bore hunting rifles after their glance from various surfaces in the available special literature publications.
Such situation creates the prerequisites for the erroneous conclusions from the results of forensic medical expertise of the after-penetration blunt wounds.
