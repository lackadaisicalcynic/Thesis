[The need of children of the Crimean regions with different medical and social conditions in orthodontic treatment].  The aim of the study was to investigate the needs of children of various Crimean regions in orthodontic care.
The epidemiological survey involved 125 children under the age of 12 years old living in the regions of Crimea with different levels of medical and social conditions (Alushta, Simferopol, Lenin and the Krasnogvardeisky district).  The two-component IOTN index was used in investigation.
Children of regional municipal areas showed higher severity of malocclusion and the need in orthodontic care than their urban peers (p<0.01 for Pearson Ï‡2 criterion).  A large part of the surveyed demonstrated a low motivation to receive orthodontic treatment according to aesthetic component of IOTN index.
It was determined a strong correlation between of dental status values of the IOTN index and the number of orthodontists in the region, as well as the average strength of connection between the objective component of the index and ecological potential of the territory.  It was revealed a moderate linkage between the indicators of the subjective component and the region of residence of the child.
Thus, it is necessary to develop and implement programs of prevention of dentofacial anomalies in children with regard for regional peculiarities.
