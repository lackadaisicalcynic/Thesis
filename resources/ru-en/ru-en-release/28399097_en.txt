[Influence chronopharmacology therapy methionine (melaxen) on the dynamics of sleep disturbance, cognitive and emotional disorders, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in patients with cerebral stroke in the early and late recovery periods].  AIM
To study the efficacy of melaxen on the dynamics of sleep disturbance, cognitive and emotional disorders, BDNF and the level of secretion of melatonin (6-SOMT) in patients with stroke in the early and late recovery phase.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  One hundred and ten patients in the rehabilitation period of stroke (mean age of 58.4Â±6.4 years), including 60 patients in the early recovery phase (group 1) and 50 patients in the late phase (group 2), were studied.
Patients received melaxen in dose of 3 mg/day for 3 months along with standard treatment.
The efficacy of therapy was assessed by the dynamics of sleep disorders, emotional status, dynamics of serum BDNF levels, 6-SOMT concentration in the urine.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The study has demonstrated the high efficacy of melaxen in the rehabilitation of patients in early and late recovery phase of stroke.
The drug significantly increased the BDNF level that correlated with improved sleep, emotional status, quality of life of patients.
