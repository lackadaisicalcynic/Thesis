[Gut microbiota and obesity: Pathogenetic relationships and ways to normalize the intestinal microflora].  The review demonstrates mechanisms in the relationship of obesity to gut microbiota, as well as possible therapeutic measures to normalize the intestinal microflora.
There is evidence that the latter makes a great contribution to the pathogenesis of obesity and related diseases.
Investigations have shown the role of the nature of consumed foods (fatty foods) in reducing the amount of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, as well as the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharides and metabolites from the intestinal microflora (trimethylamine-N-oxide, bile acids, etc.).
The use of prebiotics, probiotics and ursodeoxycholic acid preparations and fecal transplantation are promising in correcting the microflora and in providing their positive effect on metabolic disturbances.
Certain probiotic strains are effective in treating dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.
Gut microbiota is impaired in obesity and contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases.  The control of the gut microbiota and the use of drugs altering the composition of the microflora may become a novel approach to reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
