[The assessment of the efficacy of citicoline in the early and recovery stages of stroke].
The review presents data on the evaluation of the efficacy of citicoline in ischemic stroke.
It presents research findings about the effect of citicoline to reduce infarct volume in animal models of cerebral ischemia.  Long-term treatment of CDP-choline initiated 24 hours after stroke contributes to the increased plasticity of neurons in intact brain areas (functionally associated with the damaged areas) and accelerated functional recovery.
The oral administration of citicoline within the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms in moderate and severe stroke increases the probability of complete recovery in 3 months.
A neuroprotective effect of citicoline in acute and early restorative stages of stroke accompanied by cognitive impairment was shown.
According to the results of clinical trials of the dosage regimen, citicoline administered in the dose of 1000 mg/day for 8 weeks accelerates the regression of hemiplegia; the intravenous injection in the dose of 750 mg/day for 10 days, starting with the first 48 hours of stroke onset symptoms, promotes the recovery of motor and cognitive functions; the intravenous injection in the dose of 1 g within 14 days improves the recovery of consciousness, general condition and functional status.
