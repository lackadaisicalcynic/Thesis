Antibiotic use in poultry: a survey of eight farms in Thailand.
Objective  To investigate antibiotic use in poultry farms in Thailand and estimate the total amount of antibiotics used annually in Thai production of chicken meat.
Methods
In a single province, we surveyed eight farms in which chickens were raised for meat and interviewed the farms' owners in 2016.
The antibiotic use for each chicken was defined as the amount of antibiotic given to the chicken over its entire lifetime divided by the target weight of the chicken at the time of its slaughter.  Assuming that the results were nationally representative, we estimated annual antibiotic use on all Thai chickens raised for meat.
Findings
No use of antibiotics for growth promotion was reported.
Five farms raised 1-kg chickens for company A and reportedly used no antibiotics unless the chickens were sick.  The other three farms raised 3-kg chickens for company B and reported routine use of antibiotics for prophylaxis.
Per kg final weight, each chicken raised for company B was reportedly routinely given a mean of 101 mg of antibiotics - that is, 33 mg of amoxicillin, 29 mg colistin, 19 mg oxytetracycline, 18 mg doxycycline and 2 mg tilmicosin.
The total amount of antibiotic used on all Thai chickens raised for meat in 2016 was estimated to be 161 tonnes.
Conclusion
Each year in Thailand, many tonnes of antibiotics are probably routinely used in raising chickens for meat.
Labels on retail packs of meat should include data on antibiotic use in the production of the meat.
