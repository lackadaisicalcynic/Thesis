[Cortexin.  Molecular mechanisms and targets of neuroprotective activity].
Neurotrophic drug cortexin, a lyophilized extraction of animal cortex, comprises neuropeptides, amino acids and trace elements.  The nucleoprotein complexes of the cerebral cortex can also retain elements of chromatin with DNA fragments.
All of these components of cortexin have a specific range of "targets" for the specific correction of the molecular and cellular processes at various stages of the pathological process.  A modern concept of neurosignaling considers the associated processes - from the synaptic level to the epigenetic patterns of neuron nucleus, in which an important place belongs to corrective peptide molecules.
Peptide components of cortexin derived from the animal brain, which interact with cellular and molecular "targets", provide a new view on mechanisms of neuroprotection.
