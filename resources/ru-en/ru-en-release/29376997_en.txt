[Primary headache - risk factor or comorbid pathology in cognitive impairment].  Currently, the relationship between headache and dementia is considered more widely than just a comorbidity.
The severity of migraine and tension-type headache and the severity of cognitive impairment are strongly correlated.
Common pathophysiological mechanisms underlie the relationship between primary headache and cognitive impairment.
Antinociceptive changes in primary headaches and in glutamate excitotoxicity in dementia developed due to hyper excitability of NMDA receptors are strongly interdependent.
It is important in the aspect of possible correction of this pathology by NMDA-antagonists.  Memantine not only slows the progression of cognitive symptoms in dementia, but also significantly influences the frequency and severity of primary headache.
