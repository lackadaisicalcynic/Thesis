[Endothelial dysfunction and arterial wall stiffness: New targets in diabetic nephropathy].
In recent years, one of the promising areas in clinical medicine is the study of impaired ments in endothelial function and arterial wall stiffness, which can be referred to as one of the important predictors of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease, including that of diabetic etiology.  There is strong evidence that endothelial function and great artery stiffness may be used as reliable clinical and instrumental indicators to evaluate the efficiency of therapeutic measures and the rate of progression of cardiovascular disorders in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The article presents data on the role of endothelial dysfunction and arterial wall stiffness in the progression of chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and discusses the possibility of their correction with pharmacological agents.
