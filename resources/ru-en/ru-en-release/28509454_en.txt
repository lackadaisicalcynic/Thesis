[Monoamine oxidase activity in rat pineal gland: comparison with brain areas, alteration during aging].
Using benzylamine as a substrate, the amine oxidase activity was determined in the pineal gland of adult rats and compared with the same activity in brain areas and pituitary.
Two groups of rats aged 6-8 and 14-15 months were also compared on the basis of this activity.
Benzylamine deaminating activity in the pineal gland was significantly higher than in the area preoptica medialis, the corpus mamillare, the tuberculum olfactorium, and the hypophysis, and lower than in the eminentia mediana.
The significant increase of the activity in the pineal gland in animals of age from 6-8 to 14-15-months was revealed.
Benzylamine deaminating activity in the pineal gland was totally inhibited by 0,002 mM R deprenyl, indicating the B type monoamine oxidase (MAO B) activity.
Age-associated increase of MAO B activity in the pineal gland accompanied by decrease of glutathione peroxidase activity, reported earlier, can promote the oxidative damage in the pineal gland during aging.
