[Active thermolocation probing as a promising rapid diagnostic test of carotid atherosclerosis].
AIM  To study the possibility of active thermolocation probing for the diagnosis of stenotic lesions of carotid arteries (CA).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighteenpatients without symptoms of cardiovascular diseases were examined using ultrasound.  The patients had isoechogenic stable atherosclerotic plaques (AP).
Ultrasound markers of AP instability were found in other patients.
All patients underwent telethermography of face, neck and extremities, ultrasound duplex scanning of CA.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
It has been demonstrated that complex thermography is sensitive to carotid atherosclerosis with ultrasound signs of unstable AP in CA.  Further studies will allow to determine the specificity and sensitivity of these diagnostic methods.
