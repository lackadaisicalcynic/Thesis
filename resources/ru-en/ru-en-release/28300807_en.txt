[The forecast of illicit drug use in adolescents with addictive behavior: personality traits and the level of genetic risk of substance dependence.]
AIM
To clarify the psychological mechanism underlying the genetic risk of substance addiction at the first stage of drug use by adolescents.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Genetic risk was evaluated by genotyping of 5 polymorphisms of the dopaminergic system genes (dopamine receptor D2 and D4 genes and tyrosine hydroxylase gene).
Psychological testing was performed using the Russian version of Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-125).  Seventy-five adolescents, aged 14-17 years, (girls 32%), who misused alcohol, including 22 adolescents using drugs, were examined.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The level of genetic risk was directly correlated with the probability of drug use by boys, for girls the correlation was not confirmed.
The increase of the level of genetic risk for boys was correlated with the increase on the scale «Self-directedness» of TCI-125 that may reflect a probable tendency to replacement of negative information, feeling of illusory wellbeing.
The findings clarify the direction of measures for the prevention of drug use.
