[The pathomorphosis of schizophrenia].  The author considers the problem of pathomorphosis, i.e. the changes in clinical presentation of endogenous mental diseases (schizophrenia, depression), since the time of its classical description.
There is a general trend towards the development of forms with more favorable course in schizophrenia and the domination of prolonged and masked variants in depression.
These changes are discussed in aspects of true (natural) pathomorphosis and therapeutic (induced) pathomorphosis.
The relative character of this stratification and insufficient understanding of the problem in psychiatry in general are emphasized.
