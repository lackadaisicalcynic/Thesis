[Severity of anxiety and depressive disorders and their relationship with cerebral and hemodynamic impairment in patients with arterial hypertension in the practice of general practitioner].
AIM
To determine the relationship of anxiety and depressive disorders with cerebral and hemodynamic impairment in arterial hypertension (AH).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 97 patients with AH, stage II, who were followed up by a general practitioner.  The severity of anxiety and depression assessed with the HADS, severity of cerebral disorders and a set of hemodynamic parameters were evaluated.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
It was found that psycho-emotional disorders were combined with an increase in the frequency of modifying risk factors (smoking, high salt intake, overweight and obesity), severe cerebral disorders and significant changes in the elastic-tonic properties of a vascular wall.
Significant correlations between depression and vascular age were found.
