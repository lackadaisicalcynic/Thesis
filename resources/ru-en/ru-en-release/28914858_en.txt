[Bosentan use in pulmonary arterial hypertension: Russian and foreign experience].  The results of evaluating the efficacy and safety of bosentan in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as shown by the data of foreign randomized controlled trials and the authors' own experience, convincingly demonstrate that the introduction of the drug into clinical practice has led to a significant improvement of the possibilities of drug therapy in patients with this serious illness.
Bosentan substantially improves physical activity in patients, reduces the severity of clinical symptoms, slows down the rates of disease progression, and prolongs survival in patients with different forms of PAH.
