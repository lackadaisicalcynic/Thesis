PURPOSE  To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of peripheral lamellar keratoplasty (LKP) for treating relapsing pterygium.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study was conducted in the period of 2007-2017 and included 84 patients (91 eyes) with stage II-IV relapsing pterygium.
Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) before the surgery was in average 0.65±0.28 (0.01 to 1.0).
Astigmatism varied from 0.5 to 6.5 D (mean 3.41±2.06).
All patients underwent pterygium removal surgery followed by LKP.
The analyzed parameters included visual acuity, refraction error before and after the surgery, frequency of relapses and post-operative complications.
RESULTS
The follow-up period was 4 months to 10 years (mean 30.9±25.4 months).
BCVA after the surgery was 0.1-1.2 (mean 0.83±0.24), post-operative astigmatism - 0 to 3.5 D (1.08±0.62).
BCVA has improved and remained stable in 86 (94.5%) out of 91 eyes, decrease of visual acuity was observed in 5 cases (5.5%).
Frequent relapse of pterygium happened in 5 cases (5.5%), was non-progressing and required no surgical treatment.
CONCLUSION
LKP is an effective and safe method of surgical treatment of relapsing pterygium that provides good optical, tectonic and anti-relapsing results thanks to barrier properties of the layered transplant.
