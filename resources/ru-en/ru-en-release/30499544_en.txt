[Laser treatment of giant iris cyst in the anterior chamber in a child (a clinical observation)].  The article describes a clinical case of a giant post-traumatic iris cyst occupying the anterior chamber in a 3-year-old child successfully treated with laser methods (YAG-laser and diode-pumped laser with doubled frequency).
Cyst scarring was achieved with preservation of visual acuity of 1.0.
The follow-up period lasted 10 years.
The question of indications for laser methods of eliminating cysts of the anterior segment of the eye in children remains debatable.
The huge size is traditionally considered a contraindication for laser treatment of the cyst; it leads to death of the organ more often, especially after radical surgical removal of the cyst.
The described case confirms the feasibility of non-invasive laser treatment efforts even if the cyst is huge in size.
