[Clinical syndromes of neurotransmitter system dysfunction in severe brain injury].
AIM  To explore neurotransmitter system dysfunctions involved in maintaining of consciousness and motor functions in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and to assess their severity and predictive value.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors examined 100 patients (34 women and 66 men), aged 32.0 ± 13.0 years, with severe TBI.
Eighty-eight patients (31 women and 57 men) were studied in the acute stage (1-15 days, mean 5.8 ± 3.7 days) and 70 patients (24 women and 46 men) in the subacute stage (18-70 days, mean 30.4 ± 12.7 days).
Inclusion criteria were: severe TBI with depression of consciousness (≤ 7 scores on the Glasgow Coma Scale), admission to the hospital in acute and subacute stages.
Outcome of TBI was evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The following clinical syndromes of neurotransmitter system dysfunction were singled out: excess or insufficiency of glutamate, cholinergic deficit, excess or insufficiency of dopamine.
Their transformation during disease was identified.
Predictive value of neurotransmitter dysfunctions for TBI is emphasized.
