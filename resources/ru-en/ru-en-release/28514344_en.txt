[Erbium laser application for oral surgery in patients with platelet hemostatic disorders].
Hemostatic disorders are typically associated with prolonged bleeding after or during surgical procedures.
The aim of the study was to increase the efficiency of oral surgery in these patients using erbium laser.  Selected 46 patients receiving oral surgery were randomly divided in 2 groups: 43 patients with thrombocytopenia, trombocytemia and other platelet disorders treated with erbium laser and a control group of 43 patients without concomitant pathology determined for conventional surgical treatment.
No postoperative bleeding was seen in group 1.
Conventional procedures were associated with significantly more postoperative pain and epithelization took 1-3 days longer.
Erbium laser radiation is an up-to-date method which can be successfully used for oral surgery in patients with hemostatic disorders.
