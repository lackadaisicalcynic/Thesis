[The cross-plastic correction of the soft tissue defect on the neck with the use of a pectoral flap harvested from the opposite side].  The authors describe a patient presenting with initially multiple metachronous cancer spreading over the right-handed side of the mouth floor and the right-handed part of the lower jaw.  The patient who underwent cross-plastic surgery for the correction of the extensive soft tissue defect on the neck with the use of the musculocutaneous pectoral flap with the axial blood supply is described.
The observation during the 14 year follow-up period confirmed the good functional outcome of the treatment.
