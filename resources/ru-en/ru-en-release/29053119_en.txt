[Peptidergic nootropic therapy in cerebral palsy associated with epilepsy].
AIM  To assess the efficacy and safety of сortexin in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy (CP) combined with epilepsy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty-four patients (55 boys and 29 girls), aged from 1 to 11 years, with CP combined with epilepsy received cortexin together with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
Cortexin was administered in doses of 5-10 mg depending on the patient's age and body weight intramuscularly during hospitalization.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Cortexin as add-on to AEDs reduced for more than two times the number of seizures, along with improvement of motor function, in 31 (36.9%) patients.
The improvement of motor function, but without a significant decrease in epileptic seizures, was achieved in 15 (17.8%) of the patients.
Reduction of epileptic seizures frequency (>2 times), but without a significant effect on motor function, was observed in 14 cases (16.7%).
Twenty-three patients (27.4%) did not respond the therapy.
The aggravation of epileptic seizures during cortexin therapy was observed in only 1 girl with West syndrome (1.2%), and this was significantly lower than the probability of seizures aggravation on AED.
Polypeptide nootropic medication cortexin demonstrated efficacy and safety as adjunctive therapy in children with CP combined with epilepsy.
