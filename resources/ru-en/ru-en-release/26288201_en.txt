[The clinical manifestations and neurophysiological features of long-lasting paroxysmal vertigo:theanalysis of the original observations].
The objective of the present study was to elucidate specific features of etiology and pathophysiology of recurring chronic vestibular dysfunction.
It included 90 patients with this pathology of whom 24 (26.6%) presented with vascular compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve diagnosed by means of high-field MRI.
This method revealed the high frequency of positionally-dependent vestibular dysfunction associated with neurovascular interactions.
Analysis of the state of vestibular dysfunction during the attack-free periods demonstrated the signs of latent vestibular dysfunction in 20 (83.3%) patients.
The results of the study provide additional information on the prevalence of vascular compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve in the patients presenting with recurrent chronic dizziness; moreover, they make it possible to evaluate the state of vestibular function and develop the new diagnostic criteria for vestibular paroxismia.
