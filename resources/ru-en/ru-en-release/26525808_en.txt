[Clinical and psychopathological aspects of deficit disorders in the structure of initial stages of youth-onset endogenous psychosis].
OBJECTIVE
To study the structure of deficit disorders identified in the initial phase (first 5 years) of youth-onset endogenous psychosis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Author examined 232 patients with the first episode of juvenile endogenous psychosis during the period from 2005 to 2015 using integrated phenomenological and clinical/psychopathological approaches.  The follow-up was administered to 151 patients.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The working hypothesis on the formation of deficit symptom variants based on the mutual competition of its components was formulated.  Identified typological species allowed to hypothesize the existence of continual series of variations of deficit disorders manifested as phenomena with multilateral dependencies, characterized by dynamism and a wide range of modifications and verifiable in remission at the initial stages of attack-like endogenous psychosis.
