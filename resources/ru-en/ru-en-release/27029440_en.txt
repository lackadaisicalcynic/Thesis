[A monogenic model of schizophrenia: a shift in paradigms].  Advanced genome technologies, including genome-wide association studies, next generation sequencing analysis, whole exome sequencing, encourage the development of theoretical insights on the role of genetic factors in schizophrenia.
In this context, the author considers a monogenic model of schizophrenia and its evolution.
