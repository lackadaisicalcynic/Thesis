Monitoring the sustainable development goals through human rights accountability reviews.  The Universal Periodic Review is a comprehensive, state-to-state peer-review mechanism of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council.
Created in 2006, the mechanism scrutinizes the human rights record of all UN Member States, including their efforts to realize the right to health.
However, the mechanism is relatively under-used in global health governance compared to treaty-based procedures, such as those overseen by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities or the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.
We suggest that the Universal Periodic Review could be used to support the monitoring and review processes of the sustainable development goals (SDGs).  The review could offer a unique perspective for other actors on how to ensure accountability for the complex and intertwined SDGs, including their commitments for health.
This article provides an overview of how health-related rights have been addressed in the Universal Periodic Review process and how the review can contribute to advancing global commitments to health, including those embodied in the SDGs.  We present some of the current limitations in the way health is addressed in the Universal Periodic Review.
We also consider what role specialized UN agencies, such as the World Health Organization, might play during the Universal Periodic Review process and how this involvement can contribute towards the comprehensive realization of health and wellbeing for all.
