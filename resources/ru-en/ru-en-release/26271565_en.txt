[Infectious arthritis of sternoclavicular joint: surgical approach to the issue].
AIM
To study the features of occurrence, diagnosis, clinical course of infectious arthritis of sternoclavicular joint, as well as to develop differentiated therapeutic tactics depending on the clinical form and stage of disease.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was analyzed treatment of 18 patients with infectious arthritis of sternoclavicular joint aged 27 to 88 years who were hospitalized for the period 2008-2014.
Acute or chronic forms were determined depending on clinical course and serous arthritis, para-articular phlegmon and osteoarthritis--according to nature of tissue damage.  Hypothermia and blunt trauma were often preceded to onset of disease.
Diabetes and drug addiction were present as comorbidities.
Also disease as the variant of purulent metastasis in case of sepsis was noted.  Bone scintigraphy, CT and magnetic resonance imaging are the most informative.
RESULTS  Infectious arthritis of sternoclavicular joint often had hematogenous origin, and Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause.
At the stage of serous arthritis antibacterial therapy was effective.  Incision and drainage were performed urgently in case of para-articular phlegmon.
Sternoclavicular joint resection was performed usually in 2-3 months after subsidence of inflammation.
