[Music therapy procedures controlled by the brain potentials in treatment of functional disorders].
Twenty years ago, the Korsakov's Journal of Neurology and Psychiatry has published the article of Ya.I. Levin 'Brain music in the treatment of patients with insomnia'.  This publication was the starting point for an innovative approach to preventing and correcting functional disorders of a person via musical or music-like stimuli that are controlled by the brain potentials of patient's.
This approach called 'Music of the brain' is fully consistent with modern ideas about preventive neuroscience as a new field of scientific research at the intersection of neuroscience and preventive medicine.  In this review, the authors analyze initial studies on the effects of music on the brain and discuss their limitations.
To increase the effectiveness of the approach, a unique combination of musical therapy with the neurofeedback method, the technology of musical neurofeedback, has been developed.  Results of the application of developed technology for treatment of human functional disorders are presented, and promising directions for further research are outlined.
