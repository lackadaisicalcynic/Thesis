[Molecular and pathomorphological prognostic markers for melanoma: Current approaches and prospects].  The incidence of melanoma demonstrates a persistent increasing tendency, which justifies the need to study and identify new prognostic markers for the development and course of this disease.
The given paper shows current approaches to melanoma staging, including those to applying pathomorphological prognostic criteria, and discusses prospects for using the results of genomic and epigenomic studies of the carcinoma in clinical practice.
