AIM  To analyze clinical-diagnostic and surgical aspects of cardiac valve solid lesions as well as long-term results of surgical treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Clinical, diagnostic and surgical aspects of treatment of 51 patients with tumorous and pseudotumorous lesions of cardiac valves were analyzed.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Hospital complications were observed in 17.7% of patients.
Mortality rate was 3.9%.
1- and 28-year overall survival was 100% and 94.1% respectively.
Quality of life was good, satisfactory and unsatisfactory in 73.5%, 20.4% and 6.1% of cases respectively.  CONCLUSION
Timely diagnostics of tumorous and pseudotumorous lesions of cardiac valves is very difficult but possible based on short history, positional dependence of symptoms, embolic events without rhythm disturbances.  Additional instrumental methods including TTE, TEE, CT and MRI are necessary to define diagnosis.
Intraoperative diagnostics and immediate histological survey are useful to determine volume of surgery in each case.  Successful surgical treatment implies urgency, hypothermic perfusion and pharmaco-cold cardioplegia during operation.
