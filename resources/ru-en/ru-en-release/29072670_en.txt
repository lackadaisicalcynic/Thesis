[The genetic aspects of occupational hearing impairment].  This article was designed to be the overview of the current literature publications concerning the identification of the genetic markers of susceptibility to the noise-induced loss of hearing.
The analysis of these data has demonstrated that the major gene polymorphisms associated with the development of this pathological condition are localized in the genes encoding for the antioxidant systems, potassium homeostasis, and adhesion molecules as well as in the genes involved in intercellular coupling, the mechanisms underlying the cellular response to stress, activation and regulation of heat shock proteins, and signaling function of the immune system.
It is concluded that the further investigations into the genetic aspects of the full-genome sequencing techniques and the search for genomic associations could greatly contribute to the development of personalized medicine and the reduction of risks of occupational noise-induced sensorineural impairment of hearing.
