[Morphology of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation in neoplasias of oral mucosa].
The aim of the study was to assess correlation of E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression with proliferative activity and neoplasia grade in oral mucosa.
Oral biopsies of 48 patients were studied with focal hyperplasia, squamous intraepithelial neoplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma.  Tissue antigens were determined using a mouse monoclonal antibody to Ki-67 and E-cadherin and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to N-cadherin.
The study revealed correlation between the proliferative activity of epithelial cells and N-cadherin synthesis associated with decline of E-cadherin expression.  Intercellular junction proteins E- and N-cadherins may be used for early diagnosis of malignant transformation of oral squamous epithelium.
