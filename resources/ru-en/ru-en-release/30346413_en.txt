[Oral diseases structure in patients with diffuse liver lesions before and after transplantation].  Purpose of the study was to identify dental risk factors for complications at the stage of rehabilitation adaptation in patients with diffuse liver lesions.
The study included 52 patients with diffuse liver lesions aged 25-55 years, who were divided between two groups of 26 persons with different dental status, depending on the main disease stage of treatment.
RESEARCH METHODS
Clinical, x-ray, morphological, analytical, statistical.  RESULTS
It has been reliably established that low level of oral hygiene, high intensity and prevalence of caries and its complications (foci of odontogenic infection), inflammatory periodontal diseases joined with severe teeth hyperesthesia, dominate in patients before liver transplantation, which confirms low level of sanitation on stages of preparation for surgical treatment.  Chronic odontogenic infection in periodontal tissues with phenomena of epithelial cells dystrophy, candidiasis of the oral mucosa, foci of odontogenic infection, low level of oral hygine, tendency to precancerous diseases development are the risk factors for complications arise on the stage of rehabilitation adaptation in patients with diffuse liver lesions.
CONCLUSION
The revealed relationship between diffuse liver lesions and dental status of patients, at the stages of preparation and after liver transplantation indicates, that a low level of oral cavity sanitation, the presence of odontogenic infection and periodontal disease worsen the course of the main disease, increase the risk of transplant rejection and require the creation of a dental rehabilitation system for this category of patients.
