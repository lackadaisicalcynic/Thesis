[Twin pregnancy with complete hydatidiform mole].  The paper describes a case of twin pregnancy with complete hydatidiform mole (CHM).
According to the data available in the literature, the concurrence of CHM with a normal placenta and a viable fetus occurs in 1 per 20,000-100,000 pregnancies, requires a differential diagnosis with partial hydatidiform mole and placental mesenchymal dysplasia, and is characterized by a high rate of complications.
In this concurrence, the frequency of persistent trophoblastic disease is as high as 50%.
In this case, the pregnancy ended in a spontaneous abortion at 16-17 weeks of pregnancy.
A morphological examination determined the fetus without congenital malformations with normal placental weight and structure and the adjacent intact placental tissue with the macro- and microscopic signs of CHM.
The diagnosis was confirmed by the lack of Ñ€57 expression in the villous trophoblast and stroma in the tissue of the hydatidiform mole.
The patient was diagnosed with persistent trophoblastic disease at 2 months after the abortion.
