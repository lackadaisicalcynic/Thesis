[The use of neipilept in treatment of asthenic syndrome].
AIM  To assess the efficacy of neipilept in treatment of asthenic syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Two groups of patients, aged from 30 to 40 years, with functional asthenia were examined.
Patients were divided into main (n=40) and control (n=15) groups.
In 22% men and 56% women, the disease was precipitated by emotional stress, in 46 and 38% by physical and stressful work conditions.  Both groups received standard treatment.
Patients of the main group received additionally neipilept in solution (500 mg daily) during 30 days.
General physical and neurological examinations and psychometric assessment were performed.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A significant reduction of asthenic symptoms, an increase in self-rated physical and mental functioning, a decrease in symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, anxiety and depression were observed in the main group compared to the control one.
The positive changes in neuropsychological status improved quality of life and psychological adaptation in patients with functional asthenia exposed to chronic stress, physical and psychoemotional overstrain.
