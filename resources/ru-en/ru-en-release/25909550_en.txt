[Spleen-preserving D2-lymphodissection in gastric cancer surgery].  Oncological advisability of spleen removal during surgical treatment of gastric cancer is arguable at present time.
It is presented technique of spleen-preserving D2-lymphodissection used for gastric body and proximal part cancer which was applied in 155 patients.
Control group included 197 patients who underwent gastrectomy with splenectomy.
Spleen-preserving D2-lymphodissection increased duration of surgery but decreased frequency of subdiaphragmatic abscess and pancreatic fistulas and duration of hospital stay.
5-years survival (Kaplan-Meier) was 59% in main group, in control group - 55% (p>0.05).  We consider that spleen-preserving D2-lymphodissection is radical and safe surgical method for locally advanced cancer of gastric body and proximal part.
