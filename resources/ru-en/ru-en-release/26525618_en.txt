[Current possibilities of treatment of generalized convulsive seizures].
Current possibilities of treatment of generalized convulsive seizures are presented.
Progress in the field of pharmacotherapy of epilepsy allowed to introduce new antiepileptic drugs (AED).  Some of them are modified AED with higher efficacy or better tolerability and others represent a generation of new drugs with different mechanisms of action.
Perampanel, an agonist of AMPA-receptors, is a new drug approved in more than 40 countries, including Russia.  At present, the use of some AED is limited by the high risk of sudden death (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)).
SUDEP is a common cause of death directly associated with epilepsy, with the highest frequency in patients with active epilepsy.  Subtherapeutic concentrations of SED in the serum of SUDEP patients may be the consequence of inadequate treatment and low compliance to treatment that causes the development of pseudoresistant seizures and, hence, the higher risk of SUDEP.
At the same time, AED per se play an important role in the modification of functions of the autonomic nervous system and may induce disturbances of heart rate and conductivity.
