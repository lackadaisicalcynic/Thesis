AIM  To analyze the immediate and remote results of transanal endoscopic microsurgical intervantions and its role in treatment of rectal tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The results of transanal endoscopic microsurgery in 56 patients with rectal tumors were studied.
Adenoma and adenocarcinoma were observed in 45 (80%) and 11 (20%) patients respectively.
Mean height of tumor lower edge placement was 8.6 ± 0.3 cm from anus, mean diameter - 3.7 ± 0.3 cm.
All patients underwent full-layer resection of rectum.
RESULTS
Postoperative complications were observed in 4 (7%) patients.
There were no deaths.
Transanal endoscopic microsurgery is modern, adequate and effective treatment of benign and early forms of malignant rectal tumors.  It is associated with lower incidence of complications and recurrence under condition of careful selection of patients.
Based on obtained results we recommend surgeons to apply this technique only in case of tumor placement below 10-11 cm from anus and tumor's diameter up to 3-4 cm to minimize risk of complications and recurrences.
Full-layer resection of rectum is recommended in all cases of operations for benign tumors because of there is high risk of latent malignancy.
