[Comparative analysis of static scintigraphy and computerized tomography in assessment of remnant liver volume after advanced hepatic resection].
AIM
To perform a comparative analysis of computerized tomographic volumetry and scintigraphic liver volumetry in assessment of remnant liver volume after advanced hepatic resection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Static hepatobiliary scintigraphy and CT volumetry were performed in 45 patients with various liver tumors who underwent advanced hepatectomies (more than three segments).
RESULTS
There were no any significant differences in volumetric parameters obtained by CT and scintigraphic volumetry.  CONCLUSION
Scintigraphic volumetry data are similar to those of CT volumetry in evaluation of future remnant liver volume.  Scintigraphic volumetry may be used as an alternative in assessment of future remnant liver volume after advanced hepatic resections.
