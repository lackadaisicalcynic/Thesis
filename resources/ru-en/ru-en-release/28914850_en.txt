[Correction of small bowel function as a new direction for treating patients with metabolic syndrome].
AIM  To provide a rationale for and to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of the combined use of pancreatic enzymes and actovegin in the combination therapy of patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) on the basis of comprehensive clinical and functional studies of the small bowel (SB).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
In the course of treatment, 120 patients with MS (verified using the diagnostic criteria elaborated by the All-Russian Research Society of Cardiology (2009)) underwent a comprehensive study of SB function: an isolated study of resorptive processes; evaluation of parietal and cavitary digestion, motor-evacuation function.
The peripheral blood levels of gastrin, insulin, cortisol, thyroxine and thyrotropin were determined.
RESULTS
The combined use of pancreatic enzymes and actovegin has a positive impact on the clinical and functional state of SB, which was manifested as restoration of its hydrolysis and absorption, as well as motor-evacuation function in the patients with MS.
The treatment resulted in reductions in the levels of triglycerides from 2.85±0.34 to 1.53±0.18 mmol/l (p<0.01), total cholesterol from 6.08±0.16 to 5.19±0.21 mmol/l (p<0.05), and atherogenic factor from 5.21±0.28 to 2.93±0.34 (p<0.05).
Posttreatment HOMA-IR decreased from 4.22±0.8 to 2.12±0.8. There were no substantial changes in insulin levels and insulin resistance index in the patients on standard therapy.
CONCLUSION
The combined use of pancreatic enzymes and actovegin is pathogenetically sound in correcting SB dysfunctions and may be one of the most effective directions for the treatment of patients with MS.
