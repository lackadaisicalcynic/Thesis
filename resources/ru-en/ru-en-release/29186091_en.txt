[Managerial and methodological aspects of emergency surgery for malignant colonic obstruction].  AIM
To determine the most feasible treatment strategy for malignant colonic obstruction.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 427 patients with malignant colonic obstruction who were hospitalized for emergency indications.  30 of them were treated with medical therapy; 286 - underwent acute resection; 43 - stoma construction; 68 - stents deployment.
64 out of 427 patients underwent elective restorative/radical surgery and radio- or chemotherapy in 1-8 months.
3-year Kaplan-Meier survival was assessed.
RESULTS
Complications occurred in 58% after acute resection and in 32.6% and 8.8% after stoma and stent deployment, respectively.
Postoperative mortality was significantly lower after palliative surgery (stent or stoma) compared with acute resection: 2.9%, 18.6%, 29.37%, respectively.
3-year survival was higher after elective resections compared with emergency resection group: 0,81 Ð¸ 0,68 respectively.
CONCLUSION
Bridging strategy (stoma/stents) may be a valid alternative in some patients with malignant colonic obstruction due to significantly reduced postoperative mortality.
Acute surgery for malignant colonic obstruction should only be carried out by appropriately trained surgeons at multi-field hospital.
