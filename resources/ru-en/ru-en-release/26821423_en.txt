[A case of adenovirus infection complicated by gram-negative polymicrobial sepsis: A clinical and morphological observation].  Among respiratory infections, adenovirus infection (ADVI), in the presence of which there may be severe pneumonia that frequently results in a fatal outcome, occupies particular attention.
ADVI in patients without immunodeficiency is usually mild and shows a limited extent of injury.
At the same time the disease in immunocompromised individuals may be severe, presenting with viremia, evolving sepsis, and high death rates.
The paper gives a characteristic example of severe ADVI and its fatal outcome.
