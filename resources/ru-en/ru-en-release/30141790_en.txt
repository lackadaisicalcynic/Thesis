[Markers of gluten intolerance in children with autism spectrum disorders and Down'syndrome].
AIM  To study serological and genetic markers of gluten intolerance in children and teenagers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and Down's syndrome (DS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty-three children with ASD (group 1) and 8 with DS (group 2), aged from 2.5 to 15 years, were examined.  There were 27 boys and 6 girls in group1, 5 boys and 3 girls in group 2.
Most of the children were on a regular diet and only 4 children with ASD kept gluten-free diet (GFD).
Using ELI method antibodies to gliadin IgG (AntiGliadin IgG), antibodies to deamidated peptides of gliadin IgA (AntiDGP IgA), immunoglobulin A (IgA) were identified.  Haplotypes HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 were determined using PCR.
RESULTS
AntiGliadin IgG were identified in 12.1% (4) patients of group 1, with the exception of patients on GFD in 13.8%, and in 50% patients of group 2.
One child with ASD had selective IgA deficiency.
Haplotypes predisposing to celiac disease had 41.9% of patients of group 1 and 37.5% of patients of group 2.  In ASD, the distribution of genotypes was as follows: DQ2 (64.3%), DQ8 (28.6%), DQ2/DQ8 (7.1%,).
In DS, all patients had haplotype DQ2.  AntiDGP IgA were not identified in both groups.
CONCLUSION
The predominant form of gluten intolerance in children with ASD and DS is sensitivity to gluten, which can be identified in 40-50% of patients.
Celiac disease, an autoimmune form of gluten intolerance, can be diagnosed in single cases, although predisposition to it is identified in 41.9% - 37.5% patients with ASD and DS, respectively.
Before the start of GFD, laboratory tests should be made to identify forms of gluten intolerance and the use of GFD.
