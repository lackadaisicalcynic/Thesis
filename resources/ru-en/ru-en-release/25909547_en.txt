[Comparative results of open robot-assisted and laparoscopic distal pancreatic resection].  It was performed a retrospective analysis of the results of distal pancreatic resections (DPR) in 89 patients with different tumors.
Conventional open operations were performed in 60 patients, robot-assisted - in 19 patients, laparoscopic - in 10 cases.  Absolute indication for open surgery was pancreatic cancer T3-4 stages.
Mini-invasive distal resections (robot-assisted and laparoscopic) were performed in cases of pancreatic cancer T1-2 stages, benign tumors and tumors with low potential of malignancy and diameter up to 4-5 cm.
Results of robot-assisted and laparoscopic interventions are similar but robot-assisted technique provides more precise surgery.
It improves quality of lymphadenectomy, decreases probability of intraoperative bleeding.
Duration of robot-assisted and open operation did not differ significantly.  Blood loss was significantly lower in group of robot-assisted method (mean 470 ml) while in cases of open and laparoscopic techniques this parameter was 1013.8 and 833.3 ml respectively.
Postoperative complications in open, laparoscopic and robot-assisted groups developed in 45.1, 52.6 and 50% of observations respectively.
Pancreatic fistulas were revealed in 58.8, 80 and 58.3% of cases respectively.
There were not deaths after laparoscopic and robot-assisted pancreatic resections.  2 patients died after open surgery.
