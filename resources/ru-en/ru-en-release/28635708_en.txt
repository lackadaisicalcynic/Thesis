[The early diagnosis of neurodegenerative changes in multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome based on optical coherence tomography of the retina].
AIM
To study signs of neurodegeneration in the retina in multiple sclerosis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We studied the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in 265 (524 eyes) patients.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  We identified a reliable thinning of RNFL of both eyes in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS).
A comparative analysis by sectors revealed a specific decrease in RNFL in temporal segments and papillomacular beam.  Mean values of RNFL in patients with clinically isolated syndrome did not differ from those in controls.
Thickening of RNFL of low segments (NI Ð¸ TI) and decrease in the thickness of the upper temporal segment (TS) were found.
The results have demonstrated that neurodegenerative signs in the retina may be early appearances of MS.  Optical coherence tomography allows to perform objective and rapid screening of retinal neurodegenerative changes.
