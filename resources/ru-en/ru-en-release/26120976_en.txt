[Cerebrospinal fluid in clinical aspects of tuberculosis of the central nervous system].  OBJECTIVE
To identify clinical features of tuberculosis of the meninges and central nervous system (TM) with detailed characterization of changes in the composition of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the initial period of the disease.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We analyzed the results of the examination of 42 patients, aged from 17 to 49 years, who were hospitalized in 2005-2014.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Most of the patients were admitted in the hospital in early acute disease onset.  Along with the description of inflectional and cerebral symptoms, meningeal signs, disorders of consciousness and focal symptoms, we presented cell count values, protein and glucose concentrations at initial examination of CSF as well as the results of additional examination and specific therapy issues.
The importance of combining treatment standards and individualization of therapy of TM patients is emphasized.
