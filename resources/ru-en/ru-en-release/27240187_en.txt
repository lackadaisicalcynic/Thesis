[Idiopathic intracranial hypertension].  Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition due to high intracranial pressure in the absence of an intracranial mass lesion, venous thrombosis or brain infection.
It mostly occurs in young obese females.  Currently, the incidence of IIH in obese women is estimated to be 12 per 100,000 people per year.
Epidemiological data demonstrate the increase in incidence in this group: 323 cases per 100,000.
IIH can cause visual loss in 1-2% of the patients during the year before the diagnosis and beginning of treatment.
IIH treatment is a complex multidisciplinary problem that includes a body-mass reduction program, conservative pharmacological treatment, prolonged ophthalmological study and, if necessary, timely neurosurgical treatment.
