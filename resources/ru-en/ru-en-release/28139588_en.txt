[The experience of submental intubation for severe maxillofacial injuries].
Oral and nasal routes for intubation are often not feasible in maxillofacial fractures.  The paper presents our experience of midline and paramedial approaches for submental intubation in the airway management of facial trauma patients.
The prospective study included 47 patients with maxillofacial trauma in whom submental orotracheal intubation was performed in 2005-2014.
When using midline approach the tube does not always accurately fit into the mandibular lingual groove creating an inconvenience for the surgeon.  By paramesial approach the working conditions for the surgeon were the most comfortable.
The average duration of the procedure was 5-6 minutes.
At the end of the surgery the tube was reversed, the submental wound was stitched, patients were extubated (10 of them were extubated through the submental approach).
Eight patients required short-term post-operative mechanical ventilation.
In all patients the submental intubation allowed simultaneous reduction and fixation of fractures and intraoperative control of the dental occlusion without interference from the tube during the operation.
There were no significant operative or postoperative complications.  Submental intubation is a simple, secure and effective procedure for operative airway control in maxillofacial traumas.
It is an attractive alternative to tracheotomy in the surgical management of selected cases of maxillofacial trauma.
