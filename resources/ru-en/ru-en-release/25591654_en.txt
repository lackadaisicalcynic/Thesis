Objective.  To compare pharmacokinetic parameters of mexidol (coated tablets, "Farmasoft") and mexiprim (tablets film-coated, "STADA CIS").
Material and methods.
The study included 14 adult male Chinchilla rabbits.  Concentration of 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate in the blood plasma of animals was analyzed using HPLC with UV detection.
Results and conclusion.  Mexidol as compared to mexiprim was more completely and rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, it was confirmed by the higher value of maximal concentration of 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine succinate and less maximal concentration time after mexidol administration.
The drugs had similar excretion that was confirmed by the lack of significant differences in the values of total clearance, half-life, and the average retention time.
