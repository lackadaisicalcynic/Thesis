AIM  To estimate the results of sternomediastinitis management using vacuum-therapy compared with conventional treatment of such wounds.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We have retrospectively analyzed data for the period from January 2007 to October 2014.  The study enrolled 79 patients with infectious complication after cardiac surgery.
All patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.  The first group included 40 patients who received conventional therapy.
The second group enrolled 39 patients in whom vacuum-therapy was applied.  Patients were comparable in main characteristics.
RESULTS  Mortality rate was significantly lower in vacuum-therapy group (2.5% vs. 15%, p=0.05).
Similarly duration of hospital-stay in the 2nd group was 29±10 days, in the 1st group - 47±11 days (p<0.01).
Incidence of sepsis and other complications was significantly higher in group of conventional treatment.
CONCLUSION
Vacuum-therapy for infectious complications after cardiac surgery provided good results including decrease of hospital-stay duration and mortality rate in comparison with conventional management of wounds.
