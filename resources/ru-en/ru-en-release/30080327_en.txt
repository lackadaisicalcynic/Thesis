[Histometric symptoms of age-sensitive changes of bone tissue.]  The study presents the results of a complex histomorphometric research of the features of the age-related dynamics of bone tissue.
As a study material we used samples of the distal epiphysis and diaphysis of the left tibia from 348 corpses of males with a known age from 0 to 90 years.  A group of microosteometric features, that have the strongest correlation with age, is established in different age groups; their quantitative characteristics are given.
It is clarified that the trends of age-related changes in the structural components of bone tissue correspond to the basic patterns of growth, remodeling, depend on the species and their localization.
Conceptual positions of age involution of bone tissue are proposed.
