OBJECTIVE  To study the relationship between impairment of attention and development of pathological fatigue and depression after non-disabling stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Thirty patients were examined.
Attention was assessed by the Attention Network Test (ANT).  Pathological fatigue and depression were assessed by the Fatigue assessment scale and depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The association between the severity of depression and fatigue after stroke and reduction of mean reaction time in ANT was found.
A decrease in the reaction time may be one of the factors reducing working ability in patients with post-stroke fatigue and depression even in the absence of severe neurological deficit.  This has to be taken into account when planning rehabilitation.
