[The use of Pantogam syrup in treating small children's breath holding spells].
AIM  To study the efficacy of pantogam syrup 10% (hopantenic acid) in the treatment of breath-holding spells (BHS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty children, aged from 2 to 4 years, with BHS were studied.
The evaluation of clinical manifestations and anxiety level was performed.
Results of neurophysiological examination (long-term video-EEG-monitoring) were analyzed.
Children were divided into 2 groups: main, in which the patients received pantogam syrup, and control group, in which only psychological methods were used.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The results of the clinical and neurophysiological studies performed after the treatment, showed the clinical improvement in 73.3% of patients of the main group compared with similar data from the children in the control group (16.7%).
The anxiety level significantly decreased after the neuroprotective therapy.  A comparative analysis of electroencephalographic indicators demonstrated a significant (Ñ€<0.05) reduction in the power range of slow rhythms and manifestations of functional immaturity of the brain in patients of the main group.
These results give evidence for the high efficacy of pantogam syrup in the treatment of children with BHS.
