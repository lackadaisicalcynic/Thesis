[The efficacy of desmopressin in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus after resection of chiasmo-sellar region tumors].  Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a neuroendocrine disease, the pathogenesis of which is associated with abnormal secretion of the antidiuretic hormone.
One of the specific causes of CDI is neurosurgical resection of chiasmatic-sellar region tumors.  AIM
to study the efficacy and safety of desmopressin in CDI patients after resection of chiasmatic-sellar region (CSR) tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Examination and treatment of patients were performed at a hospital for 7-14 days after surgery and then were continued after discharge.
During treatment, the following tests were performed: a daily fluid intake and excretion volume, serum levels of sodium, potassium, and glucose twice a day, morning urine specific gravity, and Zimnitsky's test.
RESULTS
Twenty-three patients with CSR tumors (11 craniopharyngiomas, 10 pituitary adenomas, 1 skull base chordoma, and 1 CSR meningioma) and CDI after neurosurgical treatment received desmopressin.
On treatment, a thirst decrease, a reduced rate of diuresis, a reduced amount of excreted urine, and normalization of the sodium level were observed in all patients.
In 12 patients (with pituitary adenoma, skull base chordoma, and meningioma) with transient CDI, desmopressin therapy was discontinued upon regression of symptoms 7-30 days after surgery.
Eleven patients with permanent CDI continued to receive the drug at a dose of 1 to 4 doses per day.
All patients well tolerated the drug without significant adverse effects.
CONCLUSION
Therapy with desmopressin in the form of a nasal spray (vazomirin) in patients with transient and permanent CDI after resection CSR tumors of various histological nature (craniopharyngiomas, pituitary adenomas, meningiomas, and chordomas) was effective and safe in the early postoperative and long-term postoperative periods.
