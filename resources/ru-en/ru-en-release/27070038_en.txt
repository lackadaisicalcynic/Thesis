[The application of osteoscintigraphy in forensic medical practice for the detection and differentiation of bone fractures in the living human].  This paper is designed to present an example from the domestic expert practice with the successful application of the radionuclide technique to visualize the bone lesions in a victim of a traffic accident having concomitant pathology of the osseous-articular apparatus (Scheuermann-Mau disease).
The use of the osteoscintigraphic method made it possible not only to confirm the injury to the spinal column and the sternum but also to ensure its differential diagnostics from the concurrent pathology.  Also, the method allowed to detect the exact location of the fractures.
