[Treatment of resistant arterial hypertension in the remote period after carotid endarterectomy].  The aim of the study was to determine peculiarities of the course of resistant arterial hypertension (AH) in the remote period after performing the operation of carotid endarterectomy in patients presenting with haemodynamically significant (more than 70%) stenosis of the carotid bifurcation.
The study included a total of 105 patients.
The course of AH was evaluated in the immediate (2-7 days) and remote (3-7 years) periods after the operation of carotid endarterectomy.
Ninety-two (87.6%) patients presenting prior to the operation with resistant AH were postoperatively found to have persistent stabilization of arterial pressure and its milder course.
A good clinical effect (possibility of reaching the target arterial pressure) in the remote period was noted to preserve in 65.7% of patients.
The proportion of patients with grade III AH decreased from 43.8% (prior to operation) to 5.8% in the remote postoperative period (p<0.001).
It was also determined that the degree of the antihypertensive effect after the performed operation of carotid endarterectomy depended upon the duration of a previous medical history of arterial hypertension before surgery: the sooner the operation is performed the more pronounced its antihypertensive effect is.
