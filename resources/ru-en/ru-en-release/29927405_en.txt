RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The logistic regression model connecting LE and α1-PI with the probability of AD is built.
The model has good statistical properties and high predictive efficiency.  The results allow to obtain the quantitative estimate of the probability of AD by individual values of LE and α1-PI in patients with MCI.
