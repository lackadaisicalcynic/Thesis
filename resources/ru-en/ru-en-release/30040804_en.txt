[The quality of medical care of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the Russian Federation].  The quality of medical care for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the Russian Federation is analyzed taking into account the cooperation of patients.
Two hundred and fifty-one patients with ALS were observed.
Ninety-nine patients, including 16 who were followed up, were examined.  Other patients (n=152) were consulted indirectly including 28 followed up.
It has been shown that 79.8% of the patients are characterized by the low level of cooperation with neurologists regardless of the quality of medical care; 8.3% of patients are managed in facilities (or by physicians), which donot use the International standard of ALS management.  Only 11.9% of patients receive medical care in accordance with this standard and in these cases, the high level of cooperation of the patients with medical services was recorded.
A dual system that combines the services provided by medical insurance, private treatment facilities, charity organizations, structures of medical/social care with different levels of availability and methods of consumer-provider interactions is the most effective.
