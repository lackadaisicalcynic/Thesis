[Clinical and laboratory rationale for galvanophoresis of hydroxide copper-calcium by root canals treatment].
Double blind study presents clinical and laboratory estimation of root canal system (RC) cleaning by endodontic treatment of apical periodontitis by means of galvanophoresis of hydroxide copper-calcium (GP HCC).
In 60 patients the amount and composition of RC fluid from incisors and canines by GP HCC were estimated within 2 weeks with three different galvano-pair and the efficiency of RC decontamination were compared by standard report irrigation and GP HCC.
The intensity of electroosmotic allocation of RC liquid by GP HCC is gradually increased at 4-5 day, and then slowly reduced at 10-12 day.
The RC liquid contained proteins and carbohydrates - typical rests of pulp and biofilm.
GP HCC suppresses aerobic and anaerobic microflora in RC 65.5% more effectively than standard irrigation and may be seen as an alternative method of endodontic treatment of apical periodontitis.
