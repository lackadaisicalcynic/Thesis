[Retrospective analysis of clinical, radiological, and histopathological presentation of periocular dermoid cysts].
UNLABELLED
Aim - to determine the contribution of clinical and radiological findings to proper diagnosis of dermoid cysts and treatment decision making and also, to identify their distinctive histopathological features.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
This is a retrospective analysis of —Ålinical signs, assessment
RESULTS  and treatment outcomes in 52 patients with orbital dermoids.
RESULTS  The patients enrolled mostly complained of painless non-inflammatory swelling of the upper eyelid that spatially corresponded to the cyst.
None of the patients developed diplopia, exophthalmos, or change in refraction.  Computed tomography revealed round or oval shapes with clear and smooth contours.
CONCLUSION
Having analyzed clinical, radiological, and histopathological presentation of dermoid cysts, we conclude that, if interpreted correctly, clinical signs together with assessment results provide reliable diagnosis prior to surgery.
