[Perforated cholecystitis.  Classification and atypical clinical forms].
To obtain new data for diagnosis and treatment of patients with perforated cholecystitis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was analyzed the variants of original classification of perforated cholecystitis by Fedorov S.P. - Neimeier O.W. (1934).  Moreover, we have assessed treatment of 292 patients with gallbladder perforation (own material of Faculty Surgery Clinic).
RESULTS
According to continuous 20-year follow-up perforated cholecystitis was observed in 2.9% of patients with various forms of gallbladder inflammation (n=292 out of 10 215).
The frequency of atypical clinical forms of gallbladder perforation including multiple and combined perforation, perforation with acute intestinal obstruction and intraabdominal bleeding was 10% (n=29 of 292).
Overall mortality in atypical clinical forms related to whole cohort with perforated cholecystitis was 2% (n=6 of 292).
CONCLUSION
Atypical clinical forms of gallbladder perforation require specific treatment strategy due to the need for emergency surgical interventions.
At the same time, the possibilities of video-assisted surgery are somewhat limited compared with other forms of gallbladder inflammation and can be used only in a third of patients.
