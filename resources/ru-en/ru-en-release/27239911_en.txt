[Ribs osteosynthesis in patients with isolated and combined chest trauma].
INTRODUCTION  Rapid methods of costal fractures fixation using special costal plates are becoming more common.
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy of ribs osteosynthesis in patients with isolated and combined chest trauma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It is presented an experience of surgical treatment of patients with costal fractures in case of isolated (30) and combined (29) chest injury.
System for ribs osteosynthesis was used predominantly in surgical tactics.
RESULTS
Immediate surgical results were analyzed.
Most patients had increase of blood gas parameters, oxygenation in the postoperative period.
In case of isolated chest injury mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 1.3±1.1, incidence of complications - 3.3%, mortality rate - 0%.
In group of combined injuries those indexes were 4.6±3.05, 13.8% and 13.8% respectively.
CONCLUSION
The method of ribs osteosynthesis in patients with isolated and combined chest trauma showed high efficiency.
