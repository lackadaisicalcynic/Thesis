[Age features peripheral link erythron rats and its status with experimental cardiosclerosis].
Studied the performance of the peripheral unit erythrone rats aged 4 months (1st group) 12 months (2nd group) and 24 months (3rd group).
Each age group (n=20) consisted of 10 intact animals and 10 animals c postinfarction cardiosclerosis (PICS).
In the group of animals 24 months of age was showed an increase in the number of erythrocytes in the absence of difference in the amount of reticulocytes.  Expressed anisocytosis and decrease in hemoglobin synthesis in animals of this age group suggests that the age-related disorders maturation of erythroid cells.
The development of post-infarction myocardial remodeling has not affected polycythemia typical for animals of older age group.
At the same time a significant increase in the reticulocyte count of peripheral blood smears was observed for this group of animals.
Development of PICS for animals extreme age groups leads to a smoothing interage differences, noted in the animals in the intact condition.
