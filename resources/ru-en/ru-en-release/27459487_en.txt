[Errors in crural perforant veins ligation].
AIM  to assess topographic features and technical aspects of perforant veins ligation in patients with trophic disorders due to varicose disease.
RESULTS
There were 13-16 perforant veins of anterior tibial group and 3-8 veins of posterior tibial group which were predominantly localized along Linton line.  Also there were 4-6 perforant veins of peroneal group.
Postoperative control revealed that 41.63% of veins were missed during surgery regardless method of ligation.
Anatomical analysis showed that relationship with deep fascia cruris is determinant factor for errors and dangers of remote ligation of perforant veins and creates high risk of deep vein injury.
One of available method to avoid errors during ligation is thorough examination of the wound and use of Turner-Warwick test to confirm dissection of perforant vein and its incompetence. 100% effect of ligation was achieved in all cases after this test.  Perforant veins ligation is single pathogenetic treatment for varicose disease class C4-C6.
Perforant veins should be ligated under visual control.  Intraoperative tests are also advisable.
