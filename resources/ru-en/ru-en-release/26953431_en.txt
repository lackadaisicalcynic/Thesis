[The impact of internal TMJ disorders on quality of life of patients with malocclusion].  Articular disturbances of temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) combined with dentofacial anomalies (DFA) decrease the quality of life.
The objective of the study was ti determine dental quality of life in patients with "internal disturbances" of TMJ combined with DFA.  Questionnaire survey (Oral Health Impact Profile OHIP-14-RU) of 96 young patients was carried out.
The patients were treated due to DFA combined with "internal disturbances" of TMJ.
It should be pointed out that patients with hyperdivergent skeletal pattern have the most evident trend towards setting the quality of life to zero in dental sphere.  Moreover, the trend is more evident in the case of patients with dento-alveolar types of occlusion anomalies.
Patients with dento-alveolar type of open occlusion have maximum points in "Psychological discomfort", "Psychological disability", and "Social disability".  Patients with distal occlusion and hyperdivergence of jaw bones have maximum points in "Psychological disability" and "Social incapacity".
Patients with the combination of distal occlusion and deep incisal occlusion have maximum points in "Psychological discomfort" and "Social disability".  Patients with "internal disturbances" of TMJ combined with DFA reveal a negative shift of questionnaire information.
The maximal rates were revealed in "Psychological disability" and "Social disability", the minimal ones--in "Functional limitation" and "Handicap".
