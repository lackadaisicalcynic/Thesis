[Age-related peculiarities of acute cholecystitis].  In the present study the analysis of dynamics of basic laboratory parameters of patients with acute cholecystitis (AC) in the four age groups subdivided according to the WHO classification into young, middle age, elderly and senile was carried out.
The most pronounced changes were found in the senile age group in which the AC was accompanied by the decreased number of erythrocytes, low hemoglobin and total protein, leukocytosis, lower percentage of lymphocytes and the highest levels of ALT, AST, bilirubin and urea.
Changes in the elderly and senile groups differed and in a number of cases were opposite.
In the elderly and especially in the senile group the dynamics of the studied parameters related to surgery, was poorly expressed.
These findings can be used in the preparation of the elderly and senile patients for AC surgery.
