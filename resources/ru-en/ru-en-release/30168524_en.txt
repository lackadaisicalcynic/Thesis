[The morphological characteristic of the cerebellar cortex in the case of a burning injury].  The objective of the present study was the development of the additional forensic medical criteria for the diagnostics of the intravitality and prescription of the burning injury making use of the morphological changes in the cerebellar cortex.
A total of 82 cases of the death from the second- and third a, b-degree flame burns in 63 men and 19 women at the age from 20 to 65 years were available for the analysis.
The condition of the cerebellar cortex was evaluated within 0 to 72 hours after the trauma had been inflicted.
The routine histological staining technique using hematoxylin and eosin were employed as well as the Nisslin staining carried out in the combination with the immunohistochemical reaction based on the application of the antibodies against the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).
In the case of death during the acute period after the burning injury, the histological study revealed a characteristic complex of the morphological features including the acute swelling of neurons, the increasing expansion of perivascular and pericellular spaces, as swell as hyperoxyphilia of microglia.
The astrocytes of cortical II-III layers proved highly sensitive to tissue hypoxia as appears from their reaction with anti-GFAP antibodies.
It is concluded that the results of the evaluation of the blood supply of the cerebral hemisphere cortex with the use of immunohistochemical methods may be helpful as the additional criteria for the purpose of forensic medical documentation of intravitality and prescription of the burning injury.
