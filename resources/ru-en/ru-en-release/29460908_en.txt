[Association of sleep disorders with headache].
AIM  The aim of the present study was to investigate the connection of sleep disorders (SD) with a headache (HA) among the representative sample of population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
1115 inhabitants of Chuvashia (491 men and 624 women) aged from 18 to 70 years old have been interviewed (middle age 38.7Â±13.9 years old); respondents under 18 and over 70 years old were not included into the research.  There were 690 city residents, and 425 residents of the rural areas.
The questionnaire approved earlier in the research of HA, and also the questions directed to identification of SD were used.  One-way ANOVA, Chi-square test were used to compare variables of the groups.
RESULTS
There were 718 (64.4%) respondents with SD and HA (the main group), 366 (23.8%) with HA without SD (comparative group), 16 (1.4%) with SD without HA, and 15 (1.3%) without SD and HA.
The main group of the respondents authentically differed from other groups in older age, a larger number of women and villagers, presence of concomitant diseases in them.
In the respondents with SD arose more often, pain had the combined (polymorphic) character, HA were more severe, localized in several areas of the head, but were of smaller duration.
Among them there were more people with short sleep duration (<5 hours of night dream) and accepting sedative-hypnotic medications.
HA without SD had a pricking character more often; the respondents more often slept in the afternoon, differed in higher level of education, and a rarer occurrence of cases of the increased arterial pressure.
CONCLUSION
SD are often connected with HA, with their frequency, expressiveness and localization.
Development of SD from HA are influenced by existence of concomitant diseases, age, gender and the place a residence.
SD make the current of HA more severe.
