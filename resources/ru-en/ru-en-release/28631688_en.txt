[Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: modern concepts of its etiology and pathogenesis].  The objective of the present review of the literature is the analysis of the currently available data concerning etiology and pathogenesis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).
The special emphasis is placed on the modern hypotheses of BPPV formation that collectively account for not more than 15% of all known cases of this condition.
The best explored are the following causes of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: vestibular neuronitis, head injuries, and disorders in the middle ear.
During the recent years, much attention has been given to the role of disturbances of calcium metabolism and osteoporosis in etiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.
It is supposed that pathogenesis of vertiginous attacks can be explained in terms of the canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis theories.
