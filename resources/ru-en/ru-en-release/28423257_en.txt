[Acute myocardial infarction in elderly and senile patients: epidemiology study according to the who program "registry of acute myocardial infarction].
The article presents results of the epidemiology study of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among permanent Tomsk residents older than 60 years.
The study was conducted in 2008-2009 according to the WHO program «Registry of Acute Myocardial Infarction».
Data demonstrated that morbidity and mortality from AMI was higher in the above mentioned age group than in younger population.  Rates of morbidity and mortality in men exceeded those in women in all age groups except population older than 80 years.
The study showed high in-hospital lethality caused by high death rates in patients 60 years of age and older who were treated in non-specialized hospitals.
Authors conclude that the severity of epidemiology situation with AMI is determined by the frequency of this pathology in population older than 60 years suggesting the necessity of change in the strategy of system development of medical care for AMI patients with focus on the older age groups.
