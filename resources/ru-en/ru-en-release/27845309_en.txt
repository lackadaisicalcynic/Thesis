[Clinical characteristics of pain syndrome in patients with multiple myeloma].
AIM  To study pain syndrome characteristics in the trunk and extremities of patients with multiple myeloma (MM).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 120 patients with MM, aged from 34 to 83 years.
The duration of disease was 2-37 months.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The pain syndrome of trunk and extremity localization was revealed in 94% patients, its intensity according to the VAS was 65.5Â±25.4 mm.  At all stages of disease, moderate to severe pain, predominantly related to polyneuropathy (PNP), radiculopathy and osteodestruction, was more frequent.
Radicular pain syndrome was revealed in 46% of all MM patients, and in the majority of cases (92%), there were bone destruction lesions.  The character of pain in MM should be specified to optimize further management of the patient.
