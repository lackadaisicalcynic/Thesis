[Surgical technique of retropupillary iris-claw fixated IOL reimplantation].  Prevention and treatment of cataract surgery complications in patients with lens subluxation remains one of the current problems of phaco surgeries.
PURPOSE  To develop and to test the surgical technique for reimplantation of in-the-bag dislocated intraocular lenses (IOL) or sulcus-fixated IOL.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Surgical outcomes of 150 patients (150 eyes) with in-the-bag IOL dislocation (122 eyes) or sulcus fixated IOL dislocation (28 eyes) were analyzed.
The follow-up period lasted 1-3 years.
RESULTS
In all cases the dislocated IOL was removed and retropupillary iris-claw 'Artisan' IOL implantation was performed.
After the IOL exchange, visual acuity improved in all patients, while the fixation of retropupillary IOL remained stable.
CONCLUSION
This surgical technique of dislocated IOL exchange coupled with retropupillary implantation of 'Artisan' IOL provides reliable anatomic and functional results.
