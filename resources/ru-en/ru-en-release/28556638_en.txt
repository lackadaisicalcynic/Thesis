[Role of PLAT, PKHD1L1, STK38L and TEAD1 genes Alu-polymorphism for longevity].  The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of Alu(I/D)-polymorphic sites in PLAT (TPA25), PKHD1L1 (Yb8AC702), STK38L (Ya5ac2145) Ð¸ TEAD1 (Ya5ac2013) genes was first characterized in the ethnically homogeneous group (Tatars from the Republic of Bashkortostan, Russia), and was established (found) the association of each gene polymorphism with age.
The study group consisted of 1580 unrelated individuals aged between 21 and 109 years, including 204 long-livers.
It was found that STK38L*I/D genotype had positive association with longevity in the total group (OR=1,016, p=0,034).
Long-lived women had a high probability of detection of PKHD1L1*I/I (OR=1,289, p=0,009), PLAT*D/D (OR=1,175, p=0,016) and TEAD1*I/I (OR=1,047, p=0,042) genotypes.
PKHD1L1*I/D genotype was a significant factor in providing of male longevity (OR=1,713, p=0,030).
Therefore, age-dependent changes in genotype frequencies are specific for each studied gene.
