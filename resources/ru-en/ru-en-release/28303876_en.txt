[Ultrasonic examination of the breast adipose grafts after mammoplasty].
AIM
To present the results of PRP-adipose grafts implanatation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 25 patients after transplantation of autologous adipose tissue.
Autotransplantation was performed to correct volume defects of breast and to restore lost volume after polyacrylamide gel removal in 4 patients; after mastectomy in 6 cases; after complicated replacement using silicone endoprostheses in 11 patients; after previous reduction in 2 cases; after augmentation mammoplasty in 2 cases.
Mean age of patients was 42 years.
Patients were divided into 2 groups.
Group 1 included 12 patients in whom pure adipose tissue was transplanted.
Group 2 consisted of 13 patients who received autologous fat with platelet-rich plasma (PRP).
RESULTS
Dynamic ultrasonic monitoring showed early resorption processes (liponecrosis foci) after autologous fat injection.
Locally increased vascular pattern of breast tissue is an inflammatory sign requiring anti-inflammatory therapy.
PRP-adipose grafts have improved outcomes.
