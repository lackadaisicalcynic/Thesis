[Farmacological effects of anti-S 100 in release-active form and mechanisms of their realization].  Antibodies to 5100 proteins (anti-5100) in release-active form (RA anti-5100) are an active component of some domestic drugs(tenoten, tenoten for children, divaza, brizantin, kolofort and proproten-100).
The authors present the results of preclinical and clinical trials (with detailed consideration of experimental data) which demonstrated a wide spectrum of specific pharmacological activity and safety as well as mechanisms of anti-5100 action.
