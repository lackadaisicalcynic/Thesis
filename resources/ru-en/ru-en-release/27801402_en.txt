[Supraorbital keyhole craniotomy in surgery of anterior circle of willis aneurysms].  The progress in surgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms is based on the introduction of modern minimally invasive techniques.
Among the variety of keyhole approaches, supraorbital craniotomy is most often used in surgical treatment of anterior circle of willis aneurysms.
The authors present the preliminary results of application of supraorbital keyhole craniotomy for anterior circle of willis aneurysms in 27 patients.
Most of the patients had unruptured aneurysms (18 patients).
Nine patients had SAH, and 4 of them were operated on in the acute period.
The patients' condition was assessed as a grade 1-2 (Hunt-Hess scale) and grade 1-3 (Fisher scale).
There were no intraoperative aneurysm ruptures, other serious complications, and deaths.
Postoperative complications were assessed at 2 weeks and 6 months.
The postoperative cosmetic outcome was assessed by patients as excellent.
