[A fixed-dose lisinopril+amlodipine+rosuvastatin combination: prospects for its use in patients with hypertension and concomitant dyslipidemia].
In Russia, target blood pressure (BP) levels are achieved in only 14.4% of men and in 30.9% of women.
The need for combination therapy of hypertension is as high as 70.7%.
There are well-known benefits of combined antihypertensive therapy allowing for higher efficiency and better tolerability.  One of the current combinations is a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium antagonist, which have pronounced protective activity and metabolic neutrality.
Fixed-dose combinations have substantial advantages over free ones, contributing to improving patient compliance with the used treatment regimen.  Dyslipidemia is present in 60.7% of the hypertensive patients.
Nonetheless, only 9.7% of Russian patients with coronary heart disease take statins and control of lipid levels remains very poor.  The review discusses whether the use of the triple combination lisinopril + amlodipine + rosuvastatin is reasonable from the standpoint of evidence-based medicine.
There are literature data suggesting the high value of this fixed-dose combination in the context of organ protection and the reduced risk of cardiovascular events.
