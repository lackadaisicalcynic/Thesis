[Efficiency of triple antihypertensive therapy in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and depressive disorders].
AIM  To evaluate the efficiency of triple antihypertensive therapy in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and depressive disorders (DD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
153 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were examined, of whom 82 patients were diagnosed with mild and moderate DD.
A combination of perindopril 10 mg/day, indapamide SR 1.5 mg/day, and amlodipine at an initial dose of 5 mg/day was given to patients with hypertension and DD.
After 4 weeks of treatment, if target blood pressure (BP) levels could not be achieved, the dose of amlodipine was increased up to 10 mg/day.
General clinical examination and 24-hour BP monitoring (BPM) were performed in all the patients at baseline and in the patients with DD also after 24 weeks of therapy.
The traditional measures of the diurnal BP profile, as well as the parameters characterizing arterial stiffness and central aortic pressure (CAP) were estimated.
RESULTS
After 8 weeks of therapy, target BP levels were recorded in 63 (76.8%) patients.
After 24 weeks of treatment, the hypertensive patients with DD showed significant positive changes in all the investigated 24-hour BPM parameters and normalization of the diurnal BP profile in 65.1% of cases.
During the treatment, there were significant decreases in pulse wave velocity, brachial arterial and aortic augmentation indices, aortic systolic and diastolic pressures, and mean aortic BP and an increase in the velocity of the reflected wave.
CONCLUSION
Triple therapy, including perindopril, indapamide SR, and amlodipine, contributed to the achievement of target BP levels in the majority of hypertensive patients with DD, with significant positive changes in all 24-hour BPM parameters, optimization of the diurnal BP profile in most patients, clinically significant improvement of the parameters that characterize arterial stiffness and CAP.
