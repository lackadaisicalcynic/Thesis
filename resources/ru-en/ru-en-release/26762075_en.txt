[Cardiovascular disorders in case of acute gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with arterial hypertension].
AIM
To investigate the blood pressure changes and electrocardiogram parameters for the 1st day after acute gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with arterial hypertension.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Indexes of blood pressure monitoring and electrocardiogram in case of acute gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with arterial hypertension were studied.
45 patients with arterial hypertension and acute gastrointestinal bleeding, 63 patients in acute stage of bleeding without hypertension and 48 patients suffering from hypertension without gastrointestinal bleeding were studied.  Parallel simple open controlled investigation included blood pressure monitoring and Holter monitoring.
RESULTS
Circadian dynamics of blood pressure in patients with arterial hypertension on the background of gastrointestinal bleeding was noted by reduced variability and insufficient reduction of pressure at night.
Diastolic pressure decreased in accordance with severity of blood loss.
Holter monitoring revealed high incidence of supraventricular ectopic activity, sinus arrhythmia and significant elongation of the ventricular electrical systole.
