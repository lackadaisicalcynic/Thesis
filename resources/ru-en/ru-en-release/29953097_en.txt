[Experience of reconstructive laparoscopic procedures in patients with terminal colostomy].  AIM
To analyze the ways and terms of training for laparoscopy-assisted reconstruction operations via learning curves analysis and to compare the outcomes obtained both during training for technique and after that.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 93 reconstructive laparoscopic procedures in 58 (62.36%) patients with terminal colostomy.  All patients were operated by the same surgeon.
Learning curves have been created and analyzed.
RESULTS  Analysis showed that all surgical features are achieved by the 30th intervention indicating the end of learning period.
Significantly less surgical trauma has been observed along with development of surgery.
CONCLUSION
Improved results are achieved by reduced dissection of adhesions, the use of mechanical suture for intestinal anastomosis and increased number of anastomoses made in intracorporeal fashion.
