[The quality of life in patients with a different types of myasthenia gravis].
AIM  Researching quality of life in patients with myasthenia gravis at different clinical variants of disease.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We studied 103 patients with myasthenia gravis.
A battery of tests and scales for assessment of neurological deficit and quality of life was used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Two types of disease have been identified in myasthenia gravis: favorable and unfavorable.
The minimal duration of disease before thymectomy is the main determinant of the best outcome.
Favorable clinical type of myasthenia gravis was found in patients with weakness in extraocular and limb muscles.
Factors associated with a poor quality of life included following: weakness in bulbar and respiratory muscles (p<0.003), endocrine comorbidities (p<0.01) or thymoma (p<0.005).
