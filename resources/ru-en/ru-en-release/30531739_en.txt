[In-hospital outcomes of carotid endarterectomy depending on severity of contralateral lesion].
AIM
To compare in-hospital outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEE) in patients with different lesion of contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
There were 730 CEE procedures in patients with bilateral ICA lesion for the period 2011-2016.  All patients were divided into 4 groups depending on contralateral ICA stenosis grade: group 1 - stenosis up to 60% (42.6%, n=311); group 2 - 60-90% (18.7%, n=137); group 3 - 90-99% (25.9%, n=189); group 4 - occlusion (12.7%, n=93).
Endpoints were unfavorable cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke/TIA, significant hemorrhage by BARC scale (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium).
RESULTS
In-hospital mortality and incidence of MI, stroke/TIA were similar in all groups.
However, there were no cardiovascular complications in patients with critical contralateral stenosis or occlusion.
Bleeding followed by redo surgery was the most frequent complication.
Overall incidence of adverse cardiovascular events did not exceed 1.23%.
CONCLUSION
There was no correlation between contralateral ICA stenosis and incidence of in-hospital adverse events including death, MI, stroke/TIA.
Currently, technique of CEE is well developed that is associated with low incidence of postoperative complications.
