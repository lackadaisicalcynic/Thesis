[Comprehensive physical antiedematous therapy in treatment of patients with lymphedema].  Presented in the article is retrospective analysis of the results of treatment of patients with lymphedema.
We treated a total of 33 patients with primary (n=6) and secondary (n=27) lymphedema.
Stage II lymphedema was diagnosed in 18 (54.5%) patients, stage III lymphedema in 15 (45.5%) patients.  The 33 patients had a total of 44 affected limbs (9 hands and 35 legs).
All patients were subjected to comprehensive physical antiedematous therapy including: manual lymph drainage massage, formation of compression bandage, selection of individual class 3 plain stitch compression knitwear, special complex of therapeutic exercises, care of the skin of the affected limb.  A positive effect was achieved in all cases.
In patients with upper limb lesions the volume of the extremity decreased averagely by 1'235.0±283.7 cm3 (22.6% of the baseline volume, p<0.005), in patients with lower limb lesions it decreased by 2'712.0±350.3 cm3 (22.1% of the initial volume, p<0.005).  The carried out therapeutic course resulted in improvement of quality of life at the expense of decrease of the deformity and improvement of the function of the limb, increase of the scope of movements in the joints, regression of trophic alterations, widening of possibilities of wearing footgear and clothes.
A conclusion was made that comprehensive antiedematous physical therapy is an effective method of treatment of patients with limb lymphedema, making it possible to attain regression of trophic disorders and to improve patients' quality of life.
