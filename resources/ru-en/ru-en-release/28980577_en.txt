[Depression and depression-related disorders after a subarachnoid hemorrhage].
Psychiatric disorders often develop after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH); the most frequent of them are depression and depression-related disorders (anxiety, apathy, pathological fatigue, posttraumatic stress disorder, etc.).  Both biological and psychological mechanisms may underlie the development of these disorders.
Depression and depression-related disorders decrease patients' quality of life and prevent the full recovery after SAH.
Identification and correction of these disorders should take a prominent place in the rehabilitation of post-SAH patients.
More research is needed in this area.
