[The investigation of blood cells of middle and old age in patients with bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by atomic force microscopy.  Similarities and differences with the biological animal model].
The investigation of reactive changes of blood cells in such diseases as COPD or asthma in people of different age groups is the very difficult problem.
Simulating the same conditions in animals that occur in humans with these diseases can serve as a reliable practical model.  It is possible because the changes which take places at the cellular level in animals might reflect a similar trend in the human body.
