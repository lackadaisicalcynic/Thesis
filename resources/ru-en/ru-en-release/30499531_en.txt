[The role of anti-VEGF therapy in geographic atrophy progression].  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a retinal disease associated with older age; it affects macula and leads to deterioration of central vision.
Geographic atrophy (GA) is described as advanced stage AMD.
Essentially, GA is the loss of some areas of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is necessary for normal functioning of the retina as it transports nutrients and ions, helps with production of growth factors and protects from photo-oxidation.  Based on literature data, GA in AMD can be subtyped as follows: drusen-related; associated with choroidal neovascularization; secondary to anti-VEGF treatment; subsequent to collapse of RPE detachment and RPE rupture.
Comparison of functional results of various examination methods suggests that presence of GA in patients with exudative AMD cannot be a counter-indication for anti-VEGF therapy, but these patients require careful monitoring involving high-technology methods of eye fundus visualization and personalized approach when choosing the treatment regimen.
