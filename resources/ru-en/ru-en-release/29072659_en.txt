[Characteristic of the microbiocenosis of the nasal mucous membrane in the patients presenting with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis].
The objective of the present work was to study the specific features of the microbiocenosis of the nasal mucous membrane in the patients presenting with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS).
We examined 86 patients with this condition at the age varying from 18 to 64 years.  The control group consisted of practically healthy blood donors (n=156) registered at the Krasnoyarsk Regional Blood Centre #1; they were matched to the patients of the main study group in terms of the age and sex.
In order to investigated bacterial flora of nasal mucosa from the standpoint of its role in the exacerbation of the disease, the microorganisms were cultured on the differential-diagnostic media.
Their individual species were identified with the use of the conventional microbiological methods.
They demonstrated the disturbances of the microbiocenosis of the nasal mucous membrane of the ABRS patients with the simultaneous increase of the total abundance of microorganisms regarded as potentially pathogenic ones.
The study of pathogenic and persistent properties of the Staphylococcus strains isolated from the nasal mucosa of the patients suffering from acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, revealed the presence of practically all species supposed to be etiopathogenic agents able to produce the enzymes responsible for pathogenicity and persistence of the microorganisms.
The results of the present study were interpreted as giving evidence of the disturbances of the microbiocenosis of the nasal mucosa resulting from the impairment of local immunity associated with trophic disorders in the mucous membrane of the nasal passages.
