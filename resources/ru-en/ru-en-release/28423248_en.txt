[Disulfiram inhibites the development of cataract in OXYS rats].  Surgical treatment remains the only way to restore vision in patients with cataract; this disorder is the most common reason for vision decline and vision loss in people older than 65 years.
It is estimated that a 10-year delay in the development of cataract will reduce the need for surgery twofold.
In 2012, Nagai and colleagues reported an anticataract effect of an inhibitor of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase-a widely used antialcoholism drug disulfiram (DSF) - in ICR/f rats with hereditary cataracts.
Accordingly, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the influence of DSF on the cataract in OXYS rats, which develop lens alterations similar to senile cataract in humans.
Instillation of DSF from age 1,5 to 3,5 months did not prevent but significantly slowed the development of cataracts in OXYS rats.
At concentrations of 0,25 % and 0,5 %, DSF reduced the severity of pathological changes in the lens 1,8-fold and was more effective than at the concentration 1 %. These data were consistent with the results of ophthalmoscopic histomorphological examination: the pharmacotherapy strongly reduced the (typical of cataract) structural damage to the capsule of the lens epithelium and to organization of its fibers.
Thus, disulfiram is a promising drug for the prevention of senile cataract in humans.
