[New possibilities of treatment of low back pain].
Low back pain (LBP) is a syndrome caused by degenerative spine diseases and a common reason for referral for medical care.  LBP is mostly often caused by osteoarthritis (OA) that needs long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
The treatment is associated with a risk of side-effects.  The authors consider the possibility of using slow-acting drugs for symptomatic treatment of OA (SYSADOA) in patients with LBP and present the data on anti-inflammatory effects of chondroitin sulfate on the chondral tissue in OA.
The results of the studies on the use of SYSADOA in LBP are analyzed.
