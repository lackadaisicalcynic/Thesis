[Antibodies to native and denatured DNA in the serum of patients with schizophrenia depending on the clinical features of the disease].  OBJECTIVE
To study the correlations between the level of antibodies to native and denatured DNA and psychopathological symptoms and illness duration in patients with schizophrenia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The level of antibodies to native (double-stranded) DNA and denatured (single-stranded) DNA was studied in the serum of 50 patients with schizophrenia, including 12 patients with tardive dyskinesia (TD).  The control group consisted of 30 people.
RESULTS
A significant twofold increase in antibodies to native DNA was detected in patients with TD.
There was no correlation of the amount of antibodies to double-stranded DNA with the duration of disease and leading symptoms both between the groups of patients as well as in comparison with controls.
A significant decrease in antibody levels to the denatured (single-stranded) DNA was found in schizophrenic patients compared to the control group (p=0.009).
A significant decrease in the concentration of antibodies to single-stranded DNA in patients with increasing duration of the disease, as well as in patients with leading negative symptoms was revealed.
CONCLUSION
The results suggest that anti-DNAantibodies may not play a major role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
