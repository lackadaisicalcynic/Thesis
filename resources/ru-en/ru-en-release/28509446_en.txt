[Stochastic simulation of the process of matching of the ages of the human and the experimental mammalian].  The aim of the article is to work out the simple approach for matching of the ages of the human and mammalian.
The model is based on the analysis of the counting processes of the proper ontogenetic events (such as the emergence of the first molars, the first ovulation, almost complete cessation of growth, menopause).  The choice of the events is reduced to the claim of being observable.
The matching (and proper concordance) are useful for the choice of the individual regimens of medical treatment.
