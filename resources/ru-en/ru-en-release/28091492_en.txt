[The experience with the early rehabilitation of the children presenting with the vertebral cerebrospinal injury].  This article was designed to report the experience with the provision of early rehabilitation care to the children suffering from a spinal-cord injury (SCI) that was gained at the Clinical and Research Institute of Urgent Pediatric Surgery and Traumatology.

They distinguish three basic periods in the early rehabilitation of the children with this condition, defined the main goals of rehabilitation and the role of each specialist in their achievement.
The results of the work provided the basis for the development of a stepwise approach for the extension of the rehabilitation measures and the solution of the tasks facing rehabilitation of the patients with vertebral cerebrospinal injuries.
The correction of nutritive losses was found to be a most important component of the early stage of the rehabilitation process preceding the full-scale rehabilitative treatment.
The role of various technical devices designed for the patients' re-education in functional motor activities, development and acquisition of the sustained self-service skills, enhancement of the patient's mobility, and improvement of his/her quality of life is discussed.
