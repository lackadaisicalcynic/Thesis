[Latex ligation in treatment of chronic hemorrhoids].
We analyzed the results of treatment of 432 patients with chronic hemorrhoids using different variants of latex ligation.
New technique including ligation of mucosa and submucosa of low-ampullar rectum providing ligation of hemorrhoidalvessels, lifting and recto-anal repair is developed and suggested.  This method is advisable to use in case of chronic internal hemorrhoids stages I and II.
The authors recommend simultaneous combined ligation of mucosa of low-ampullar rectum and internal hemorrhoids for stages III and IV. Different variants of latex ligation with external hemorrhoids excision were used in 103 patients.  Pointed variants of latex ligation preserve important advantages including mini-invasiveness, simplicity and wide availability, low cost.
Good remote results were obtained after these procedures in 87.3% of observations.
Suggested tactics extends use of latex ligation and increases its effectiveness in treatment of different stages and forms of chronic hemorrhoids.
