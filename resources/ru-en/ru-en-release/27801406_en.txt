[The influence of sinusoidal modulated currents on the fatty acid composition of plasma and blood erythrocytes in the patients presenting with chronic cholecystitis].
The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment with sinusoidal modulated currents on lipid metabolism in the patients presenting with chronic cholecystitis in the state of remission.
PATIENTS AND METHODS  The study included 25 patients with chronic non-calculosis cholecystitis in phase of remission and 20 healthy subjects (controls).
We studied the serum lipid spectrum as well as the fatty acid composition of plasma and blood erythrocytes before and after therapy with sinusoidal modulated currents applied to the right-sided hypochondrium region.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The treatment of the patients with chronic cholecystitis in remission with the use of sinusoidal modulated currents produced moderate lipid-modulatory and membranotropic effects mediated through the activation of the processes of lipid metabolism that may result in the depletion of the pool of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids.
CONCLUSION
The results of this study give evidence that it is advisable to treat the patients presenting with chronic cholecystitis by sinusoidal modulated currents in the combination with the oral intake of exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids.
