[Diagnostic value of optical coherence tomography for oral leukoplakia assessment].  The article presents a comparative analysis of the results of in vivo scanning of oral mucosa leukoplakia with optical coherence tomography (OCT) method and pathological studies in 15 patients (9 females and 6 males aged 27-82).
The study revealed specific OCT signs of leukoplakia: even disorder of tissue layering and less clear visualization of lamina propria.
OCT is an important stage in the differential diagnosis of leukoplakia of the oral mucosa and significantly complements the clinical and pathomorphological study.
