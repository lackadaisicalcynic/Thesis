It involved 92 patients including 23 ones presenting with bronchial asthma and 69 having no manifestations of asthma in their medical histories but suffering from dry cough that started after the beginning of pregnancy.
All the patients were given counseling by the otorhinolaryngology and pulmonology specialists.
The degree of endoscopic manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux was estimated based on a scoring scale.
The study revealed the correlation between cough duration and gestational age.
The signs of reflux-induced changes in the larynx were documented in 91% cases among the patients with bronchial asthma and in 97% cases in the pregnant women having no bronchial pathology in their medical histories.
The main cause behind the cough during pregnancy in women without bronchial pathology was sluggish bronchitis (7%), arising asthma (12%), gastroesophageal reflux (77%), and allergic rhinitis (4%).  This conclusion was confirmed by the results of therapy.
