AIM  To reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with advanced burns by developing a prophylactic algorithm.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study consisted of retrospective group of 488 patients with thermal burns grade II-III over 20% of body surface area and prospective group of 135 patients with a similar thermal trauma.
Standard clinical and laboratory examination was applied.  Instrumental survey included fibrogastroduodenoscopy, endoscopic pH-metry and invasive volumetric monitoring (PICCO plus).
Statistical processing was carried out with Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and IBM SPSS 20.0.
RESULTS  New algorithm significantly decreased incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (p<0.001) and mortality rate (p=0.006) in patients with advanced burns.
