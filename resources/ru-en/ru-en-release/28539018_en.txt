[Arterial stiffness in terms of thromboembolic complications in the elderly with atrial fibrillation].
To date, according to numerous national and international research, vascular stiffness has programmed the aging process significantly influences the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and total cardiovascular mortality in the elderly.
Attention should be paid to patients with cardiac arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF), as they are in a high risk of developing primary and recurrent thromboembolic events.
Taking into account the age factor and comorbidity disease among these patients is extremely high risk of death and disability.  It should be the consideration of factors that affect not only the development of the OP itself, but also its complications, to improve technologies to their correction.
In this respect, consideration vascular stiffness as one of the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of AF and a risk factor for acute thromboembolic complications, especially stroke, is extremely important.  Objective - discussion of studies on the study of arterial stiffness among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), as well as issues of the risk of thromboembolic complications in these patients.
