[Attitudes to elderly people in everyday life: Attitudes to elderly people in everyday life: conceptual outlines of explanation model].
The article deals with problems related to the third age in contemporary Russia.  It is based on empirical data obtained in unstructured students interviews (N=53) in Saratov and Moscow in 2007-2014.
The author shows that the lack of a respectful behavior regardless its reasons is often labeled as «disrespect».  As a result a «neutral attitude» is devoid of practical implementation.
In reality a «good attitude» to the third age is often unrealized because of the actions of older people themselves, as these actions are incompatible with respect practices.
These asymmetrical actions are embodied in intergenerational contacts and may take form of non-status behavior that disqualifies an elder actor as a potential object of respect, etc.
