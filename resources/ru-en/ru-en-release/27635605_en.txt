[Cognitive insight and dynamics of indicators of ultra-high risk for schizophrenia in young patients with non-psychotic forms of mental disorders].
AIM  To determine characteristics of cognitive insight and its relationship with the severity and dynamics of symptoms in patients with ultra-high risk for schizophrenia during treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 76 young patients with subpsychotic symptoms corresponding to criteria of ultra-high risk for psychosis and 55 healthy subjects.  Patients were examined using psychopathological analysis and a battery of psychological tests.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Cognitive insight, although not linked to objective indicators of ultra-high risk for schizophrenia, predicts a decline in both total score of SOPS, and in the Positive symptoms subscale during the treatment of patients with personality disorders.
In the groups with mood disorders and schizotypal disorder, cognitive insight reflects more anxiety and uncertainty related to patients' experience rather than the true conscious criticism.  In the group with schizotypal disorder, it is also closely related to the severity of subjective psychopathological symptoms.
