[The effect of cellex on cognitive and speech impairments in the acute stage of stroke].
OBJECTIVE
To study the effect of cellex on the recovery of cognitive and speech functions in the acute stage of stroke.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A multicenter comparative open clinical study of the efficacy and safety of cellex in treatment of patients with acute stroke was carried out in 6 clinical sites.
The study involved 180 patients, including 147 (81.7%) with ischemic stroke and 33 (18.3%) with hemorrhagic stroke.
Celex was introduced subcutaneously in dose 0.1 mg once a day during the first 10 days and from 21 to 27th days.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The rapid and complete recovery of neurological and cognitive functions was observed.  The more marked dynamics was seen in patients with greater initial stroke severity and with large hemisphere lesions.
