[Efficiency of paste and suspension with nano-hydroxyapatite on the sensitivity of teeth with gingival recession].  The purpose of our study was to assess the efficiency of toothpaste 'Intensive strengthening of supersensitive teeth with nano-GAP' INNOVA and the suspension 'Liquid Enamel' INNOVA on the sensitivity of teeth with gingival recession.
We examined 40 people aged 20-25 years.
Each group consisted of 20 people: 10 women, 10 men.
The first group (observations) used the paste and the suspension for 14 days, and the second group (comparisons) cleaned teeth only with a brush without a paste.
Schiff aerial test was performed to assess the rate of hypersensitivity.
As a result of the study, it was found that the combination of paste and liquid suspension with nano-hydroxyapatite for 14 days effectively reduced the hypersensitivity of the teeth with gingival recession that was shown by a statistically significant decrease in the Schiff index in the observation group.
Thus, this combination is the method of choice in the treatment of hyperesthesia and can be used as an alternative substitute therapy.
