[The potential of ectoprosthetics in rehabilitation of patients with orbital pathology].
AIM
rectification of indications and contraindications for ectoprosthetics and exploration of its potential as a modern rehabilitation modality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Here are summarized the results of 89 cases of facial reconstruction with prosthetic means in trauma patients and those who had had congenital or oncological pathology and in whom other methods of rehabilitation were unable to remedy the defect within the orbital region.
RESULTS  The indications and contraindications for facial prosthetics as well as the conditions, under which this type of medical and social rehabilitation can be carried out, were clarified.
The authors also explained the process of creating an epiprosthesis and how it should be attached to the orbit to have the maximum effect on the existing defects of both the bone and auxiliary apparatus (including eyelid soft tissues, eyelashes, etc.).  Because modern ectoprostheses are made of silicone and held in place with magnets, they provide an optimal cosmetic result, so that, regardless of patient's age, no rough defects can be detected on the affected side at a 2-m distance.
CONCLUSION
As the production technology develops, the cosmetic appearance of epiprostheses improves and their use broadens.
