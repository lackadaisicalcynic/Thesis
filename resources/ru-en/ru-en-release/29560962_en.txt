[The first episode of spontaneous pneumothorax (errors, hazards, complications)].
AIM
To analyze the errors and complications of surgical care in patients with the first episode of spontaneous pneumothorax at different hospitals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
From 2005 to 2015 three hundreds and seventeen patients with the first episode of spontaneous pneumothorax have been treated at the thoracic department of Volgograd State Medical University.
Patients were divided into 2 groups: 79 of them underwent thoracotomy while in 238 cases minimally invasive technologies were applied.  Faster preoperative management and earlier active surgical tactics were suggested.
There were 6 the most typical violations of surgical care in 42% of patients with the first episode of spontaneous pneumothorax.  Medical and diagnostic violations at regional centers and central district hospitals were the same, but there were differences in certain types of errors and their incidence.
Minimally invasive technologies do not significantly affect the number of violations of thoracic surgery principles.  Early procedures against the recurrence by using of thoracoscopic interventions reduce postoperative morbidity from 1.2 to 0.3% and mortality by 8.25 times.
