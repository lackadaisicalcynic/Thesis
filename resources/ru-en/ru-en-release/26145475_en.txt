[Dental treatment in children with dystrophic form of epidermolysis bullosa].
The aim of the study was to summarize the experience for providing oral health care in children with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) treated in Central Research Institute of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery in 2013-2014.
Seven EB patients (5 female and 2 male aged 5-17) with dystrophic form of EB were included in the study.  Oral status was recorded (oral hygiene, presence of enamel hypoplasia and intraoral soft tissue lesions).
Dental treatment provided included teeth extractions under conscious sedation (6 cases), teeth treatment (both conventional and ART methods) (5 cases) and preventive program (5 cases).
All 7 dystrophic EB patients presented with generalized enamel hypoplasia in both primary and permanent dentition.  In these patients one should consider using non-adhesive face dressings and careful suction pipe positioning as well as applying liniments on cotton rolls not to cause both intraoral and extraoral soft tissue lesions.
Sixteen milk teeth were extracted under conscious sedation, in 3 cases the procedure caused significant vestibular scarring.  Twelve teeth were treated mostly by ART method (n=1 0) as limited mouth opening made conventional treatment impossible.
Dental treatment in dystrophic EB is a real challenge for pediatric dentist.
This group of patients requires a special dental rehabilitation plan as they present with generalized enamel hypoplasia and have significant risk of intraoral lesions.
