[Cognitive disorders in the middle-aged population and cerebrovascular risk factors].
AIM  To study the frequency of subjective and objective cognitive disorders in the middle-aged population and their associations with main and additional cerebrovascular risk factors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The authors examined 169 men and 239 women aged 40-59 years.
Medical history study, blood tests, electrocardiography, brachiocephalic and common femoral arteries scan, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (MRI) were performed.
Luria and Munsterberg tests were done to assess cognitive dysfunction.
Affective disorders were assessed by the Hospital scale of anxiety and depression.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Absence of subjective (SCI) and/or objective (OCI) cognitive impairments was found in 26,5%; 10% had purely SCI, more than 35,7% of complaints were accompanied by deviations in neuropsychological test results (OCI+), over 25% had only OCI-.
The average age of patients with OCI+ was higher than in the control group.
In women, the frequency of SCI was twice as high and OCI less frequent as in men.
Absence of cognitive impairment and SCI were observed more frequently in individuals with higher education.
The prevalence of multiple white matter lesions (WML) in MRI was 36%.
Multiple WML and atherosclerosis of major arteries were more common in OCI+ group (47%).
Mild affective disorders were more frequent in the studied groups.
Anxiety disorders were more common than depressive ones.
The amount of patients with affective disorders was highest in OCI+.
Therefore, SCI is a common phenomenon among people aged 40-60 years.
The use of simple neuropsychological tests in screening examination allows to identify individuals who are most appropriate for active search for vascular risk factors.
Anxiety and depressive disorders cause a significant proportion of SCI among middle-aged people and are an important additional target for therapeutic measures.
