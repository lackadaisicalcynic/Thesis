[Current issues in pancreatic surgery].
AIM
To present own experience of pancreatic surgery and to analyze literature data for this issue.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We have analyzed work of abdominal surgery department over the last 5 years.
Moreover, MEDLINE and RSCI databases regarding surgical treatment of pancreatic diseases were assessed.  RESULTS
There were 456 pancreatectomies.  Postoperative complications arose in 176 (38.6%) patients, 11 patients died (2.4%).
According to world data, mortality after pancreatectomy reaches 10%.  Only creation of specialized centers is proven way to improve the outcomes.
CONCLUSION
Current medical assistance for pancreatic disease may be only achieved in specialized centers with large number of various pancreatic procedures.
The organization of such centers is required throughout the country and certain accreditation criteria should be developed for this purpose.
Targeted routing of patients to specialized pancreatology centers will be able to reduce incidence of diagnostic, tactical and technical errors.
