[Community acquired bacterial pneumonia and comorbidity in elderly patients].  We analyzed the clinical course of pneumonia in 67 elderly patients (39 females and 28 males, mean age 74,4Â±5,2 years) with chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Patients were divided into 2 groups: 1st group - patients with COPD, 2nd group - patients without COPD.  Pharmacological treatment was performed according to temperature, oxygen saturation, acute phase proteins and included ampicillin and sulbactam.
The normalization of temperature and oxygen saturation was observed on 3-4 day in patients of the 1st group and on 2 day in patients of the 2nd group, normalization of leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate - on 12-13 and 7-8 days, acute phase indicators (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen) on 7 and 5 days, correspondingly.
Positive dynamics of chest X-ray was observed on 13 day in patients of the 1st group (the second control and the replacement of antibiotic for levofloxacin) and on 8 day in patients of the 2nd group (the first control).
