[Simultaneous resection of the two tracheal fragments for cicatrical stenosis].  Treatment of multifocal and extended tracheal stenosis is associated with considerable difficulties in comparison with local lesions.
Resection with restoration of respiratory lumen by using of direct intertracheal anastomosis substantially entered into common clinical practice.  But these interventions in patients with two-level lesion are performed rarely.
Among 900 operated patients with cicatrical tracheal stenosis resection of two tracheal segments with forming of anastomoses was performed only in 5 patients.
We presented an experience of single-stage resections of different segments of respiratory tract for nonneoplastic cicatrical stenosis.  Indications and contraindications are defined.
Technical features of resection are discussed.  Our data show that such operations are possible and safe.
All patients recovered.  Their breath was completely restored.
Risk of postoperative complications after similar operations is not higher than after one-level resection.  But at present time these techniques may be used by specialists and institutions with serious experience in tracheal surgery.
