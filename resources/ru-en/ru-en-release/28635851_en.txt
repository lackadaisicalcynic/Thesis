[Modern views on myopic maculopathy].
Most of world's scientists consider the fast-growing incidence of myopia a problem of great social importance due to associated increase in complicated myopia that leads to disability among the working-age population.  This is a review on complicated myopia and myopic maculopathy that covers the history of research in this field, principles of classification, and etiological factors.
It also deals with choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which often follows, and its treatment options, including anti-VEGF therapy.  Possible complications of the latter are described as well.
Literature search was done using PubMed, eLIBRARY, and Scopus text databases.  A total of 61 sources, both Russian and foreign, were analyzed.
Current clinical knowledge of different types of myopic maculopathy is still insufficient and the gaps are likely to be filled using modern methods of detailed in vivo examination of both sclera and choroidea.  Anti-VEGF therapy has proved most effective in treating myopic maculopathy-associated neovascularization, however, a systematic approach to patient selection and management is yet needed.
