[Current approaches to treating of patients with multiple myeloma with renal failure: Questions and proofs].  Renal failure (RF) is detected in 20-30% of patients at the onset of multiple myeloma (MM), in 50% of patients during its progression.
The advent of new, highly effective agents has considerably expanded the possibilities of treatment in MM patients.
Unfortunately, patients with RF, especially those with severe RF, were not included in the majority of investigations.
The available data are based on the results of treatment in small groups of patients generally without the morphological identification of nephropathies, with varying severity of RF, which explains significant differences in renal response rates.
This review analyzes the results of the most important studies and gives recommendations for treatment in accordance with national and international standards.
