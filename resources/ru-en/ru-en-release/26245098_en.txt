[Specific features of suicides committed in a state of alcoholic intoxication].  The objective of the present work was to study the specific features of suicides committed in a state of alcoholic intoxication in 1985, 1995, and 2010 based on the materials collected by the Central Bureau of Forensic Medical Expertise, Ministry of Health of Republic Uzbekistan.
It was shown that the blood alcohol content in the subjects committing suicide tended to decrease during the aforementioned periods which does not confirm the opinion that limitations on alcohol consumption reduces the frequency of suicide attempts.
Most cases of completed suicide among the residents of Tashkent were recorded in a group of men of the medium and advanced age in the state of alcoholic intoxication.
The immediate cause of death in the majority of such cases was mechanical asphyxia due to hanging.
