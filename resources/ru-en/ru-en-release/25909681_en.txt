[The assessment of the clinical effectiveness of fenspiride for the treatment of acute obstruction of the Eustachian tube].  The objective of the present study was to estimate the clinical effectiveness of fenspiride used to correct the obstruction of the Eustachian tube in 80 patients presenting with acute tubootitis and exudative otitis media.
The algorithm of the examination included the evaluation of the severity of subjective clinical symptoms based on the relevant analog-visual scale, results of tonal audiometry, and tympanometry.  The control group was comprised of 34 patients treated with antibacterial preparations, topical decongestants, and transtubal administration of glucocorticoids.
The study group included 46 patients who received fenspiride at a dose of 80 mg thrice daily in addition to the above pharmacotherapy.  The severity of clinical symptoms in the patients treated with fenspiride decreased faster than in the control subjects.
The frequency analysis of dynamics of the air-bone gaps on the audiometric curves revealed the significantly more intensive recovery of the hearing function in the patients treated by basal pharmacotherapy in the combination with fenspiride.
Type A tympanograms predominated on day 7 after the onset of the conservative treatment with the use of fenspiride whereas type C tympanograms continued to predominate in the patients of the control group.
It is concluded that the introduction of fenspiride into combined therapy of acute tubootitis and exudative otitis media promotes the normalization of the ventilation and drainage functions and relieves the severity of subjective clinical symptoms.
