[The gravity field of the Earth: geophysical factor of gerontology (The Vorobeichikov effect)].  The results of investigations of the growth in vitro of Escherichia coli M-17, obtained in the processing of V. M. Vorobeichikov observational data during the movement of the scientific expedition ship «Akademik Fedorov» from St. Petersburg to Antarctica and back, in the period from 13.11.2002 on 26.05.2003 (48th Russian Antarctic expedition).
The findings based on the growth in vitro of Escherichia coli from changes in geographical location on a planetary scale, that doesnot eliminate the dependence of other species of microorganisms from the spatial position in the gravity field of the Earth.
It is established that the duration of the lag phase of Escherichia coli in the Equatorial zone close to its duration in the high-latitude zone and Antarctic, however, the duration of the lag phase at the equator and the Antarctic corresponds to the time of the lag phase at the time of the Central phase of the lunar Eclipse.
The conclusion about high sensitivity in vitro of Escherichia coli to the field of gravity of the Earth, and to syzigium events.
