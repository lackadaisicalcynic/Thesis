[Artificial illness as a result of non-medical use of anabolic androgenic steroids: A case report and a review of literature].
A 42-year-old female body builder who had used anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) for 18 years to build up muscle mass died from liver rupture.
The cause of the latter was multiple abscesses caused by Actinomyces, which developed in the presence of immunodeficiency.
The postmortem changes in different organs were due to hormonal imbalance.  The paper gives the data available in the literature pertaining to the analysis of the effects of AASs taken in supraphysiological doses on the body and their non-medical application.
