AIM  To study the types and early outcomes of combined interventions for locally advanced colorectal cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Since 2009 four hundreds and ninety eight patients underwent surgery in the Rostov Research Institute of Oncology for locally advanced colorectal cancer.
Most cases of surgical procedures on adjacent organs included resection of small intestine (23.69%), supravaginal hysterectomy (16.47%), resection of bladder (12.25%), total hysterectomy (11.45%).
RESULTS
Postoperative complications occurred in 178 (35.7%) patients.  Their incidence was significantly lower in case of laparoscopic approach (12.5%).
Functional-sparing interventions on bladder followed by its augmentation with enteric graft improves rehabilitation.
CONCLUSION
Laparoscopic approach and functional-sparing surgery improve the results of locally advanced colorectal cancer management.
