[Analysis of inpatient care for HIV-positive patients with malignant lymphomas and hepatitis over 5 years (2011-2015) at the A.S.Loginov Moscow Clinical Research Center, Moscow Healthcare Department].  The authors give their own data in the first Russian publication on 170 patients with lymphomas and hepatitis concurrent with HIV infection, on the distribution of therapy regimens by nosological entities and the number of deaths.
Conventional protocols and programs were used for diagnosis and treatment.
All the patients received highly active antiretroviral therapy.  Lymphoma was treated according to the conventional programs using rituximab in people without hepatitis B. Aggressive lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and plasmablastic lymphoma, were identified in most patients.
Hodgkin's lymphoma is the matter of a separate study; it differs in its pathogenesis from other lymphomas.
The rate of coinfection with hepatitis was high in the entire group of patients with lymphomas.
The major prognostic indicators included low CD4 T-cell counts (less than 50), stage IVB lymphoma, and hepatitis.
Complete remissions were achieved in 40% of patients.
Forty-one (24%) patients died.
