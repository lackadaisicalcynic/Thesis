[Anti-inflammatory effects of neurotrophic therapy (a pilot study)].
AIM  To study clinical effects of cerebrolysin and its impact on systemic inflammation markers and immunity in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Twenty patients with MCI were treated with cerebrolysin administered intravenously during 4 weeks.
Serum levels of immunoglobulins, inflammatory markers, neurotrophic factors were measured in dynamics in patients and controls using ELISA.
RESULTS
An effect of cerebrolysin was found in MCI patients including the older group (mean age 78Â±1.1 years).
An improvement was seen 6 and/or 22 weeks after treatment.
Four types of response to neurotrophic treatment (fast long-term, fast short-term, delayed long-term), without effect were determined, the longer duration of positive effect of cerebrolysin was shown.
There were differences in the indices of humoral immunity, clinical blood test results, cortisol and neurotrophin levels assessed before and after treatment between the patients with- and without positive effect of cerebrolysin.  CONCLUSION
The high clinical effect of neurotrophic therapy with cerebrolysin in MCI shows its anti-inflammatory and immunotropic action that suggests the impact of cerebrolysin on the pathogenesis of MCI.
