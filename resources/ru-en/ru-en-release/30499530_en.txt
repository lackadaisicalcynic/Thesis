[Corneal degenerations].
Degeneration is the process of change occurring in cells, their parts or intracellular matter that happens due to external factors affecting the life of an organism and results in gradual disruption of normal condition of the tissue or the organ, and possibly complete loss of its functionality.
Corneal degenerations may be caused by age-related physiological changes, associated with a certain systemic disease or local inflammations, or be the consequence of chronic toxic action of unhealthy environmental factors on the eye.  Unlike dystrophies, corneal degenerations cannot be inherited and do not onset early.
When corneal degenerations significantly affect visual acuity, the treatment should aim at alleviating the primary disease before inducing changes in the cornea.  The existence of such pathology is important to remember and timely differentiate from acute inflammatory processes of various etiology that require immediate treatment.
The right diagnosis is the key factor in choosing effective treatment strategy and thus achieving positive clinical results.
