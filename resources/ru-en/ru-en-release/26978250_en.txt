[Late-onset schizophrenia].
OBJECTIVE
To verify clinical observations by the epidemiological method.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The data of the full investigation of 1781 schizophrenia cases, including 403 patients in the age of 60 and older were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A number of characteristics inherent for this group were fully consistent with clinical observations.
These characteristics were connected with a few factors: probability to reach the old age for patients with young onset schizophrenia; probability to stay under psychiatric care for patients with long disease duration; characteristics of certain forms of schizophrenia and probability of the onset of some symptoms in elderly patients.
A combined effect of these factors resulted in the development of some common features of schizophrenia with late-onset, i.e. the rarity of malignant schizophrenia and high frequency of depressive disorders.
The author underlines the vagueness of the notion «late schizophrenia».
