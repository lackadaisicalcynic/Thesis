[Optimization of treatment of elderly patientswith diabetic foot syndrome and mediakaltsinozom arteries].  The objective of the research was to study the effectiveness of the drug Cytoflavin in the comprehensive treatment of mixed form diabetic foot syndrome with media calcification arteries in 75 elderly patients with type 2 diabetes.
