[Endoscopic endonasal surgery of paranasal sinus osteomas].  This article was designed to summarize the experience gained withendoscopic endonasal removal of paranasal sinus osteomas during the period from January 2013 till February 2016.
In addition a review of the relevant literature is presented encompassing the publicationsthat provide information about etiology, pathogenesis, clinical picture, diagnostics, and treatment of bone tumours.
The objective of the study was to enhance the effectiveness and safety of the surgical treatment of the patients presenting with paranasal sinus osteomas.
A total of 81 cases of paranasal sinus osteoma were documented in the patients admitted to I.P. Pavlov Saint-Peterburg First State Medical Universityduring the period from January 2013 till February 2016.
Forty nine of them were given the surgical endoscopic endonasal treatment with the removal of the neoplasm.
The remaining 32 patients were included in the group for the further dynamic follow up.
The authors report the data of morphological studies and the results of computed tomography performed in the pre- and postoperative periods with special reference to the potential for the use of the electromagnetic navigation station (an image-guidance system) that makes it possible to significantly reduce the risk of development of possible complications.
In addition, the findings suggestive of the progressive tumour growth in the group of the patients under dynamic observation are discussed.
