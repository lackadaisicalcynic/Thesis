[The results of a randomized open multicenter comparative study on the tolerability and safety of gilenya (fingolimod) in patients with remitting multiple sclerosis].  At the present time, disease modifying drugs (DMD) for treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis are used to reduce the risk of exacerbations and, consequently, slowing the progression of disability in accordance to treatment standards.
However, the application of the first line of this therapy is not always successful.  In these situations, patients receive second-line DMD.
Fingolimod is one of the second-line drugs in Russia.  To gain experience in using fingolimod in routine neurological practice, we have conducted a post-marketing research - GIMN.
