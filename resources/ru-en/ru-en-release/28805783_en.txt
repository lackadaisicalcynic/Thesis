[Effect of the Cytoflavin on the distal polyneuropathy severity in patients with diabetic foot syndrome with arteries mediacalcinosis].  The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cytoflavin in the complex treatment of patients with diabetic foot syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The research is based on the results of a comprehensive survey of 140 people with diabetic foot syndrome.
Depending on the treatment, all patients were divided into 2 groups.
The first group (n=35) received basic therapy.  The second group (n=35) in addition to basic therapy received cytoflavin 10 ml (+200 ml 0.9% NaCl) for 10 days, followed by switching to the tablet form of the drug 2 tablets twice a day for 1 month.
RESULTS
Analyzing the severity of polyneuropathy after treatment, we noted a more positive dynamic in patients who in addition to standard therapy received cytoflavin.
