[Efficacy and safety of noophen in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency].
AIM  To assess the efficacy and safety of noophen in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-three patients with cerebrovascular disease, who complain about persistent fatigue, were randomized into two groups.  Patients of the main group (n=33) received standard therapy and noophen, patients of the control group (n=20) received only standard therapy.
Treatment efficacy was assessed using MFI-20, HADS-A, LSEQ.  In addition, cognitive functioning was evaluated using Schulte test.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Treatment with noophen resulted in the marked decrease in the total intensity of fatigue measured with MFI-20.
The decrease in fatigue intensity by 30-50% was observed in 3/4 of patients of the main group.
Noophen reduced all components of fatigue syndrome, including a mental component, and improved motivation.  The reduction of the mental fatigue component was combined with the improvement of cognitive functioning assessed with Schulte test.
Therefore, the effect of noophen on motivation and mental fatigue component can promote cognitive training in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency.
