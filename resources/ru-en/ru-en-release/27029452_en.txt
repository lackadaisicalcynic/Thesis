[Assessing the impact of citicoline on the efficiency of rehabilitation measures in patients with ischemic stroke].
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the effect of citicoline on the efficacy of rehabilitation measures in patients with ischemic stroke (IS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Sixty patients were examined in the acute period of hemispheric IS.
All patients underwent routine comprehensive treatment.
The study group included 30 patients who received citicoline within the first 24 hours after IS onset.
The control group consisted of 30 patients who were not treated with citicoline.  The examination of patients included the assessment of neurological deficit, cognitive functions, P300 evoked potentials, head single photon emission computed tomography.
RESULTS
Six months after the onset of disease, there was a significant improvement in cognitive functions as assessed with the MMSE and Mo–°a scale, and P300 latency in the main group.
There was a trend towards the improvement in the activities of daily living (Barthel index) in patients of the main group compared to the control group.
SPECT results showed the improvement in cerebral perfusion in an affected hemisphere: in Broca's area, the rear sections of the upper and middle frontal gyrus, the parietal lobe (p <0,05).
CONCLUSION
Citicoline significantly improves cognitive function, which in turn has a positive effect on the efficacy of remediation and indirectly improves cerebral perfusion in patients with hemispheric IS.
