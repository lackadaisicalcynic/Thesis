[The long-term results of the application of the polypropylene mesh for the plastic correction of extensive laryngo-tracheostomas].
The objective of the present study was to estimate the long-term results of the closure of large laryngeal and tracheal stomas with the use of the polypropylene mesh.  The study included 33 adult patients presenting with extensive laryngeal and tracheal stomas.
A total of 34 surgical interventions were performed for alloplastic correction of these defects.  The complete closure of the tracheal and laryngeal defects with the incorporation of the prosthesis and restoration of respiration was achieved in 88.2% of the alloplastic procedures.
The long-term follow-up of the treated patients (median: 75 months) failed to reveal any signs of mesh rejection.  Moreover, none of the patients reported an appreciable feeling of discomfort at the site of mesh localization.
Thus, the results of the study indicate that the alloplastic correction of laryngeal and tracheal stomas with the implantation of the modern mesh prostheses from polypropylene monofilaments provides the safe and reliable alternative to autoplastic surgery.
Low rigidity of the modern prosthetic meshes ensures good immediate results of implant survival in the absence of long-term complications associated with the durable presence of the polypropylene mesh on the neck.
