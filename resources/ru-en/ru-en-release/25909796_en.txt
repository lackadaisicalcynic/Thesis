[Characteristics of autonomic-vascular status in patients with hemihypoplasia].
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate characteristics of autonomic-vascular status in patients with hemihypoplasia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  We examined 67 patients with hemihypoplasia, aged from 16 to 43 years.
The control group included 35 healthy people.  All patients underwent general neurological examination and detailed study of the autonomic nervous system using special probes and acupuncture tests.
Arterial ultrasound was used to evaluate the vascular system.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The syndrome of autonomic dystonia was identified in 63 (94%) patients.
Asympathicotonic variant of the syndrome, along with the decrease in autonomic reactivity and activity maintenance, were most frequent.
All diameter sizes of the lumen of the arteries of shortened limbs were within age-adjusted normal limits and did not exceed the values of physiological asymmetry.
Asymmetry of resistive index between paired arteries on the right and left sides did not exceed 3%.
