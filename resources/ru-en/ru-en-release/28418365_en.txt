AIM  To present early and remote surgical outcomes in patients with locally-advanced right-sided colonic cancer, invasion of pancreatic head and/or duodenal wall.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Early and remote surgical outcomes were analyzed in 27 patients who underwent gastropancreatoduodenectomy combined with right-sided hemicolectomy (ileotransversostomy extirpation) for locally-advanced right-sided colonic cancer.
RESULTS
Mean time of surgery was 300 (240-460) minutes, intraoperative blood loss - 2000 (500-7200) ml.
Postoperative complications were observed in 15 (55.6%) patients.
3 (11.1%) patients died in early postoperative period.
Overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival was 92.7%, 48% and 36,5% respectively.
Median was 33 months.
CONCLUSION
Advanced combined surgery for locally-advanced right-sided colonic cancer, invasion of pancreatic head and/or duodenal wall is associated with acceptable incidence of postoperative complications, early and long-term mortality.
