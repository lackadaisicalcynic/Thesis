[Clinical features of ischaemic stroke with cerebral venous insufficiency and its risk factors.]
Current research aimed to reveal clinical and neurological features of ischaemic stroke (IS) in patients suffering from cerebral venous insufficiency (CVI) combined with arterial hypertension (AH) and to identify its risk factors.  Examination data of 112 patients with IS
(aged 60-93 years old; mean age 72,1Â±2,6 years old, males - 39 (34,8%), females - 73 (65,2%), admitted at regional vascular center of St. Elizabeth City Hospital in Saint Petersburg, highlighted that cephalgic syndrome and vestibulocerebellar dysfunction occurred more frequently in stroke patients with CVI.  Also CVI was more commonly diagnosed in patients with vertebrobasilar stroke.
More severe disease course was registered in cardioembolic stroke, as compared to atherothrombotic stroke and patients without CVI.  Following risk factors of CVI development in patients with IS and AH were detected: constitutional venous insufficiency and also chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency due to arterial hypertension, cerebral atherosclerosis and cervical dorsopathy.
