[Complex application 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-succinate and vinpocetine in cerebrovascular disorder.]
Developing brain ischemia due to cerebral vascularization leads to disruption of brain metabolism.  Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion leads to irreversible brain damage and plays an important role in the development of some types of dementia.
Early use of antioxidants such as ethyl ether apovincamine acid (vinpocetine) and 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-succinate in the treatment of this pathology is seen as a real pathogenetically based method of correction of cerebral metabolism with cerebral vascular disorders, demonstrating the increase in cerebral blood flow and also neuroprotective effects.
Clinical studies and studies on biological models show that the main mechanisms of action of vinpocetine and 2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine-succinate, although have a similar focus, but implementing neuroprotective and nootropic effects via various links in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain damage.
