[Pychotherapy in patients with alcohol dependence and comorbid endogenous pathology].  AIM
To develop differential psychotherapeutic methods in the combined treatment of patients with alcohol dependence and comorbid paranoid schizophrenia.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors treated 154 patients using a specially designed psychotherapeutic program.  The sample was randomized into the experimental and control groups.
The experimental group received the psychotherapeutic program in contrast to the control group.  RESULTS
The psychotherapeutic program based on the treatment of alcohol-dependence symptoms and patterns of coping with mental disorder symptoms was effective for the patients.  Participation in the program allowed patients with alcohol dependence and comorbid schizophrenia to reduce manifestations of pathological craving for alcohol.
CONCLUSION  The appropriate psychopharmacotherapy of endogenous disorder symptoms is an essential condition for successful psychotherapy, especially at the beginning of the treatment.
