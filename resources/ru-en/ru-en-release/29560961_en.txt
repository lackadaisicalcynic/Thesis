AIM  To present own 10-year experience of abdominal aortic and great vessels aneurysms management.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  There were 369 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) for the period 1995-2016 at the Yaroslavl Regional Clinical Hospital.
25% of patients suffered from abdominal aortic and great vessels aneurysms.
Mean age was 70.3±7.5. There were 79 (86%) men and 13 (14%) women.
93 patients had 212 aneurysms of other sites besides AAA (from 1 to 6 aneurysms in each case).
63 (68%) patients have been treated and followed-up for the period from 1 to 10 years (mean 105±11.8 months).
RESULTS  1-, 5-, 8- and 10-year survival after AAA repair was 98%, 81%, 54% and 38% respectively.
CONCLUSION  The common complications of great vessels aneurysms are distal thrombosis and embolism (40%).
Ruptures of aneurysms are less common (13%).
These complications require active surgical tactics that allows to preserve the limbs in 85% of patients.
Progressive nature of disease in overwhelming numbers of patients (95%) with aneurysms enlargement and their occurrence in other sites requires regular lifelong clinical examination with mandatory ultrasound 2 times per year.
