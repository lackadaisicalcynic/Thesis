[Chronorehabilitation of the patients suffering from chronic cholecystitis with concomitant gallbladder dysfunction and opisthorchiasis].  The importance of the development of the effective rehabilitative measures for the patients suffering from chronic cholecystitis with concomitant gallbladder dysfunction and opisthorchiasis is beyond question.
The adequate methods for the rehabilitation of the patients after an intensive de-worming remain to be developed.  It is known that de-worming is not infrequently followed by the immediate amplification of the manifestations of the stagnation of bile in the gallbladder that become even more pronounced than before the de-worming procedure.
With the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the spa and health resort-based rehabilitation and prevention of the complications, it is recommended to make use of the modern therapeutic physical factors to be prescribed taking into consideration the characteristics of the biological rhythms in the functional activity of the biliary system in the individual patients.  The most effective rehabilitation methods for the treatment of the pathology in question include the application of the therapeutic physical factors known to produce the beneficial effect on the functional state of the biliary system and exert the normalizing influence on the structure of the biological rhythms of the functional activity of various organs and systems.
We used a range of approaches for the treatment of 123 patients with chronic cholecystitis and concomitant gallbladder dysfunction plus opisthorchiasis including extremely high-frequency electromagnetic irradiation (EHF therapy) in the combination with the oral intake of the choleretic herbal remedies followed by the transverse galvanization of the epigastric region with due regard for the phase of the rhythm of the functional activity of the gallbladder.
The results of such treatment gave evidence of the positive dynamics of all the studied indicators of the functional activity of the biliary system and the organism as a whole which suggests the highest therapeutic effect (87.9%) of the proposed treatment that was maintained during 6 to 12 months.
