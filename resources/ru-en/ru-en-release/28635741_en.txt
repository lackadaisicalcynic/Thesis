[A place of first-line drugs in treatment of multiple sclerosis].  A rapidly changing set of drugs for treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) leads to the necessity of searching for predictors of their efficacy.
Understanding of pathogenetic processes in MS and mechanisms of action of different drugs play an important role in the search for markers of potential responders.  The author analyses the presently accumulated information on the original drug copaxone (glatiramer acetate) including current concepts on the mechanism of action, long-term safety and efficacy.
Data on the frequency and significance of adverse effects during treatment with glatiramer acetate as well as on the influence of the drug on pregnancy, postpartum course of MS and development of the infant who received glatiramer acetate prenatally compared to other disease-modifying drugs are presented.
