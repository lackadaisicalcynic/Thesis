[On the possibilities for the identification of the signs of the thermal impact of a gunshot associated with the formation of the resulting wound].  The present review of the literature publications is focused on the methods designed for the identification of the signs of the thermal impact of a gunshot associated with the formation of the resulting wound inflicted by various firearm projectiles.
The historical and contemporary aspects of this topic are discussed with special reference to the immunodiagnostics as a new method extending the possibilities of forensic medical histology for the evaluation of the injuries to the soft tissues under the influence of thermal factors of the gunshot producing the firearm trauma.
