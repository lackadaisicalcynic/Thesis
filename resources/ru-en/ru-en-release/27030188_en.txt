[Seronegative celiac disease: A case report].  The paper describes a rare case of celiac disease in the absence of serum anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibodies.
A 51-year-old patient has been suffering from diarrheas for 20 years.
He has lost 15 kg gradually; weakness progressed; muscle cramps, leg edemas, and signs of dynamic pseudoobstruction appeared.
Morphological examination revealed small intestinal mucosal (SIM) villous atrophy (Marsh IIIC stage).  IgA anti-tTG and IgG anti-tTG antibodies were 0.086 and 0.178, respectively.
The patient was prescribed a gluten-free diet, water electrolyte solutions to correct metabolic disturbances, and prednisolone.
During a control examination after 6 months, the patient had no complaints and gained 22 kg, and the SIM villus height was increased.
The specific feature of the case is specific negative serological tests for celiac disease.
