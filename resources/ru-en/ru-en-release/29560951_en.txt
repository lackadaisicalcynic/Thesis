[Mental impairment in children with cerebral palsy: diagnosis and treatment].  The article covers the problems of diagnosis and treatment of mental impairment in children with cerebral palsy.
Mental disorders in cerebral palsy include cognitive impairment (disorders of perception, memory, attention, motor-visual coordination, intelligence and speech), border disorders (cerebral/asthenic, neurosis-like, psychopathic-like syndromes) and personality disorders (accentuation of character, mental infantilism).  Diagnosis of mental disorders in patients with cerebral palsy is a challenging task, due to various combinations of them with physical, speech and sensory disorders, which requires a differentiated approach.
Current trends in comprehensive system of rehabilitation, including medical and social, and psychological-pedagogical correction of cognitive, emotional and behavioral disorders, in cerebral palsy are reviewed.
Experience of using cortexin, which compensates for cognitive impairment and improves social adaptation, is discussed.
