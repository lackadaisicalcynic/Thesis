[Methods of augmentation of antidepressant therapy (on the model of complex therapy with the inclusion of actovegin) in gerontopsychiatric hospital].
AIM  Increasing the effectiveness of treatment of elderly depressed patients in the conditions of the gerontopsychiatric hospital by augmentation of actovegin to antidepressants of new generations (fluvoxamine, venlafaxine or agomelatine).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The efficacy of the therapy was compared in two groups of 21 patients aged 60 to 79 years with mild to moderate depression in ICD-10 receiving 8-week antidepressant mono- or combined therapy with actovegin.
The effectiveness criteria were changes in the mean total scores on the HAMD-17, HARS, CGI scales, as well as the proportion of respondents and the quality of getting out of depression.
Cognitive activity was assessed using MMSE, 10 word memory tests and drawing of clock.
RESULTS
It has been established that the use of complex antidepressants therapy with the inclusion of actovegin allows for a more rapid and pronounced therapeutic effect compared to monotherapy with antidepressants.
This is confirmed earlier (by the 4th week) and significant reduction of depressive and anxious symptoms (p<0.01), a greater number of responders and better quality of depressive outcomes by the end of treatment.
In patients with complex therapy, there was also a faster improvement in cognitive functioning.
CONCLUSION
Obtained results allow us to recommend the inclusion of actovegin in the antidepressant therapy regimen of elderly in-patients with the aim of achieving a faster and fuller therapeutic response and shortening hospitalization.
