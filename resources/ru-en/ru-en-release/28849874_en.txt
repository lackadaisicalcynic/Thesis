[On the discontinuity of the annuity curves in Drosophila melanogaster Canton-S strain.  IV. Effect of low temperature on the early imaginal stage].
We tested the effect of low temperature (18-20 Â°C) applied at the 13-22 days of imago life.
We detected prolongation of individual life span.
The effect is due to prolongation of the first phase of the annuity curve and thus to further delay of the next ones.
This may lead to delay of mature pathology and prolongation of maximal life span.  The effect is not dependent on sample size.
