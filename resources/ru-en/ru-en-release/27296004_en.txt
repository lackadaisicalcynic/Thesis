[Retrospective analysis of antenatal death of fetuses with a birth weight of less than 1000 g in the Voronezh Region].  AIM  to study the nosological structure of mortality among fetuses with a birth weight of less than 1000 g in the Voronezh region in the periods 2010-2011 and 2013-2014.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 267 autopsy protocols were analyzed in fetuses with a birth weight of less than 1000 g in the period 2010-2011 and 2013-2014.
RESULTS
Spontaneous abortion happened in 81 (30.3%) cases, artificial one did in 186 (69.7%).
The most common cause of stillbirth among extremely low weight fetuses was intrauterine asphyxia with a preponderance of antenatal asphyxia.
Antenatal intrauterine infection constituted a high proportion in the structure of antenatal losses.
In 2013-2014, the Voronezh Region showed a decline in the number of extremely low weight stillbirths due to induced pregnancy termination for congenital malformations after 21-22 weeks of pregnancy.
CONCLUSION
Considering the fact that antenatal fetal death is a traumatic event for both family and clinician, the causes of all stillbirths must be carefully analyzed.
