[Dimethyl fumarate (tecfidera) is the first line treatment choice in patients with remitting multiple sclerosis].
Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a new oral option for disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in patients with remitting multiple sclerosis as a first line treatment.
The results of international randomized studies comparing DMF with placebo and other DMTs are presented.
DMF is a DMT with promised efficacy and favorable safety profile that could be a treatment option for patients with suboptimal response for other first line DMTs and used as initial therapy for treatment-naive patients with unfavorable prognostic factors.
