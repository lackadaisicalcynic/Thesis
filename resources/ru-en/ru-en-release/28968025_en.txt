[The role of interactions of transposons with epigenetic factors in the aging process].  The review considers modern theories of aging mechanisms and data on epigenetic regulation of ontogenesis.
Transposons may be the material bases of the epigenetic control system, their movements affect the differentiation of cells and can cause genomic instability.  Control systems aimed at protecting against foreign DNA (splicing machine, microRNA processing) became the basis of regulatory networks of genomes underlying cell differentiation.
Transposon sequences are the basis for non-coding RNAs that suppress the expression of the transposons themselves and protein-coding genes at the posttranscriptional level, as well as by altering the activity of methyltransferases and modifying the histone modification.  Influence on transposons provides a basis for combating aging and age-associated pathologies.
In particular, it is possible to influence the change in the length of telomeres, the origin of which is associated with retroelements, by regulating the activity of transposons.
