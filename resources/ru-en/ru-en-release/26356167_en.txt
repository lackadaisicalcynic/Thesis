[International legal policy in the sphere of protection of the rights of people with mental disorders and Russian legislation].
Protection of human rights is a matter of priority for the international and Russian legislation.  The State is responsible for respect of corresponding principles.
Main documents on human rights were accepted by the United Nations and then by the European Council and WHO.
They were generalized to psychiatric patients as well.
