[The prevalence of the fungal flora in association with chronic inflammatory pathology of the larynx].  The present article was designed to analyze the prevalence and clinical features of laryngomycosis associated with chronic inflammatory diseases of the larynx.
We examined 430 patients suffering from chronic pharyngitis and found the fungal flora in 100 (23.2%) of them.
Diagnostics of the fungal infection was performed by the microscopic study of the stained preparations (including the Gram method, Romanovskiy-Giemsa and fluorescent microscopy).  The sowing on elective nutrient media was used.
The study revealed the presence of yeast fungi (Candida) in 98 patients (98%) and mold fungi (Aspergillus) in the remaining two (2%).
The hyperplastic form of fungal pharyngitis was diagnosed in 55% of the patients.
We have identified the following predisposing factors for fungal laryngitis: the gastroesophageal reflux disease in 56% of the patients, smoking in 50%, the long-term use of the removable dentures with the inadequate care for them in 30%, and the consistent use of inhaled corticosteroids in 27%.
Hyperglycemia was documented in 6% and the history of long-term treatment with antibiotics in in 10% of the patients.
The scheme for the combined antifungal therapy has been developed.  Its practical application allowed to achieve the eradication of the fungal flora and to improve the clinical course of chronic laryngitis in 75% of the patients.
