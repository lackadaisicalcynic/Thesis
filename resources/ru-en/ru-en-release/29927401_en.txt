[Indication of antiepileptic drugs to patients with epilepsy: results of the survey of neurologists].
AIM  To study knowledge and opinions of neurologists about priorities in using antiepileptic drugs (AEP).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Eighty-one neurologists from Moscow and surrounding regions were surveyed to identify the factors that influenced the choice of AEP.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Valproic acid was the most frequently used drug followed by levetiracetam and carbamazepine, which reflected the overall picture of PEP indication in patients with epilepsy in the Russian population.  Levetiracetam occupies a leading position as the starting drug for treatment of epilepsy; most often prescribed to women, patients with generalized seizures and idiopathic epilepsy.
It is the drug of choice as adjuvant remedies for Duo therapy.
