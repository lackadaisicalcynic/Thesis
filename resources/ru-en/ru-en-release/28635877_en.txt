[A neuropathic component of lumboischialgia: mechanisms of development and treatment approaches].
Low back pain (LBP) is accompanied by the development of pain syndrome that spreads into the leg in 25-57% of patients.  This is an important factor predicting the risk of transition of pain from acute to chronic and is an indirect indicator of disease severity.
It is often impossible to specify the primary mechanism facilitated pain irradiation in lumboischialgia because many structures can cause analogous symptoms.  Mechanisms of development of LBP are represented by nociceptive, neuropathic and psychogenic components.
Currently, the term 'neuropathic back pain' remains rather ambiguous.  Existing data suggest that the term 'neuropathic LBP is not confined to classic radiculopathy and is realized through several pathophysiological mechanisms.
Lumboischialgia is a clinical appearance of these mechanisms.  The authors present main mechanisms of the development of lumboischialgia, discuss clinical markers of neuropathic component of LBP, approaches to its diagnosis and treatment.
