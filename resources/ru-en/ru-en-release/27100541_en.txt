[Endoprosthetic repair with stent grafts in coronary artery restenosis].  Timely performed reconstructive operations on carotid arteries considerably decrease the incidence rate of ischaemic-type acute impairments of cerebral circulation.
Nevertheless, restenoses developing in the zone of reconstruction of carotid arteries level the positive result of the primary operation in remote terms of follow up.
In such cases it is more preferable to perform stenting of the damaged portions.
The article deals with cases of successful use of self-expandable stent grafts in restenoses of carotid arteries after carotid endarterectomy and operations of prosthetic repair of carotid arteries.
The analysis was carried out by international publications concerning this problem.
