[Modern diagnostics and treatment of posttraumatic hydrocephalus].  One of the frequent consequences of severe traumatic brain injury is posttraumatic hydrocephalus that not only hampers the processes of consciousness recovery, rehabilitation, and social adaptation of patients but also is the cause of disability.
Pathological processes underlying the clinical picture of posttraumatic hydrocephalus and the relationship between CSF circulation disorders and structural changes in the brain substance have not been adequately studied.  Of particular importance are patients in the chronic vegetative or minimally conscious state, recovery from which is blocked by posttraumatic hydrocephalus.
The question of reversibility of impaired consciousness depending on the disease duration has remained open.  High risks of purulent-inflammatory complications of shunting surgery are especially important in patients with chronic infection foci (tracheostomy, gastrostomy, epicystostomy, prolonged bladder catheterization, pressure ulcers, etc.), but their actual effect on the shunting outcomes has not been revealed.
Posttraumatic hydrocephalus remains a topical neurosurgical problem requiring clarification of its diagnostic criteria, differentiation from atrophy-related ventriculomegaly, and comprehensive development of pathogenetic and therapeutic aspects.
