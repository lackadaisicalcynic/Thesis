[Actual problems of the pathology of sepsis: 25 years in search of a consensus].  In search of a consensus the authors give current materials on the pathobiology of sepsis, which concerns the definitions, classification, etiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of the disease on the basis of their own experience and the data available in the literature.
The sepsis problem that is one of the most controversial and complex ones in pathobiology and medical practice has undergone a great very important 25-year stage of development to culminate in the adoption of clinical Sepsis-3 Consensus.
International experts have proposed a new definition of sepsis, with an emphasis on the life-threatening condition and the presence of organ dysfunction that can be regarded as an analogous to organ damage.  Systemic inflammatory response remains an essential sign of sepsis, but is not strictly specific.
Instead of its previous four forms of sepsis, two forms of the disease (sepsis proper and septic shock) have been identified.
The Consensus-proposed Sepsis-3 criteria for diagnosing sepsis continue to remain predominantly clinical laboratory ones, confirming the need for further clinicopathological and experimental morphological comparisons in order to achieve a complete understanding of the problem of sepsis between clinicians and pathologists.
