[The possibilities for the correction of the co-morbid anxiety and depressive disorders in the patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by the methods of climatic therapy].  The present study included 142 patients presenting with grade I-III chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated based at a spa and health resort (SHR) facility located on the southern coast of the Crimea.
The psycho-diagnostic testing was performed with the use of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HDRS) and the Ch.D. Spielberger - Yu.L. Khanin scale for reactive (situational) and personal anxiety.
The anxiety-depressive disorders were diagnosed in 59,2% of the patients; their intensity correlated with the severity of COPD.  The questionnaire study based at the Spilberger-Khanin made it possible to document the presence of moderate and severe anxiety in 68,3% of the patients.
It was shown that a course of the spa and health resort-based treatment produced beneficial effect on the psycho-functional status of the patients with COPD that was especially well apparent in those with the mild form of COPD.
