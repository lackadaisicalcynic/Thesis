[Tactics of reconstructive closure of basal defects after resection of midline tumors of the anterior skull base (a literature review)].  The purpose of this review is to analyze the techniques used to reconstruct midline defects in the anterior skull base after transcranial and endoscopic endonasal resection of skull base tumors.
We provide brief information on the technique for preparing various flaps, indications and contraindications, and advantages and disadvantages.
We analyze the international experience in the use of vascularized and non-vascularized flaps as well as the existing algorithms for reconstruction of complex defects of the midline structures of the skull base.
The literature data demonstrate the absence of a conventional tactics of reconstructive closure of the discussed defects.
To resolve this issue, a meta-analysis in combination with an original prospective study is required.
