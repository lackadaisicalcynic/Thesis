[Severe carotid stenosis: cerebral autoregulation in the ipsilateral region].
AIM  To study cerebral autoregulation (CA) in region of the stenotic carotid artery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 35 patients with critical stenosis of the carotid arteries, including 24 patients were asymptomatic and 11 patients with symptomatic course.
Blood flow velocity in middle cerebral arteries was monitored using Multi Dop X (DWL, Germany) with simultaneous noninvasive systemic blood pressure registration (CNAP, Austria).
CA was assessed by calculating the phase shift (PS) between spontaneous oscillations of blood flow velocity and blood pressure within the range of systemic Mayer waves (80-120 mHz).
RESULTS
In 18 patients, the CA indicators were in the normal range (PS 1.2±0.3 rad).
Seventeen patients, including asymptomatic as well as symptomatic types, had impaired CA (PS 0.2±0.2 rad and 0.3±0.2 rad, respectively).
Reconstructive surgery, irrespective of clinical manifestations, led to the significant increase in PS (p<0.001) in the early postoperative period (0.9±0.5 and 0.9±0.3 rad, respectively).
CONCLUSION
A significant variability in the cerebrovascular reserve capacity in symptomatic and asymptomatic types of carotid artery stenosis was found.
CA can be used in determining the indications for surgical treatment and evaluation of its effectiveness in patients with stenosis of carotid arteries.
