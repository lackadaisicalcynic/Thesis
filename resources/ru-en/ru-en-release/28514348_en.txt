[Dynamics of immunological features of oral liquid in children with chronic catarrhal gingivitis living on polluted territories with fluoride and iodine deficiency].
The aim of the study was to assess the state of oral liquid (OL) immunity in children with chronic catarrhal gingivitis (CCG) living in adverse environmental conditions. 120 children aged 7-15 residing in ecologically unfavorable areas of Lviv region were examined, while 75 children living in 'relatively clean' region were involved in the control group.
Chronic catarrhal gingivitis was diagnosed according to Danilevskiy classification (1994).
The level of cytokines in oral liquid of 7-years-old children living in ecologically polluted region (EPR), was (198.19±4.11)·106/l, which was 1.4 times more than in the conditionally clean region (CCR): (141.09±4.10)·106/l (p<0.01).
Analysis of cytokine profile in 7-years-old from EPR showed increased levels of IL-6 proinflammatory cytokines by 11.22% (13.78±0.38 pg/ml vs 12.39±0.50 pg/ml in controls, p<0.05) and the decrease of IL-4 anti-inflammatory cytokine by 26.9% (7.12±0.62 pg/ml vs 9.74±0.58 pg/ml, p<0.01).
In 12 years-old from EPR quantity of leukocytes in OL was 1.3 times higher than in controls ((246.81±4.16)·106/l vs (190.02±4.11)·106/l, p<0.01), the increase of the IL-6 content of 27.1% (p<0.01) and reduce of the IL-4 of 21.5% (p<0.05) compared to controls was also seen.
At the age of 15 further increase of leucocytes in children from EPR was revealed: (297.53±4.15)·106/l, which was 1.2 times higher than in controls (p<0.01).  Changes of cytokine profile in this age group were characterized by increased content of IL-6 of 26.41% (p<0.05) and IL-4 drop of 28.53% (p>0.05).
Thus the age-dependent trend for the increase of leukocytes count in OL and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 with the decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 is noted in children with CCG living in EPR.
