[MRI morphometry of neuroplastic changes in the brain after conservative treatment of traumatic brachial plexopathy].
AIM
To identify neuroplastic changes in the brain structures during treatment of traumatic axonotomy of the brachial plexus (the pathology of peripheral nervous system).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
MRI morphometry of white and grey matter was studied in 62 patients with traumatic axonotomy of the brachial plexus.
RESULTS
There were correlations between the thickness of sensorimotor cortex, morphometric parameters (volume, diffusion, fractional anisotropy) of subcortical formations (corticospinal tracts, the forceps minor), severity of neurological deficit and dynamics of clinical course depending on the therapeutic strategy.  CONCLUSION
The results expand the current view on central mechanisms of posttraumatic axon regeneration on the model of traumatic brachial plexopathy and establish a neuromodulative effect of neuromidin and noofen.  Some morphometric parameters may be used as the markers of reactive neuroplastic processes in the central nervous system.
