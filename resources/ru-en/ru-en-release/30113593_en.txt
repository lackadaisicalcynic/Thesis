[Critical ischemia of hip stump.
Incidence, clinical significance and diagnosis].
AIM  To study the incidence of hip stump ischemia, risk factors for 5-year survival after amputation, clinical features and diagnosis of this complication.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
1287 patients with peripheral artery disease followed by hip amputation were examined within 1997-2015.  50 of them had stump ischemia.
It was found that hip stump ischemia occurs in 5.2% of cases and significantly aggravates 5-year survival.  Transcutaneous oxygen tension less than 20 mm Hg is reliable hemodynamic criterion of ischemia.
