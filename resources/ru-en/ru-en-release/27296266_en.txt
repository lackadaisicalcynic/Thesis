[Incomplete thrombotic microangiopathy as a variant of hemolytic-uremic syndrome].  The described case illustrates difficulties in diagnosing atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS) in incomplete thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in the absence of thrombocytopenia, one of the signs of the classic triad of aHUS, which has resulted in the delayed verification of its diagnosis and in progressive kidney injury.
The paper discusses the need to carry out kidney biopsy and to include sHUS in both the presence of a complete set of symptoms of this disease and in the absence of one of them into a range of diagnostic search.
