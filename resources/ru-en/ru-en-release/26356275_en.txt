[Characteristics of neurological status in children with schizophrenia and schizotypal disorder].  AIM
To study characteristics of neurological status in children with schizophrenia and schizotypal disorder.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  A study included 80 children, aged from 5 to 10 years: 38 children were diagnosed with schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20.8хх3) and 42 with schizotypal disorder (F21).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Children of both groups had a wide spectrum of neurological symptoms, diffuseness of which indicated the disintegration of the multilevel system of motor analyzer.  No topical between-group differences were found whereas their intensity and frequency was not correlated to either the severity or a stage (exacerbation - remission) of disease.
The more marked was disease progression and severity of mental disorders, the greater was the amount and clearness of neurological disorders.  There was a predominance of disorders of motor regulation and integration, various extrapyramidal disturbances.
As a consequence, in absence of paresis and paralyses, there was not merely the alteration of the function per se but rather of its integrity, completeness, consistency with other mental acts that turned to be the neurologic equivalent of discordance and inconsistency of mental functions specific of schizophrenia.
These neurological symptoms may be considered as topic markers of the changes in the brain and dynamics of endogenous process.
Transitory and instable character of these symptoms, along with the deficits of extrapyramidal and cortical regulation outside of the process exacerbation, indicates the insufficiency of neurotransmitter mechanisms.
