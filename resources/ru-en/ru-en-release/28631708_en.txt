[New horizons in the use of biological agents during pregnancy in patients with rheumatic disease].  Pregnancy in the presence of rheumatic diseases (RD) and adequate therapy before planned conception, during gestation, and after delivery during lactation is challenging.
Advances in the treatment of RD are largely due to the clinical introduction of a new class of biological agents (BAs).
There are less than two decades of experience in using BAs in rheumatology and to date there are no unified standards and accepted rules governing their use during pregnancy.  According to the current requirements, information on a medicine should be given in three sections: 1) pregnancy; 2) lactation, and 3) use in men and women who are planning concept (the latter section has appeared for the first time).
The present article summarizes data on the possible use of BAs in patients with RD during pregnancy planning, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.
