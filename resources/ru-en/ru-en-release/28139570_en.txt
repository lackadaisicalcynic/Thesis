[Clinical and morphological characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and outcomes of surgical treatment of TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas].
Thyrotropinomas (TSH-secreting tumors) are a rare type of pituitary adenomas, which account for about 0.5-2.0% of all pituitary tumors.  The criterion of thyrotropinoma is visualization of the tumor in the presence of a normal or elevated level of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood and elevated concentrations of free T4 (fT4) and free T3 (fT3).
OBJECTIVE  To study the clinical, diagnostic, and morphological characteristics and treatment outcomes of TSH-secreting pituitary tumors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 21 patients aged from 15 to 67 years with pituitary adenoma and a normal or elevated blood TSH level combined with elevated fT4 and fT3 levels who were operated on at the Neurosurgical Institute in the period between 2002 and 2015.
Before surgery, in the early postoperative period, and 6 months after surgery, the patients were tested for levels of TSH, fT4, fT3, prolactin, cortisol, the luteinizing hormone (LH), the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol/testosterone, and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).
The thyroid status was evaluated using the following reference values: TSH, 0.4-4.0 mIU/L; fT4, 11.5-22.7 pmol/L; fT3, 3.5-6.5 pmol/L.
An immunohistochemical study of material was performed with antibodies to TSH, PRL, GH, ACTH, LH, FSH, and Ki-67 (MiB-1 clone); in 13 cases, we used tests with antibodies to somatostatin receptors type 2 and 5 and to D2 subtype dopamine receptors.
RESULTS
Thyrotropinomas were detected in patients aged from 15 to 67 years (median, 39 years), with an equal rate in males (48%) and females (52%).
Before admission to the Neurosurgical Institute, 11 (52%) patients were erroneously diagnosed with primary hyperthyroidism; based on the diagnosis, 7 of these patients underwent surgery on the thyroid gland and/or received thyrostatics (4 cases).
Hyperthyroidism symptoms were observed in 16 (76%) patients.
The blood level of TSH was 2.47-38.4 mIU/L (median, 6.56); fT4, 22.8-54.8 nmol/L (median, 36); fT3, 4.24-12.9 pmol/L (median, 9.66).
Tumors had the endosellar localization in 4 (19%) cases and the endo-extrasellar localization in 17 (91%) cases.
Total tumor resection was performed in 7 (33%) patients.
All these tumors had the endosellar and endo-suprasellar localization.
No total resection was performed in patients with infiltrative growth of adenoma (invading the skull base structures).
An immunohistochemical study of tumor resection specimens detected only TSH expression in 3 (14%) cases; 18 (86%) tumors were plurihormonal and secreted TSH and GH and/or PRL.
Of 13 tumors, expression of the type 2 dopamine receptor was detected in 9 (69%) cases; expression of somatostatin receptors type 5 and type 2 was found in 6 (46%) and 2 (15%) cases, respectively.
CONCLUSION
The criterion for total tumor resection was a postoperative decrease in the TSH level to 0.1 mIU/L or less.
Total resection was performed in 33% of patients with tumors of only the endosellar and endo-suprasellar localization.
In most cases, tumors were plurihormonal and secreted TSH and GH and/or PRL.
