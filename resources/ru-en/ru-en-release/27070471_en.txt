[Levels of proinflammatory cytokines and vascular endothelial growth factor in patients with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment].  OBJECTIVE  to evaluate the levels of cytokines (IFNα, IFNγ, IL-2, Il-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15), IL-1β receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its antagonist, the soluble form of receptor 1 (sVEGFR1) in the blood serum of patients with Alzheimer's disease, with early onset (ADEO) and late onset (ADLO), and in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Levels of interleukins, IL-1RA, VEGF and sVEGFR1 were measured in 20 patients with AD and 11 patients with MCI using ELISA.
These parameters were compared to the severity of cognitive impairment assessed by the performance on neurocognitive tests.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The levels of key cytokines (IL-8, TNFα, IL-12), VEGF and sVEGFR1 as well as anti-inflammatory proteins were different in patients with ADEO, ADLO and MCI.
These differences suggest the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of the disease that demands further research.
