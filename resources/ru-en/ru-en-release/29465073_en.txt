[Increasing the effectiveness of mandibular molars root resection surgery using retrograde endodontic revision].
The purpose of the present study was to increase the effectiveness of mandibular molars apical root resection surgery.  The study included 21 patients with diagnosis 'persistent apical periodontitis', 'root cyst', in 11 cases surgery was performed with less traumatic access with piezoelectric surgery system for separation of cortical bone block and subsequent reposition after resection and retrograde root filling.
The planning and procedure was described by 2 clinical cases.
Bone block reposition surgical procedure showed clinical effectiveness and was considered as a most acceptable technique of root resection.
