[Diagnostics and surgical tactics for papillary fibroelastomas of the heart].
AIM
To investigate clinical, diagnostic and surgical aspects of papillary fibroelastomas of the heart.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Clinical, diagnostic and surgical aspects of papillary fibroelastomas of the heart were analyzed in 12 patients.  RESULTS
Diagnosis was obtained using two-dimensional echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography or computed tomography.  Surgical treatment involved isolated excision of the tumor or combined with valve repair or replacement in case of valvular involvement.
Hospital mortality was absent.
CONCLUSION
Successful surgical treatment implies urgency, optimal exposition under hypothermic perfusion and pharmaco-cold cardioplegia, simple excision of the tumors and correction of comorbidities if it is necessary.
