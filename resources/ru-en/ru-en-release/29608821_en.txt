[Molecular markers of Alzheimer disease early diagnostic: investigation perspectives of peripheral tissues.]
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of elderly and old age people.  For intravital diagnosis of the expression of signaling molecules - AD markers, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral tissues are used: lymphocytes and blood platelets, buccal and olfactory epithelium, skin fibroblasts.
There are several changes in the production of hyper phosphorylated form of τ-protein, BACE1 and peptide Аβ42 in CSF in case of AD, but CSF taking may have a number of side effects.
Less traumatic taking of sampling tissues for the diagnosis of AD is in use of epithelium biopsy and blood portion.
An increase in the expression of the hyper phosphorylated form of τ-protein is shown in blood lymphocytes of AD patients.
An increase in the content of high molecular weight forms of phosphorylated t-protein and amyloid precursor protein-APP was also revealed in blood platelets of AD patients.
Changes in the amount of 2 miRNA families - miR-132 family and miR-134 family were revealed in blood cells 1-5 years before the manifestation of clinical signs of AD.
An increase in the concentration of bound calcium, synthesis of peptides Aβ40 and Aβ42, τ protein was observed in AD skin fibroblasts.
In the olfactory and buccal epithelium an increase in the expression of hyper phosphorylated form of τ-protein and Aβ peptide was detected in patients with AD.
Verification of AD markers in peripheral tissues for biopsy have the important significant for life diagnostics, prevention and and target AD treatment.
