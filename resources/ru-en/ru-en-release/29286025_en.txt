[The outcomes of different surgical procedures for thoracic injuries].  AIM
To assess the outcomes of video-assisted techniques compared with conventional procedures.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
596 victims with thoracic injuries were enrolled.
Video-assisted techniques were applied in 236 cases, conventional procedures - 360 patients.
Groups were standardized by the type of surgery.
Morbidity, hospital-stay and mortality according to Clavien-Dindo classification have been analyzed.
RESULTS
There was similar incidence of complications in both groups.  However, severe adverse events followed by redo surgery under general anesthesia occurred in 1.2% and 7.1% of cases respectively (p<0.05).
Hospital-stay was 11.3±3.6 and 14.5±5.3 days respectively (p<0.05).  Mortality was 0.58% vs. 1.08% respectively (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION
In victims with thoracic injuries and no need for urgent thoracotomy video-assisted techniques are preferable for diagnosis and treatment.
