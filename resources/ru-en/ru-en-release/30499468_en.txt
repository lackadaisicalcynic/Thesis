The present study included 280 thin bone slices of the cranial vault fragments obtained from 70 children at the age of 2-3 weeks or above that and the subjects aged up to 21 years.  The slices were prepared from the bone plates taken from the regions of the coronal (C2 - middle part), interparietal suture (S2 - apical and S3 - obelion parts), and occipital (L2 - middle part) sutures.
The thickness of the cortical and spongy substances was measured with the use of an Olympus BX 51 microscope and an OlympusSC 30 digital camera supported by the ImageScope computer software - program.  The Statistica 10 - package was used for the purpose of the step-by-step - step by step regression analysis to derive 20 multiple linear regression (MLR) equations.
On the whole, the results proved to be close to the calculated ones.
