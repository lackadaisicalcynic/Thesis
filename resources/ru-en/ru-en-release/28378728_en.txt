[Prevalence of external respiratory dysfunction in young people].
AIM  To investigate the prevalence of impaired external respiration function (ERF) in young Novosibirsk dwellers.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A cross-sectional population-based survey in one of the typical districts of Novosibirsk was conducted at the Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine in 2013-2015.
ERF was examined by spirometry in accordance with the guidelines.
The best indicators of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio were selected and three reproducible attempts were made to evaluate ERF.
Spirometry was carried out in 787 respondents (358 males and 429 females) for the entire period.
The results were interpreted according to the guidelines of the European Respiratory Society, the American Thoracic Society, and the Russian Respiratory Society.
RESULTS
The prevalence of a FEV1/FVC of <70% in the total sample was 10.3% (13.4% for men and 7.7% for women; p=0.009); a FEV1 of <80% was 13.9% (14.5% for men and 13.3% for women; p=0.617); a FVC of <80% was 7% (6.1% for men and 7.7% for women; p=0.397).
The obstructive type of ventilation disorders (FEV1/FVC <70%, FVC ≥80%) was recorded in 9.4% of the people, the restrictive type (FVC <80%, FEV1/FVC ≥70%) in 6.1%, and the mixed one (FEV1/FVC <70%, FVC <80%) in 0.9%; normal values (FEV1/FVC ≥70% and FVC ≥80%) were seen in 83.6%.
CONCLUSION
Spirometric screening of a young Novosibirsk population demonstrated the incidence of impaired ERF, which is comparable with Russian and foreign data.
