[Ocular thrombotic microangiopathy in atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (a clinical case study)].  The article presents a clinical observation of ocular thrombotic microangiopathy in atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome - a rare genetic disease characterized by systemic thrombosis caused by uncontrolled activation of alternative complement pathway.
A typical manifestation of this ocular lesion in this disease is bilateral Purtscher-like retinopathy.
Timely diagnostics of atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome, including ophthalmologic examination, determines the early start of a highly effective pathogenetic therapy with complement inhibitor eculizumab.
