[Model ontogenetic variability functional state of the organism in different modes of motor activity].  The analysis of the study results of remote training effect of physical training and sports in the age range including the later periods of human ontogenesis, from the point of oxidative stress theory.
To study the characteristics of developmental variability of the functional state of the organism, a comparative study of the functional state of the body at different modes of physical activity in different age stages of development was carried out: from sports veterans, remain actively locomotor activity after the termination of sports career; former athletes, leading a sedentary lifestyle; persons engaged in improving the forms of physical exercise; as well as persons who had not engaged in regular physical activity.
Subjects contingent was formed of men of various ages, as well as former athletes and coaches teams in cycling and team sports that require endurance predominant manifestation.  The results of the research allowed to develop a model that reflects the characteristics and mechanisms of developmental variability of the functional state of the organism under the influence of different modes of physical activity.
