[Right ventricular dilatation in patients with coronary heart disease without myocardial infarction: According to the data of the Coronary Angiography Surgery Registry].
AIM  To identify factors associated with right ventricular (RV) dilatation in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) without prior myocardial infarction (Ml).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Out of 16 839 patents from the Coronary Angiography Surgery Registry, the investigators selected patients with >75% stenosis in at least one coronary artery without acute or prior MI: 75 patients with echocardiographically detected RV dilatation and 1134 without RV dilatation.
RESULTS
Among the patients with RV dilatation, there were more men (92% versus 80.2%; p=0.01 2).
In this group, the mean body mass index (BMI) was higher (31.7±5.2 kg/m2 versus 30.1±4.7 kg/m2; p=0.01 9); there was more commonly higher NYHA functional class (FC) (III) chronic heart failure (CHF) (22.2% versus 12.5%; p=0.002), clinically relevant mitral regurgitation (29.4% versus 4.0%; all ps<0.001), and cardiac rhythm and conduction disturbances (45.5% versus 17.8%; p<0.001) in rarer severe FC (III-IV) exertional angina (30.3% versus 52.8%; p=0.007).
The groups were different as evidenced by coronarography and major blood biochemical indicators.
Decreased myocardial contractility (odds ratio (OR), 4.22; p=0.002), male sex (OR, 4.03;p=0.007), cardiac rhythm and conduction disturbances (OR, 2.98; p<0.001), clinically relevant mitral regurgitation (OR, 2.34; p=0.001); higher FC CHF (OR, 1.87; p=0.034), BMI (OR, 1.08; p=0.01 0), and lower FC exertional angina (OR, 0.42; p=0.001) demonstrated an independent relationship to RV dilatation, as evidenced by a multivariateanalysis.
CONCLUSION
In the patients with CHD without MI, RV dilatation is independently related to male sex, left ventricular functional characteristics, and higher BMI.
