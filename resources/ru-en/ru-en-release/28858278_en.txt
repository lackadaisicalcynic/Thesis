[Cephalometry efficacy in orthodontic treatment planning: correlations of cephalometric values and their changes in the course of treatment].  The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of cephalometry in planning of orthodontic patients with teeth crowding (TC) and Angle Class I molar relationship (MR).
Cephalometric values of 70 patients with TC and class I MR were analyzed before and after orthodontic treatment.
Cephalometric study of correlations proved to be more relevant than comparing with mean values.
In patients with TC and class I MR statistically significant were correlations with: facial profile (ÐN-A-B) and jaws relationship in anterio-posterior direction (ÐA-N-B); ÐN-A-B and type of maxillary growth (ÐPn-Mp, ÐB); ÐB and maxillary incisors inclination (Ðis-SpP); ÐPn-Mp and mandibular incisors inclination (Ðii-Mp).
These correlations depend on age, anomaly severity and orthodontic strategy.
Cephalometry proved to be effective tool for orthodontic treatment planning, prognosis and modelling.
