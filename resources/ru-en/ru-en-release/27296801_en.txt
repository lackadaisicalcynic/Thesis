AIM  To compare the phenomena of pathological fatigue and fatigability in patients after stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty-two patients were examined 6-24 months after stroke onset.
Fatigue and fatigability were assessed by Russian versions of the Fatigue Assessment Scale and the Dutch Exertional Fatigue Scale, respectively.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The severity of both fatigue and fatigability was related to the levels of anxiety and depression.
The degree of fatigability, but not fatigue, depended on the severity of cognitive and physical deficits.
Thus, fatigue and fatigability after stroke represent different phenomena.
