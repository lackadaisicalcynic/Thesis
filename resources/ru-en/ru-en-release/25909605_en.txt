[Blood supply topographic features in maxilla and mandible].  Topographic anatomical studies provide data on the characteristics of blood supply to maxilla and mandible.
It is established that maxilla is supplied by the large number of major arteries which are commonly anastomosed to each other.
Mandible intraosseous blood supply is by one major lower alveolar artery and a large number of small extraosseous arteries that supply blood to the bone, masticatory and facial muscles.
