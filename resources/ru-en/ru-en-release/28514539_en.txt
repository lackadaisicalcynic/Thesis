[The age changes of lymphoid organs structure: review of literature].
Numerous and often contradictory research results specify that the mechanism of increased susceptibility to diseases in old age has no satisfactory explanation so far.  Together with it in literature almost completely there are no comparative data on features of surgery and injury influence on a structure and functions of lymphoid organs at patients of different age groups.
However, lymph nodes are a marker of activity of inflammatory process in the region, on their changes it is possible to estimate precisely productivity of different medical actions, to predict development of many complications, and, thus, successfully to take actions for their prophylaxis.  All this is especially important and actual because of constant increase in average age, in life expectancy of human population and strengthening of surgical activity at patients of advanced and old age.
