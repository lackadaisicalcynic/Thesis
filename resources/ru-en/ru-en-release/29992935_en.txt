[Subjective, functional and microbiological parameters of the oral cavity in gastroesophageal reflux patients with acidic and subacidic refluctant].  The aim of the study was to compare dental and periodontal status, oral hygiene, salivation rate, functional parameters of saliva and oral microbiota composition in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with acidic and subacidic refluctant.
The study comprised 69 participants divided in 3 groups: 22 healthy volunteers (controls) and 2 main groups: 25 GERD patients with acidic (group 2) and 22 patients with subacidic refluctant (group 3).
Poor dental and periodontal condition was revealed in group 3 patients probably because of aggressive intestinal content reflux in the oral cavity resulting in higher PMA an saliva pH values, Escherichia coli species in oral microbiota and low buffer capacity of saliva.
The results show that GERD may be suspected due to oral manifestations thus promoting it's prompt treatment.
