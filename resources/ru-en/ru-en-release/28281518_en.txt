[Change in the ratio of blood saturated to unsaturated fatty acids is a universal marker of lipid metabolic disorder in patients with cholelithiasis].
AIM
To study the spectrum of serum fatty acids (SSFA) and the composition of blood lipids in cholelithiasis (CL) in various ethnic groups of East Siberia.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A clinical and epidemiological study was conducted, during which ultrasonography and oral cholecystography were used to examine 991 Khakases and 934 Europoids in Khakassia and 652 Evenks and 996 Europoids in Evenkia.
Biochemical tests were performed to determine serum lipids in 20% of the random sample.  Gas liquid chromatography was applied to investigate ASSFA in 220 patients in Khakassia and 157 people in Evenkia.
RESULTS  The manifestations of hyperlipidemia were detected in the Europoids with CL in Evenkia and Khakassia.
These changes were less pronounced in the Evenks with CL and absent in the Khakases with CL.  In all populations, the blood levels of saturated FAs and ratios of saturated to unsaturated FAs were considerably higher in the patients with CL than in the healthy individuals.
CONCLUSION
The higher levels of saturated FAs and the lower proportion of serum unsaturated FAs are a universal marker of lipid metabolic disturbances in patients with CL in genetically different populations.
