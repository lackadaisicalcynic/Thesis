[The specific features of the past medical history and etiology of pharyngeal abscess in the children].  The present study was undertaken for the purpose of elucidating the specific features of the past medical history and the etiological factors responsible for the development of tonsillogenic pharyngeal abscesses in the children.
We performed the retrospective analysis of the medical histories of 291 children presenting with this condition who had been admitted for the treatment to the ENT Department of the Morozovskzya City Children's Clinical Hospital during the period from January till December 2015.  The study has demonstrated the following most common shortcomings of the outpatient treatment of the patients suffering from chronic tonsillitis at the stage preceding formation of paratonsillar abscess: inadequate antibacterial therapy of acute chronic tonsillitis or its exacerbation and limited indications for tonsillectomy at the level of the outpatient treatment.
The leading role in the etiology of tonsillogenic pharyngeal abscesses in the children is played by beta-hemolytic Streptococcus of group A.  It is concluded that the medical history suggesting past paratonsillar abscess is the absolute indication for the subsequent tonsillectomy in the children of any age.
