[Pathophysiological aspects of neuro-endocrine regulation system in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome].  AIM
To reveal the changes in the pituitary-thyroid, pituitary-gonadal, adrenal components and in the prolactinergic system of neuroendocrine regulation in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 51 men aged 46-55 years.
The main group (BG) included 37 patients with severe OSAS.
The duration of clinical manifestations of OSAS was 10.5±1.5 years.  OSAS was verified on the basis of clinical and functional studies and polysomnographic monitoring in accordance with the AASM criteria (2014).
The control group (CG) consisted of 14 age-matched men without sleep-disordered breathing.
The body mass index in BG was 34.2±1.8 compared to 28.2±2.1 kg/m2 in CG.  Serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TTG), free thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), cortisol, prolactin, testosterone, luteonizing (LH) and follicle-stimulating (FSH) hormones were determined by the immunoradiological method using the standard DIA test system (Russia) and the analyzer 'Immunotest-800'.
RESULTS
Patients with severe OSAS had decreased concentration of free thyroxine (T4) and decreased activity of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (р<0.001), increased concentration of prolactin and cortisol (р<0.001), decreased concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone compared to the controls (р<0.001).
CONCLUSION
The changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal system are a manifestation of disturbances of the mechanisms of self-regulation and compensation that indicates the presence of maladaptive reactions of the neuroendocrine system.
