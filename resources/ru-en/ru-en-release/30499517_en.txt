To compare the chemical elemental composition of vitreous cavity content taken from cadaveric eyes compared to samples taken from the eyes with terminal stage refractory glaucoma with decompensated intraocular pressure (IOP).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The 1st group included 15 cadaveric eyes; the 2nd group included 15 eyes with refractory glaucoma in the terminal stage of the disease with decompensated IOP in patients with hypertension pain.  The vitreal content samples were taken in the course of antiglaucoma surgery aimed at preserving the eye as an organ and involving employment of drainage in the vitreous cavity.
The study of virtual contents was carried out on energy dispersive spectrometer Oxford X-Max 50 integrated into scanning electron microscope Zeiss EVO LS10.  RESULTS
Increased concentrations of Kalium and Phosphorus were detected in the vitreous content of cadaveric eyes compared with the vitreal content from the eyes with terminal glaucoma with decompensated IOP taken in vivo (K - 0.172/0.093; P - 0.045/0.025 mmol/L).  In the vitreous cavity in the eyes with end-stage glaucoma with decompensated IOP, the concentration of Nitrogen was higher in comparison with human cadaver eyes (2.030/1.424 mmol/L).
CONCLUSION  The increased concentrations of Kalium and Phosphorus in the vitreous content of cadaveric eyes is associated with postmortem autolytic processes and with the release of intracellular content in the destruction of cell membranes.
The increased Nitrogen concentration in the vitreal contents of the eyes with terminal stage glaucoma with decompensated IOP may be associated with the presence of osmotically active nitrogen-containing compounds in the eyes with increased IOP.
