[Transpalpebral craniotomy in skull base surgery].  The concept of minimally invasive neurosurgery has significantly evolved in recent years, which is associated with improvements in diagnostics, microneurosurgical techniques, anesthesiology, and intraoperative imaging.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We present the preliminary results of using transpalpebral craniotomy in surgery of supratentorial aneurysms and anterior cranial fossa tumors.
In the period between 2015 and 2107, we used this approach in surgical treatment of 30 aneurysms (10 aneurysms in the 'cold' period of hemorrhage and 20 unruptured aneurysms) and 10 anterior cranial fossa base tumors.
The approach included a superior eyelid incision and a fronto-orbital craniotomy.
We retrospectively evaluated outcomes, postoperative complications, and cosmetic results after these operations.
The mean follow-up period was 6 months.
RESULTS
There were no deaths, disabilities, or serious permanent approach-associated complications.
All patients had expected periorbital edema that was not considered as a complication.
CONCLUSION
Transpalpebral craniotomy is a safe and effective approach to anterior cranial fossa neoplasms and anterior circle of Willis aneurysms.
This approach avoids injury to the frontal and temporal muscles as well as to the facial and trigeminal nerve branches.
Patients assessed the postoperative cosmetic result as excellent.
