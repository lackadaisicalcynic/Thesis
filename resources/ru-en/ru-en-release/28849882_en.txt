[Cognitive-cytokine effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in the therapy of elderly patients with osteoarthritis].  The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of long-term non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) therapy on the dynamics of the severity of cognitive deficits and its association with changes in the level of cytokines in elderly patients with osteoarthritis (OA).
The authors performed a prospective observational study during 540±5,5 days, presented in two stages: phase I - the stage of active NSAID therapy; phase II - the stage of non-pharmacological correction of OA.
The first stage included 128 patients with OA from 65 to 75 years (average age 70±4,6 years, 10,2% of males and 89,8% female).
Patients from the main group were divided into four subgroups: patients of the 1st group (n=30) received the drug etoricoxib at a dose of 60 mg per day; patients of the 2nd group (n=32) - celecoxib at a dose of 200 mg daily, patients of the 3rd group (n=32) - nimesulide in dose of 100 mg per day; patients of the 4th group (n=34) - meloxicam at a dose of 7,5 mg per day.
The comparison group consisted of 40 patients with similar clinical and demographic characteristics of OA, not taking NSAIDs in the previous 6 months or during the study.
It was determined the pain and stiffness indexes by the WOMAC initially and evaluated the patient status at the MoCA scale and carried out laboratory diagnosis of contents in serum TGF-β1, IL-1β and IL-6 at all visits.
Statistically significant decrease in the level of cytokines was detected during the period of 1st-3rd visits for all patients in the groups receiving NSAID, also there was an increase in cognitive function on a scale of MoCA with a high degree of correlation in relation to the performance of cytokines to the end of the study.
The results of our research allow us to speak about possible influence on cognitive functions of NSAID therapy in elderly patients with OA in real clinical practice.
