[Characteristics of the expression of the transcription factor pSTAT3 in asthma].
AIM  To investigate the transcription factor pSTAT3 in overweight asthmatics on a model of peripheral blood mononuclear cells at baseline and during recombinant leptin modulation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A flow fluorometric assay was used according to the standard Bio-Plex protocol on a Bio-Plex immunoanalyzer (a flow fluorimeter) (Bio-Rad, USA) using xMAP technology at baseline and during modulation with recombinant leptin (Leptin, human, recombinant, expressed in a E. coli, Sigma, USA).
RESULTS  There was an obvious reduction in the level of the transcription factor pSTAT3 in patients with non-allergic asthma and an increase in that in patients with allergic asthma (AA).
Recombinant leptin modulation of pSTAT3 levels caused their paradoxical decrease in both overweight women younger than 45 years of age with AA and in those with non-allergic asthma.
CONCLUSION
The elevated level of the transcription factor pSTAT3 in AA is probably due to the overexpression of pSTAT3 in this group of patients.
The paradoxical decrease in pSTAT3 levels in overweight women under 45 years of age with AA, which is similar in the non-allergic asthma group, can be explained by the enhanced expression of negative SOCS3 regulators and by leptin resistance.
