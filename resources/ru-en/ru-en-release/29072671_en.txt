[The psychogenic hearing disorders in the children and adolescents].  The psychogenic loss of hearing is characterized by its impairment in the absence of anatomically and physiologically significant changes.
These disorders are poorly represented in the scientific literature in comparison with the organic lesions.
They are especially frequently overlooked in the children and adolescents.
The objective of the present review was to analyze the literature publications concerning this problem and to report two clinical observations of the pathology in question.
It is concluded that the clinically significant discrepancy between the audiological symptoms and the results obtained by the objective methods for hearing evaluation should be interpreted with great caution and raise the suspicion of the disease.
The diagnosis and the identification of the involved psychogenic factors are of utmost importance for the success of the treatment.
