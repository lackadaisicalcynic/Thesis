Prospective nonrandomized trial included patients with confirmed middle-/low rectum adenocarcinoma T1-4aN0-2M0 for the period November 2013 - September 2016.  We identified 20 out of 55 in TA-TME and 14 out of 54 patients in Lap-TME group as those of 'difficult' subgroup: male, BMI ≥25 кг/м2, previous chemoradiotherapy (CRT).
Time of surgery, blood loss, conversions rate, postoperative morbidity and length of hospital-stay were similar in both groups.  Hardware anastomoses were more frequent in TA-TME compared with LAP-TME group (78.9% vs. 50%, p=0.086).
Specimen quality was more favorable in TA-TME group: Grade I 10% in Ta-TME group vs. 28.6% in Lap-TME group; 'positive' CRM 5% vs. 14.3%, р=0.365. Within-group analysis did not reveal any differences between 'difficult' and 'typical' patients by surgical and pathomorphological characteristics in TA-TME group in contrast to Lap-TME group.  Median of follow-up was 24.6 (IR 10.6-40.2) and 23.8 (IR 12.1-39.9) months for TA-TME and Lap-TME groups, respectively.
Distant metastases were observed in 1 (1.8%) patient of Ta-TME and 2 (3.7%) patients of Lap-TME group.  Actuarial 3-years reccurence-free survival was 95.7% for Ta-TME and 93.9% for Lap-TME group, respectively (p=0.923).
TA-TME is advisable for 'difficult' patients.  Further multicenter randomized trials are necessary to specify the effectiveness of TA-TME in these patients.
