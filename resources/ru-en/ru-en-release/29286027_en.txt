[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: surgical treatment and targeted therapy].
AIM
To improve surgical and complex treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Our analysis included 97 GIST patients who were at Petrovsky Russian Research Center of Surgery and Moscow City Oncological Hospital #62 from January 2006 to September 2016.
RESULTS
Advisability of surgery for GIST patients was confirmed.
We have assessed surgical outcomes, defined the indications for adjuvant targeted therapy depending on GIST prognostic risk and additional factors for unfavorable course of disease.  CONCLUSION
It was concluded that surgical treatment is preferred for patients with resectable GISTs.  Adjuvant therapy is indicated in patients with high risk of progression if mutations indicating tumor sensitivity to the drugs are revealed.
Adjuvant targeted therapy is not indicated in patients with low and very low risk of progression.
