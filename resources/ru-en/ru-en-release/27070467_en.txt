[An open comparative observational study of the efficacy and safety of adaptol in anxiety-asthenic disorders in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia].
AIM
To assess the efficacy and safety of adaptol in anxiety-asthenic disorders in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Forty-nine patients with CCI and comorbid anxiety-asthenic disorder were randomized to standard treatment group (20 patients) and main group which consisted of 29 patients treated with adaptol (500 mg 2 times daily for 6 weeks) in addition to standard treatment.
The efficacy of treatment was assessed with HADS-A, HADS-D, FAS and SF-36.  Physical fatigue was evaluated using cycle ergometry test.
RESULTS
After 6 weeks, anxiety symptoms were stopped in the most of the patients of the main group (72.4%).
The threshold during cycle ergometry was higher in the patients of the main group compared to the comparison group (132.2 vs 114.0 VT, respectively) and the patients experienced less fatigue after the test.
Quality-of-life was improved by >10% in patients treated with adaptol and did not changed in the patients of the comparison group.
CONCLUSION
The addition of adaptol to standard treatment of patients with CCI allows to stop symptoms of anxiety, increase the tolerance to load and improve quality-of-life.
