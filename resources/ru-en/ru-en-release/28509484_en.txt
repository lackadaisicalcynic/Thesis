[Neuropsychological changes in cognitive function during the transition of the elderly in old].
The goal is to track changes in psychophysiological characteristics of cognitive functions associated with the transition of the elderly in the senile.
46 elderly people with a mean age of 70,5Â±1,7 years were surveyed.  After 7 years remaining 25 people were re-examined.
The method of time estimation of right - and left-brain reactions to various stimuli - visual, auditory, and cutaneous signals at rest and on the background of mental stress was applied.
In non-survived subjects in the initial survey the indicators of right- and left-brain reactions were delayed, further slowing in response to mental stress, while survivors' reactions of both hemispheres were very active, and the mental load caused activation of both hemispheres.
Re-examination of survivors conducted after 7 years has revealed they slow right- and left-brain reactions, while the mental load caused them already noticeable inhibition of the left hemisphere.  Identified in the study positive correlation of cognitive resource in old age with survival of the individual to the senile age should be regarded as a manifestation of the physiological relationship of integrative properties of the brain and organism viability in ontogenesis.
In this regard, the state of reactivity of the sensory areas of the brain can be considered as one of the indicators of the prognosis of survival of a person under a certain age.
