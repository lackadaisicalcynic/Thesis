[Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy].
Fuchs endothelial dystrophy is a severe disease characterized by slowly progressing bilateral asymmetric corneal edema usually seen in elderly patients.
The primary purpose of treatment is to minimize edema-related symptoms, such as ocular discomfort and visual acuity loss.
Conservative therapy is symptomatic and has a short-term positive effect that does not lead to full functional rehabilitation of the patient, while endothelial keratoplasty is pathogenetically oriented.  Intentional replacement of pathologically altered corneal layers has several advantages: preservation of corneal architectonics, rapid recovery of visual function, 'closed eye' surgery with corneal tunnel approach, and independence from expensive equipment.
However, principle indications and contraindications for various modifications of endothelial keratoplasty in the presence of comorbidity are still to be defined.
Further improvement of the methods and their broader implementation into clinical practice are the most pressing and promising issues of corneal transplantation.
