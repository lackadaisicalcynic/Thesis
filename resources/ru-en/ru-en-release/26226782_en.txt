[Intravascular leiomyomatosis].
Intravenous leiomyomatosis is a rare disease from a group of tumors with the indefinite grading potential.  The paper describes two cases of intravenous leiomyomatosis with its detailed morphological pattern, molecular genetic findings, and a brief literature review.
Losses of heterozygosity of microsatellite repeats thatwere located on chromosome 10 in 10q22.1 and common in uterine leiomyosarcomas were found in both cases.  Investigations of the morphological and biological characteristics of leimyomatosis are important to clarify the key molecular mechanisms underlying the development of this nosological entity and to determine etiopathogenetic relationships between intravenous leiomyomatosis and other uterine smooth muscle neoplasms.
