[Exogenous-organic disease of the brain is a paradoxical problem of clinical psychiatry].  The author considers an important issue of clinical psychiatry - mental or exogenous organic disorders.
An analysis of publications of 9 Russian psychiatric journals for the period 2011-2015 and program reports of the XV and XVI Russian psychiatric congresses shows that very small attention is given to this pathology.
According to the author's opinion, many aspects of this problem are unexplored or controversial.
Some different interpretations of the term 'exogenous organic' makes it uninformative.  There are not clear ideas about the structure of the clinical exogenous-organic disorders; their prevalence in different populations is not well studied; their combination with other mental illnesses requires further studies.
One of the causes of it is a lack of attention of specialists to this pathology because it has not been included in the ICD-10.  The solution of this problem is the creation of a national classification of mental disorders, which would include exogenous-organic mental disorders and, at the same time, would be integrated with the new version of ICD.
