[Variability and age-related features of the anatomy of the midline structures of the anterior skull base].  The article presents the literature data on the structural variability and age-related features of the midline anatomical structures of the anterior skull base (frontal sinus, ethmoid bone, anterior parasellar region, and medial orbital wall).
This is the area of surgical interests of neurosurgeons and rhinosurgeons.  The study objective is to analyze the literature data on the individual variability and age-related anatomy of these structures.
The work is illustrated with original images from the authors' personal archive.  The individual anatomical features of eloquent structures in the surgical area (structures within the surgical corridor, key anatomical landmarks, optic tract, internal carotid and ethmoidal arteries, etc.) should be considered in planning surgery in patients of all age groups because they can limit the view and the amount of safe manipulations or increase the risk of complications.
The presented data may be useful for neurosurgeons and otolaryngologists whose surgical interests are focused on the midline structures of the anterior skull base.
