[Energokorrektion of hemorrhagic stroke in the elderly].
The study included 102 elderly patients with hemorrhagic stroke of different size, location, and severity; the treatment was conservative.  The results of the study demonstrate the important pathogenetic significance of free radical processes for hemorrhagic stroke.
Severity of oxidative stress being a direct reflection of the energy deficiency correlates with the severity of the patients, with the volume of intracerebral hematoma, hyperglycemia, and determines the outcome.  Assignment Cytoflavin leads to the elimination of free radical imbalance, a more rapid recovery of the impaired consciousness and focal neurological deficiency with the improvement of the functional outcome of the disease, and disability also decreased.
