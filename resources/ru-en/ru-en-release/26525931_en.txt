[The influence of the immunity activation and suppression on the outcome of brain ischemia].  AIM
To explore the influence of the immunity activation and suppression on the outcome of brain ischemia in experimental animals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  Brain ischemia has been modulated by irreversible staged bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion.
Suppression of the immune system has been conducted by administration of cyclosporin A (5 mg/kg, per os).  Activation of the immune system has been conducted by administration of lipopolysaccharide (10 mkg/kg, i.p.).
RESULTS
Authors have established that in animals with immunosuppression there is an increase in the concentration of the neuron specific proteins in blood serum (NSE and MBP), mortality (by 20%) and severity of neurological deficit (by 33%).
Rats with immunosuppression have reduced general locomotor activity (by 44%), exploratory behavior in the Open Field Test (by 43%) and decrease in the motor activity in the Rotarod Test (by 19%) compared to the group of rats with brain ischemia and intact immune systems.
During the immunity activation after brain ischemia injury, the decrease in NSE and MBP levels, mortality (by 15%) and severity of neurological deficit (by 13%) as well as higher concentrations of neurotrophins BDNF and NGF and higher general locomotor activity of animals (by 34%) and physical endurance (by 55%) in the Open Field and Rotarod Tests, respectively, were observed.
CONCLUSION
Immunosupression negatively affected the outcome of brain ischemia.
