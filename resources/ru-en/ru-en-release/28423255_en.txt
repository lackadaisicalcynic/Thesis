[AGED CARDIOHEMODYNAMICS COMPLICATED BY STROKE].
A new method of arterial piezopulsometry allowed a 12-year study of the peculiarities of age-related changes in cardiac hemodynamic indices in an aged man after ischemic stroke.  The ob-tained results enable use of these indicators as prognostic criteria of an individual organism's re-sistance to acceleration factors of aging, as well as its resistance to the development of the cardi-ovascular pathology caused by the stroke.
Simultaneous dual registration of piezopulsograms al-lowed establishing a significant increase of the augmentation index of pulse pressure (AIxPP) and the velocity of the pulse wave of blood pressure propagation through the radial artery (Var) in a paralyzed right arm, compared to the left hand control (p < 0,05).  Range fluctuations in the relative values of this difference can serve as an objective indicator of the functional state of a paralyzed arm of a patient during rehabilitation treatment, and a sharp decrease of this difference and its subsequent stabilization can serve as an indicator of the beginning of recovery.
