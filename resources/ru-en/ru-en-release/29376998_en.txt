[Modern technologies and prospects of rehabilitation of patients after ischemic stroke].  Despite the great achievements in the field of neurorehabilitation, a significant proportion of patients after an ischemic stroke have persistent motor disturbances even after timely and adequately carried out restorative measures.
The article discusses the issues of neuroplasticity, modern diagnostic technologies for studying this phenomenon; prognostic factors for recovery deficit following stroke and determining the effectiveness of ongoing treatment.
The principles of neuroprotective therapy in ischemic stroke are considered, which is a pathogenetically justified direction at all stages of restorative treatment after cerebral circulation disorders.
One of the most studied original cytoprotectors, demonstrating safety, efficacy and good tolerability, is cytoflavin.
The results of numerous clinical trials have revealed a significant positive clinical and morphological dynamics when taking cytoflavin in patients after ischemic stroke.
