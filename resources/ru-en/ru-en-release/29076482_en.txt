[Palliative surgical correction of respiratory insufficiency in diffusive pulmonary emphysema].
AIM
To analyze early postoperative period in patients with diffuse pulmonary emphysema after palliative surgical correction of respiratory failure.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 196 patients who underwent bullectomy (n=111) and surgical reduction of pulmonary volume (n=85).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Overall morbidity and mortality were 40.8% and 12.2% respectively.
Among patients older than 60 years these values were significantly higher (58.0% and 22.6% respectively).  It was shown that age over 60 years is associated with high risk of complications and mortality after excision of large and giant bulls.
In patients <60 years morbidity is comparable after bullectomy and surgical reduction of pulmonary volume.
CONCLUSION
Selection of patients for palliative surgical correction of respiratory failure is generally corresponded to that for lung transplantation.  However, these methods should be considered complementary rather competing.
