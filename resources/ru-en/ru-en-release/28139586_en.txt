[Local and systemic immunity in patients with different course of generalized periodontitis].  The aim of the study was to assess local immunity of oral cavity and system immunity in patients with different course of generalized periodontitis.
Immunological parameters of oral mucosa, gingival liquid and blood were evaluated in 99 persons (31 with an intact periodontium, 32 patients with chronic course of periodontal disease and 36 patients with exacerbated periodontal disease).  Complex immunological assessment revealed that in periodontal disease the main changes were concentrated in the system of local oral immunity.
However, in the patients with exacerbated periodontal disease significant changes were also observed in humoral immunity and in the system of nonspecific protection.
Revealed immunological disbalance in patients with different course of periodontal disease requires differentiated immunotherapy.
