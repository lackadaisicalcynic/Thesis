[The use of hybrid CAD/CAM materials for rehabilitation of patients with dental hard tissues defects].  The article presents a clinical case demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid materials for rehabilitation of patients with dental hard tissues defects.
The patient presented with insufficient restoration of teeth 1.3, which was replaced by hybrid material Lava Ultimate fixed with adhesive protocol.  The use of hybrid material allowed minimally invasive preparation of dental hard tissues and perfect marginal fit, as well as prevented the attrition of antagonists.
The important issue in oral rehabilitation with hybrid materials is to respect adhesion protocol details.
