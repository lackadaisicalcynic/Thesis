[Metabolism of designer drugs.  Piperazine derivatives].
The present review is focused on the specific features of metabolism of designer drugs based on piperazine derivatives.  Selected physicochemical properties of the key metabolites of these compounds are described with special reference to their effect on the behavior of these drugs in the human organism..
Recommendations on the analysis of the markers and methods of sample preparation for the identification of the main psychoactive piperazine derivatives are proposed.
