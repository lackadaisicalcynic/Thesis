[Safety of mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: results of a 5-year follow-up].  AIM
To compare the safety of therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) who have received combination anti-inflammatory therapy using bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and standard therapy with 5-aminosalicylic acid, glucocorticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS  Unfavorable consequences were analyzed in 103 patients (56 with UC and 47 with CD) with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after MSC administration.
The findings were compared with data obtained in 208 patients with UC and CD on standard anti-inflammatory therapy.  All the patients were similar in demographic parameters, the duration of disease, the extent of intestinal injury, the nature of a course, the type and degree of disease.
The analyzed groups did not include patients who had received therapy with anti-TNF-Î± drugs.
The safety of therapy was evaluated from the presence of complications occurring during the follow-up.
RESULTS
By analyzing the unfavorable consequences in 103 patients with IBD and comparing them with treatment results in 208 patients with UC and CD on standard anti-inflammatory therapy, the authors revealed no differences in the development of acute posttransfusion reactions, infectious complications, exacerbations of chronic inflammatory diseases, severe infectious complications, malignant transformation, and fatal cases in patients with UC and CD, except for those with transient fever.
CONCLUSION
The results of this study demonstrate that the innovative method of cell therapy is clinically safe.
