Informing evidence-based policies for ageing and health in Ghana.  PROBLEM
Ghana's population is ageing.  In 2011, the Government of Ghana requested technical support from the World Health Organization (WHO) to help revise national policies on ageing and health.
APPROACH
We applied WHO's knowledge translation framework on ageing and health to assist evidence based policy-making in Ghana.  First, we defined priority problems and health system responses by performing a country assessment of epidemiologic data, policy review, site visits and interviews of key informants.
Second, we gathered evidence on effective health systems interventions in low- middle- and high-income countries.
Third, key stakeholders were engaged in a policy dialogue.  Fourth, policy briefs were developed and presented to the Ghana Health Services.
LOCAL SETTING  Ghana has a well-structured health system that can adapt to meet the health care needs of older people.
RELEVANT CHANGES
Six problems were selected as priorities, however after the policy dialogue, only five were agreed as priorities by the stakeholders.  The key stakeholders drafted evidence-based policy recommendations that were used to develop policy briefs.
The briefs were presented to the Ghana Health Service in 2014.
LESSONS LEARNT
The framework can be used to build local capacity on evidence-informed policy-making.
However, knowledge translation tools need further development to be used in low-income countries and in the field of ageing.
The terms and language of the tools need to be adapted to local contexts.
Evidence for health system interventions on ageing populations is very limited, particularly for low- and middle-income settings.
