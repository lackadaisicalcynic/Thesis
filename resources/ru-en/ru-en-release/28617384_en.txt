[A comparative study of the effects of mexidolum and mildronatum on the physical performance of experimental animals].
AIM  To evaluate the effects of mexidolum on physical performance using acute and subchronic administration in experimental animals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The investigation was carried out using 123 male white outbred mice.
The forced swim test was used to assess the effects of the drugs on the physical performance of mice.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A single intraperitoneal administration of 50 and 100 mg/kg mexidolum and subchronic intraperitoneal administration of 100 mg/kg mexidolum significantly enhances the physical performance of animals in the forced swim test.
Subchronic intraperitoneal administration of 100 mg/kg of the comparison drug mildronatum enhances the physical performance of animals, while intraperitoneal administration at a lower dose (50 mg/kg) has no effect.
The effect of mexidolum at a dose of 50 and 100 mg/kg is comparable with the effect of mildronatum in a dose of 100 mg/kg.
