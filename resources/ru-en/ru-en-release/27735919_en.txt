[Atrial fibrillation and prolonged nocturnal cardiac arrests in a patient with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.
Successful correction of disorders by CPAP therapy].  The case history of a 46-year-old patient with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was analyzed.
The examination revealed fourth-degree obesity, prior myocardial infarction, persistent atrial fibrillation with nocturnal asystoles lasting as long as 14.3 sec.  During selected drug therapy and regular application of secondary ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy) used to correct breathing problems, there was a reduction in the signs of circulatory deficiency, cessation of cardiac pauses, and recovery of sinus rhythm.
The therapeutic effect persisted during a 24-month follow-up.
