[Antiamnesic effects divaza and its component model β-amyloid amnesia].
AIM  On amnesia models induced by (icv) injection of β-amyloid fragment 25-35 peptide were evaluated antiamnestic actitity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was used of active antibody preparations (RA AT) to protein S100 (tenoten), to eNOS (impaza) and combinations (divaza) antiamnestic activity behavioral tests novel object conditioned response passive avoidance.
RESULTS  Under the influence of RA AT S100 observed recovery of violation of the β-amyloid short-term memory (1 hour after the initial presentation of objects), and RA AT eNOS were more effective when tested 24 hours later.
Combined medication completely compensate for the simulated deflection behavior of rats did not differ from the intact control.  The CRPA RA AT S100 had the greatest impact on the LP entry into the dark compartment, and RA AT eNOS influenced primarily on the emotional component of the reaction.
When using the integrated product tends to increase the LP entry into the dark compartment was observed in the absence of changes in the number of boluses.
Thus, tenoten had the greatest impact on cognitive impairment, impaza greater effect on the symptoms associated with surgery.
CONCLUSION
Combined preparation divaza rendered more effective action, leveling and amnesia neophobia, which confirms the need for further research and prospect release of active drugs in models of neurodegenerative disorders.
