[Subantral augmentation with porous titanium in experiment and clinic].  The article discusses the use of porous titanium for subantral augmentation.
Experimental study was conducted on 12 yearling rams.  Subantral augmentation using porous titanium was performed in 33 patients.
In the control group consisting of 14 patients calcium phosphates and bone collagen based agents ("Bio-Ðžss" and "Collost") were used.
In the main and control groups 46 and 32 implant were placed, respectively.  Pilot histological and clinical studies proved that the granules of porous titanium are biocompatible with bone tissue, provide the optimal surface microrelief, thus creating good conditions for adhesion, expansion and migration of osteoforming cells, have negligible kinetics of resorption, are porous to ensure effective neovascularization of de novo formed bone tissue.
Porous titanium is an effective alternative material for subantral bone augmentation for dental implantation and reconstructive operations on the maxillary sinus.
