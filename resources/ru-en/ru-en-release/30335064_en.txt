[Chronic diseases, precancer, and cancer of the lung, which are associated with pathology of the club cells of respiratory and terminal bronchioles].  The review of the literature deals with the participation of Clara cells now called club cells (CCs) of the epithelium in the respiratory and terminal bronchioles in the pathogenesis and morphogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, precancer, and cancer of the lung, which develop in the respiratory segments.
The review summarizes data on the histophysiology of CCs and their participation in the pathogenesis and morphogenesis of chronic interstitial lung diseases, pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive diseases, adenomatosis, and adenocarcinoma of the lung.  In this area, there is a bronchioloalveolar junction area (BAJA), one of the most important stem cell niches.
CCs are located in the BAJA; they are progenitor tissue stem cells and play an important role in the regeneration of the epithelium of the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli.
Pathology of CCs in the BAJA leads to the maintenance of chronic inflammation, to the destruction of the lung elastic frame, and to impaired epithelial regeneration, interstitial fibrosis, and adenomatosis.
In this case, decompensated inflammation, pathological regeneration, and fibrosis develop, which, along with the action of carcinogenic agents, can contribute to the accumulation of mutations and epigenetic rearrangements in the CCs, which subsequently results in atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the lung.
