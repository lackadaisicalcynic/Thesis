[Local immune and oxidative status in exacerbated chronic apical periodontitis].
The aim of the study was to define local immune and oxidative changes in patients with exacerbated chronic apical periodontitis.  These changes were assessed in saliva of 67 patients with the mean age of 31Â±2.5 before and after treatment.
The study revealed disturbances in cytokines and complement system balance and activation of lipids peroxidation.  Combination of Gepon or Vobenzim with Essentiale forte H and Kaskatol proved to be the most effective for correction of this imbalance.
