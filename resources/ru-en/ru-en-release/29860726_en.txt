[Disability of elderly people due to hypertensive disease in the Russian Federation.]  The article presents the results of the analysis of the epidemiology of primary disability of the adult population in the Russian Federation for 12 years (2005-2016).
During this period, 6.6 million elderly people (56,8% of the total number of people with disabilities) were recognized as invalids.
The leading cause of disability in the structure of primary disability among elderly people is 68,5%.  HD retains leading positions as the most important factor of disability of the population.
Negative tendencies of primary disability due to this socially significant pathology are associated with the demographic situation of population aging.
In the contingent of people with disabilities due to hypertension, the proportion of elderly disabled is 43,4%, while the proportion of disabled people of middle and young age is less - 29,1 and 27,4%, respectively.
Medical institutions should be prepared to work with a growing contingent of the elderly population, to increase the availability and quality of medical care for patients and people with disabilities due to HD, one of the most common and prognostically unfavorable pathologies that impose a limitation on vital activity.
