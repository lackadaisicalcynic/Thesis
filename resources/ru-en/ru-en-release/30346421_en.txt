[Experimental and clinical study of the effectiveness of polymeric membrane in surgical interventions on the oral mucosa].  In the experiment (on 15 individuals of the Shinshila rabbits) were conducted cytological research features of the healing the wound surface with the using polymeric membrane.
As a result of the clinical study, 100 patients with various pathologies were operated, resulting - an open wound on the mucosa of the palatine.
Two groups of patients were subsequently formed, in the first group the wound was closed with a polymeric membrane, in the second group the wound was healed by the open method.
A dynamic evaluation of the course of the postoperative period in both groups was carried out.
The features of the healing process were fixed on the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th days after the previous operation on a palatine.
It was found that the processes of wound healing under the membrane occur much more actively (granulation tissue is formed more quickly), there is a decrease in complications in the postoperative period and absence of bleeding from the postoperative wound.
The data received coincided with the results of the histological examination of smears-prints from the wound healing under the polymeric membrane and indicated the activation of the processes of epithelization.
