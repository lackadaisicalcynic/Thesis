[Treatment of wound defects in patients with neuroischemic form of diabetic foot syndrome].  AIM
Developing an algorithm of diagnosis and treatment of wound defects in patients with neuroischemic form of diabetic foot syndrome, study of the effectiveness of collagen implants in closing of wound defects.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The paper describes the diagnostic algorithm for patients with wound defects in neuroischemic form of DFS.  Wound cleansing from areas of necrosis, purulent-fibrinous plaque, biofilm of the wound was conducted on the day of hospitalization using hydrosurgery ultrasonic cavitation.
We propose the method of closing the wound defect with high-tech biomaterials based on type I collagen.
RESULTS
Implantation of type I collagen increased the relative rate of wound healing, reduced the amount of high amputation, and significantly reduced the average time of patients' stay in hospitals and their transfer to outpatient treatment.
CONCLUSIONS
1. Patients with neuroischemic form of diabetic foot syndrome should be timely and promptly pass the diagnostic phase.  2. Ultrasonic debridement is most effective method of wound preparation before its closure.
3. The use of bioplastic material Collost in patients with neuroischemic form of diabetic foot syndrome increases the rate of wound healing that leads to decrease the average patient's stay in hospital and reduce high amputations.
4. The average patient's stay in hospital reduced up to 20% that decreases the treatment costs of such category of patients.
