[Cerebral markers of endothelial dysfunction in chronic brain ischemia].  A review of the main markers of endothelial dysfunction in chronic cerebral ischemia is presented.
The quantitative changes in the level of endothelial dysfunction markers in chronic cerebral ischemia help to evaluate the efficacy of preventive and therapeutic pharmacological activities.
The results of clinical trials have demonstrated that the course use of divaz–∞ in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia leads to improvement of both clinical indicators and laboratory markers for normalization of cerebral ischemia and endothelial dysfunction.
