[An analysis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in different methods of coronary artery bypass].
AIM  To evaluate changes in cognitive functions in patients with coronary heart disease before and after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in a planned manner.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 192 patients divided into 3 groups: in group 1 patients (n=88) underwent standard CABG; in group 2 (n=61) different methods of CABG were used; a control group consisted of 43 people.  MMSE, FAB, Clock drawing test, Shultz tables, semantic verbal fluency, Wechsler adult intelligence scale were used for neurological testing.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction develops 3.2 times more often in patients after standard CABG.  Patients in the group with a differentiated approach show a trend towards the improvement of cognitive functions after surgery.
