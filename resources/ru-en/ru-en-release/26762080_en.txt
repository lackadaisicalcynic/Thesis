[Laser doppler flowmetry in esophagogastroplasty].
AIM
To present the results of laser Doppler flowmetry for assessment of gastric wall microcirculation.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study enrolled 22 patients who underwent esophagogastroplasty.  The changes in gastric microvasculature during tubular isoperistaltic transplant formation are described.
Significant markers of impaired circulation in stomach transplant 5-6 cm apart from right gastroepiploic artery termination were revealed.
RESULTS
Esophagogastrostomy at this level and more proximally increases the risk of anastomosis failure and cicatrical stenosis.
