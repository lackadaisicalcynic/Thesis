[Comorbid cognitive impairments in children with nocturnal enuresis and their treatment].
AIM  To study comorbid cognitive impairments in children with enuresis and assess the efficacy and safety of cerebrolysin in treatment of comorbid pathology.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Seventy patients, aged from 7 to 10 years, with the primary monosymtomatic form of enuresis were examined.
Enuresis was assessed by the mean number of 'wet' nights per week.  Neuropsychological tests were administered to measure short-term auditory-verbal and visual memory as well as SNAP-1V inattention and TOVA impulsivity.
Electroencephalography was used as well.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Children with enuresis performed lower on auditory-verbal and visual memory and attention tests compared to the patients of the control group.
Electroencephalography showed activation deficit and synchronized effects of thalamic structures.  The high efficacy of cerebrolysin (the improvement was seen in 80% of the patients) was demonstrated.
