AIM  To compare the results of robot-assisted and conventional techniques of pancreatoduodenectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It was performed the retrospective investigation of results of robot-assisted and conventional pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy in 7 and 7 patients respectively.
RESULTS
Duration of robot-assisted and conventional surgery was 460.71±119.77 and 288.57±62.2 minutes, volume of blood loss--414.28±285.36 and 400±163.30 ml respectively.
Postoperative complications after robot-assisted technique were classified as Grade I according to Clavien-Dindo classification.
Pancreatic fistulae were absent (ISGPF (2005)).
Lower duration of abdominal drainage and opioid analgesia were observed.  Also narcotic drugs were required by not all patients after robot-assisted surgery.
Histological study revealed the large number of excised lymphatic nodes.
CONCLUSION  Obvious advantage of robot-assisted operation was precision of great vessels and lymphatic nodes dissection, performing anastomoses.
Robot-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy corresponds to all requirements inherent to radical cancer surgery.
