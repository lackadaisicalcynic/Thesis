[Prevention and treatment of degenerative changes in ocular surface epithelium in patients with dry eye syndrome].  In current understanding of the pathogenesis of xerotic changes of the ocular surface in patients with dry eye syndrome (DES), great importance is given to hyperosmolarity of the tear film, inflammatory process and oxidative stress.
By now, no convincing data has been obtained on whether the oxidative stress is primary in relation to the inflammatory process in the ocular surface tissues, or if it is a complication.  Furthermore, in the complex treatment of patients with DES, antioxidant therapy has so far received little attention.
This problem can be solved with the 'artificial tears' preparation containing cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), which antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and clinical effectiveness has been convincingly proved in a number of experimental and clinical studies of recent years.
Improving the methods of vital diagnostics of xerosis of the ocular surface also enables detection of subclinical changes in epithelium of the cornea and conjunctiva, thus allowing timely prescription of metabolic therapy.  One of the promising directions of such treatment is the use of 5% dexpanthenol, which stimulates the processes of reparative regeneration and possesses an anti-inflammatory effect.
