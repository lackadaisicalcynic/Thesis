[Visual rehabilitation of patients with large post-traumatic defects of the anterior eye segment through iris-lens diaphragm implantation].
The diversity of methodological approaches and lack of pathogenetically reasonable tactics for patients with combined ocular injuries became the basis for the development and systematization of surgical rehabilitation stages of patients, in whom post-traumatic cataract is combined with post-traumatic aniridia and corneal scarring.
AIM
to construct a visual rehabilitation approach to patients with post-traumatic defects of the anterior eye segment following optical-reconstructive surgery that involved implantation of an iris-lens diaphragm (ILD).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We have analyzed 80 reconstructive cases with ILD implantation in patients with post-traumatic aniridia and corneal damage.
These patients constituted the first study group (Group 1).  We have also investigated 58 eyes with residual ametropy and stable visual function 1 year after ILD implantation before and after conducting a laser keratorefractive surgery.
These patients were assigned to the second study group (Group 2).
RESULTS
Rehabilitation approach to patients after anterior segment injuries that has been proposed allows to achieve high clinical and functional results and reduce the risk of intra- and postoperative complications.
CONCLUSION
The proposed approach to patients after optical-reconstructive surgery with iris-lens diaphragm implantation followed by keratorefractive surgery is an effective method of visual rehabilitation of anterior eye segment post-traumatic defects.
