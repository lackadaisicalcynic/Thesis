[An analysis of outcomes in respiratory therapy in patients with acute stroke].
AIM
To evaluate the effectiveness of mechanical ventilation in patients with stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A retrospective analysis of 520 patients with acute cerebrovascular diseases requiring mechanical lung ventilation was performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  In 44,6% of cases, the reason for transferring patients to mechanical ventilation was a worsening of neurological status; 69,1% of patients underwent prolonged respiratory support for a period of 3 days to 2 weeks.
54.2% of patients died.  Half of the surviving patients had a severe disability.
In patients of the older age group, the risk of an unfavorable outcome increased.
Mortality increased and the rehabilitation potential decreased with the increase of age and duration of respiratory care.
The results point to the need to create a unified concept for carrying out artificial ventilation of the lungs in patients of older age groups taking into account clinical and economic feasibility.
