[Treatment with the use of microcurrent lymphatic drainage physiotherapy during the postoperative period following rhinoplastic surgery].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the combined treatment of the patients who had undergone either primary or secondary rhinoplastic surgery with the use of photo- and magnetic therapy in comparison with the effectiveness of phototherapy in the combination with microcurrent therapy.
The patients were divided into four groups depending on the type of the surgical intervention and the mode of the combined physiotherapeutic treatment.
All the patients were given combined physiotherapeutic treatment in addition to the standard pharmacotherapy starting from the second day of the postoperative period.
The patients of groups 1 and 3 received phototherapy in the combination with magnetic therapy while those in groups 2 and 4 were treated by phototherapy in the combination with microcurrent lymphatic drainage physiotherapy.
It was shown that the different combinations of physiotherapeutic modalities during the postoperative period following primary «closed» rhinoplasty were not different significantly in terms of effectiveness.
After secondary «closed» rhinoplasty, the combination of phototherapy with the application of microcurrents looks more preferable.
It is concluded that microcurrent lymphdraining physiotherapy should be regarded as the priority component of the combined physiotherapeutic treatment during the postoperative period following secondary «closed» rhinoplasty.
