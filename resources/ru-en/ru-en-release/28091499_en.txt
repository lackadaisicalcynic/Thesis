[Migraine and depression: efficacy and safety of antidepressant therapy].
AIM  To study an influence of depression on the course of migraine and the efficacy of antidepressants in treatment of depression associated with migraine.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study consisted of 544 patients with migraine including 240 patients with depression.
Patients were examined at the first visit, after 6 months (visit 2) and one year (visit 3).
Then patients were interviewed by phone once a year (visits 5, 6, 7, 8), they were asked about a number of days with migraine.
Patients with depression were treated with antidepressants.
Results and —Åonclusion.
Six types of migraine course were determined: persistent episodic migraine, migraine remission, episodic migraine chronification, chronic migraine regress to episodic migraine, persistent chronic migraine, remitted or wavelike chronic migraine.
The presence of depression and skin allodynia predicted the development of persistent and remitted chronic migraine.
The effect of antidepressants of different groups was noted in treatment of patients with the combination of chronic migraine and depression.
The most pronounced effect was observed with tricyclic antidepressants, the smallest one when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were used.
