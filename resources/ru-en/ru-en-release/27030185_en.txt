[Evaluation of the efficiency of hepatoprotective monotherapy using succinic acid and methionine for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease at the stage of steatohepatitis].  AIM
To evaluate the efficiency of Remaxol monotherapy in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) at the stage of steatohepatitis (SH).  MATERIALS AND METHODS
The treatment of 156 patients with NAFLD at the stage of SH was analyzed.  A study group included 84 patients who had received intravenous Remaxol, 400 ml, dropwise at a rate of 40-60 drops per minute once daily in the morning for 10 days; a control group of 72 patients had been treated with the conventional scheme.
RESULTS
During the treatment, the study group showed a rapider relief of the manifestations of asthenovegetative and dyspeptic syndromes and a reduction in the magnitude of biochemical manifestations of cytolytic and cholestatic syndromes than did the control group.
CONCLUSION
Incorporation of Remaxol into the therapy regimen in patients with NAFLD at the stage of SH enhances the effectiveness of treatment.
