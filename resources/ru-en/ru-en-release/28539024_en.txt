[Echocardiographic indices of the right heart in patients with coronary artery disease in different age groups].
The aim of study was to examine echocardiographic indices of right heart chambers in patients with coronary artery disease in different age groups.  On 678 patients aged 38-85 years, who underwent echocardiography, are including with the use of spectral tissue Doppler.
Obtained 2 age groups: 1st - patients up to 60 years (n=282) and group 2nd - patients 60 years and older (n=396).
In the analysis the obtained results in patients with coronary heart disease in older age groups showed an increase in right ventricular wall thickness, systolic and average pressure in the pulmonary artery.
These changes were accompanied by deterioration in left ventricular diastolic function, while the systolic function of the left and right ventricle were independent of age.
Thus, the results can be recommended for assessment of right ventricular dysfunction in patients of older age groups.
