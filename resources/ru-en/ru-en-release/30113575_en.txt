[Evoked potentials in the rehabilitation of the patients after cochlear implantation].
The objective methods for the hearing examination of the patients after cochlear implantation provide an important tool for the speech processor fitting.  The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possibilities and the informative value of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) and electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR) combined recording technique.
For this reason, the comparison of the ECAP and EABR thresholds with comfortable levels of stimulation, obtained on the basis of subjective response and psychophysical testing of the patients with good results after cochlear implantation was performed.  19 patients with the CI experience from 1 to 5 years were included in our study.
The combined registration of ECAP and EABR can be used to evaluate the functional capacity of the central auditory pathways and for the fitting of the complicated patients, especially those in whom the registration proved impossible with the use of other objective techniques.
The ECAP and EABR threshold values were well correlated with the individual stimulation map profiles in the patients with the CI experience of less than two years (p<0.05).  The results obtained in the present study allow us to conclude that combined registration of ECAP and EABR could be used for the determination of stimulation comfort level parameters and individual stimulation map profiles, especially in combination with the minimum amount of psychoacoustic information received from the patient.
