OBJECTIVE  To evaluate an impact of low calorie diet therapy (LCDT) on cerebral hemodynamics, cognitive functions and quality-of-life of patients with arterial hypertension and chronic cerebral ischemia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The main group consisted of 22 patients, 16 women and 6 men (mean age 54.4±2.4 years), assigned to the diet.  The comparison group included 20 patients, 12 women and 8 men (mean age 55.6±1,0 years), who received standard antihypertensive treatment.
The results of Doppler ultrasound of cerebral arteries, cognitive functions and quality-of-life were assessed after 6 months of treatment.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A positive effect of LCDT on the cerebral hemodynamics, cognitive functions and quality-of-life indices maintained for 6 months.
The efficacy of LCDT was comparable to that of standard treatment in the comparison group.
