[Laparoscopic techniques in stage abdominal sanation for common pyoperitonitis].  An experience of treatment of 949 patients with common pyoperitonitis demonstrates that effectiveness of surgical tactics depend on stage of multiorgan dysfunction.
Laparoscopy decreases traumatism of additional surgery to diagnostic procedure in 68.1% of cases providing compensation of multiorgan dysfunction.  36.7% of patients with multiorgan dysfunction subindemnification need for stage lavage which is performed successfully by using of laparoscopy.
88.8% of patients in this group recovered.  It is necessary to remember that carboxy-peritoneum and its removal during laparoscopic lavage are associated with functional strain of cardiovascular and respiratory system in patients with peritonitis and multiorgan dysfunction decompensation.
High risk of irreversible function failure does not allow to implement potential of laparoscopic stage abdominal sanitation.
In this situation maximal mortality (91.9%) was observed.
