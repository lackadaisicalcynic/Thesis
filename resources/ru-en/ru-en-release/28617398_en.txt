[Ultrastructural changes of human dental hard tissues during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances].
The aim of the study was to evaluate ultrastructural changes of dental enamel after fixation of orthodontic appliances, initial influence of orthodontic forces and removal of braces.
Five intact permanent tooth extracted for orthodontic reasons were included in the experimental study.
Scanning probe microscopy was conducted in 4 random enamel points in each tooth (20 points overall) in semi-contact mode with standard 10 nm probes.
The study showed ultrastructural enamel changes such as nanofractures up to 1 mm along the braces locks.
The changes correlated with surface morphological features and teeth anatomy and may play an important role in dental decay and non-carious lesions occurring in the course of orthodontic treatment.
