[Beta-amyloidopathy as a manifestation of proteinopathy in age-related macular degeneration].
AIM
To investigate clinical and morphological features of amyloidogenesis in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is thought to be associated with proteinopathy, namely beta-amyloidopathy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 111 eyes with morphological signs of AMD as well as brain samples from 56 cadavers (aged at death 60 and over) were assessed with selective methods of amyloid detection.  RESULTS
Amyloid deposits were present in 39% of eyes with dry AMD and 80% of eyes with wet AMD.  Combined accumulation of amyloid (that is both in eyes and the brain) was found in 50.6% of cases.
CONCLUSION
The results allow to suggest that common etiopathogenetic and morphological features of AMD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are due to the same metabolic pathway of the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) responsible for aggregation of beta-amyloid (AÎ²), an abnormal fibrillar protein, and the development of beta-amyloidopathy in eyes and brains.
It has been demonstrated that beta-amyloidopathy is the keynote of both AMD and AD pathogenesis leading to cytotoxicity, neurodegeneration and pathological apoptosis.  Such views on the problem may promote the development of neuroprotective and ophthalmic geriatric medications effective at all stages of pathogenesis, including beta-amyloid formation and aggregation.
