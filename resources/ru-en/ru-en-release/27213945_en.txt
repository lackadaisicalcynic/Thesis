[Deformations of the vertebral column in the visually impaired schoolchildren presenting with complicated high myopia and the possibilities for its correction].  Complicated high myopia is one of the leading causes responsible for the disablement in the children associated with visual impairment especially when it is combined with other pathological conditions and abnormalities among which are disorders of the musculoskeletal system.
In the present study, we for the first time examined visually impaired schoolchildren (n=44) who suffered from high myopia complications making use of the computed optical topographer for the evaluation of the state of their vertebral column.
The control group consisted of 60 children attending a secondary school.
The study revealed various deformations of the musculoskeletal system including scoliosis, misalignment of the pelvis, kyphosis, hyperlordosis, torsion, platypodia, deformation of the lower extremities and the chest.  These deformations were more pronounced in the visually impaired schoolchildren in comparison with the children of the same age comprising the control group (p<0,05).
It is concluded that the assessment of the state of the vertebral column with the use of the apparatus yields an important information for the elaboration and application of a series of measures for the timely provision of medical assistance needed for the comprehensive rehabilitation of the visually impaired schoolchildren presenting with high myopia complications.
