[The interstitial disease of the lungs revealed by a histological study].  The authors report a case of the interstitial disease of the lungs revealed by a histological study that demonstrated intravital diagnostic faults in the patient in question.
Moreover, a postmortem diagnostic error occurred; namely, the macroscopic study of the thoracic organs had shown the 0.5 cm long linear rupture of the adhesion in the right lung root region that was considered to be the cause of hemothorax and anemia of the internal organs which supposedly resulted in the patient's death.
The definitive diagnosis of interstitial disease of the lungs was established based on the results of the histological study.
The histological picture of the process is illustrated.
