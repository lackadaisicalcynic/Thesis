[The course and the development of epilepsy in patients with typical variant of Rett syndrome and mutations].
AIM
Studying data of anamnesis, clinical state, electro-encephalographic, brain MRI in patients with Rett syndrome (МЕСР2).
MATERIAL AND METHODS  We studied 11 patients (female) from three to 23 years old with Rett syndrome and MeCP2 mutations.
Observation continued 10 years (2006-2015).
We analyzed the results of the neurological status, night sleep video-EEG monitoring, MRI.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Epilepsy diagnosed in six cases (54, 5%).
The overage age of debut of epileptic seizures was 3 years 9 months.  There are some types of seizures: generalized, myoclonic, myotonic, tonic, versive, focal motor, atypical absences.
Status epilepticus evolved in one patient.
Generalized seizures were 56, 25%, focal seizures - 43, 75%.
EEG changing marked in nine patients (81, 8%): slowdown back activity, episodes of periodic regional slowdown, regional epileptiform activity, and diffuse epileptiform activity like benign focal epileptiform discharges (BFED). five patients took antiepileptic drugs.  All of them had improved during treatment.
There were reducing of frequency of the seizures up 50% - 4 cases (80%). one patients with resistant epilepsy was taken combination of drugs (levetirecetam, topiromat, zonisamide, benzodiazepine) with stopping of seizures in the night sleep and decreasing of frequency of daytime seizures to 50%.  We believe there is very important of study epilepsy in patients with Rett syndrome and improvement of its treatment.
