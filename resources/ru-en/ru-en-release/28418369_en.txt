[Optimization of tissue reparation at treatment by Remaxol].
AIM
Studying influence of remaxol on reparative process of tissue reparation in a laparotomy wound.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
90 patients with the acute appendicitis complicated by local peritonitis in the early postoperative period are examined.
50 patients received traditional therapy.
Therapy of other 40 patients included Remaxol (intravenous introduction, daily within 5 days, of 400 ml).  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
It is established that Remaxol optimizes the course of reparative process in laparotomy wound that was confirmed with data of tenziomety and wound exudate cytological research.  Efficiency of a Remaxol is based on its capability to improve microcirculation, antiedematous action and its capability to reduce excessive intensity peroxide oxidation of membrane lipids, phospholipase activity and the phenomena of a hypoxia.
