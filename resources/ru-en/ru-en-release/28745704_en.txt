AIM  To study feasibility, effectiveness and safety of minimally invasive video-assisted parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism; to define the advantages and disadvantages of this technique compared with conventional open surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study includes the results of 33 minimally invasive video-assisted parathyroidectomies performed in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.
The control group included 36 patients who underwent conventional open surgery.
RESULTS
There were significantly increased time of surgery in the main group (41.2±12.7 min vs. 28.4±10.9 min, p<0.05), decreased need for postoperative analgesia (1,2±0.3 vs. 1.9±0.5 days, p<0.05) and significantly longer postoperative scar (1.8±0.2 vs. 6.2±0.5 cm, p<0.01).
Incidence of complications was similar in both groups (6.1% vs. 8.3%, p>0.05).
CONCLUSION
Minimally invasive video-assisted parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism is feasible, safe and effective intervention that improves early postoperative course and cosmetic outcomes.
