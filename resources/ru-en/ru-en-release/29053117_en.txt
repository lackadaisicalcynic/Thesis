[Autoaggressive characteristics of married couples, where husbands suffer from alcohol dependence].
AIM
To study autoaggressive characteristics of spouses in families of men with alcohol dependence.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  One hundred and twenty-five families, where a husband suffers from alcohol dependence, have been investigated.
Suicidal and non-suicidal patterns of autoaggressive behavior as well as their predictors have been studied.  The control group consisted of 62 families, where husbands were not alcohol dependent.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  It has been found that men with alcohol dependence tend to realize anivital programs through suicidal behavior and risky-victim behavioral modes.
A history of a suicidal attempt was revealed in 32% of alcohol dependent men, a suicide attempt over the last two years in 12% that was considerably higher compared to the control group.
The percentage in their wives was 16% and 7.2%, respectively.
The suicide attempts in wives were due to 'prosuicidal' complex of emotions with the sense of shame, guilt and hopelessness.
Gender differences in the ways of realization of suicidal attempts have been found.  This finding can be used in addiction treatment.
