[Comparative diagnostic value of various methods of intracavitary pressure measurement in abdominal compartment syndrome].
AIM
To investigate diagnostic value of various methods of biophysical somatic parameters (BSP) monitoring in peritonitis complicated by abdominal compartment syndrome.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
220 patients with advanced peritonitis complicated by compartment syndrome were enrolled.  Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic value of the measurement of intraabdominal, intraintestinal, intrathoracic pressure, paravulnar tissues tension depending on abdominal hypertension severity were determined.
RESULTS
BSP control including intraabdominal, intraintestinal, intrathoracic pressure and paravulnar tissues tension is effective for BPS disturbances diagnosis and abele to detect them significantly more often (p=0.037) compared with M. Cheatham's method alone.
