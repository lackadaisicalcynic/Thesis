[Spinal cord epidermoid cysts].  The article describes in detail a large modern clinical series of patients operated on for spinal cord epidermoid cysts.
AIM  the study aim was to comprehensively investigate the epidemiological and clinical peculiarities of spinal cord epidermoid cysts and evaluate immediate and long-term results of their surgical treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We describe and analyze surgical outcomes of 20 patients with spinal cord epidermoid cysts.
This sample was selected from 554 patients with intramedullary tumors and 365 patients with spinal dysraphism (aged from 2 months to 72 years) who were operated on by the first author in 2002-2017.
RESULTS
Our findings confirm a high efficacy and low risk of surgical treatment of patients diagnosed with spinal epidermoid cysts.
Severe complications of disease progression serve as indications for 'preventive' surgery even in asymptomatic cases.
Complete resection of the tumor capsule without deterioration of the functional surgical result is the main goal of surgical treatment.
Incomplete resection is associated with a high risk of recurrence.
The most thorough follow-up with annual MRI examination is necessary for the first 6 years after surgery.
