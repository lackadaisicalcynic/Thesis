[The reliable and plausible conclusions in the decisions of the forensic medical experts].  The authors characterize in brief the conclusions drawn by the forensic medical experts in the course of their professional activities with special reference to their reliability and plausibility.
The most common errors creeping into the conclusions are discussed together with the approaches to their prevention and/or correction.
This article continues a series of publications of the same authors concerning the main logical errors encountered in the conclusions of the forensic medical experts.  The results of a deeper analysis of such errors will be published elsewhere.
