[The application of the computer technologies for the mathematical simulation of the ethmoidal labyrinth].  The objective of the present work was to study the relationship between the dimensions of the ethmoidal labyrinth and the skull in the subjects differing in the nose shape by means of the factorial and correlation analysis with the application of the modern computer-assisted methods for the three-dimensional reconstruction of the skull.
We developed an original method for computed craniometry with the use the original program that made it possible to determine the standard intravital craniometrics characteristics of the human skull with a high degree of accuracy based on the results of analysis of 200 computed tomograms of the head.
It was shown that the length of the inferior turbinated bones and the posterior edge of the orbital plate is of special relevance for practically all parameters of the ethmoidal labyrinth.
Also, the width of the choanae positively relates to the height of the ethmoidal labyrinth.
