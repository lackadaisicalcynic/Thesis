[Extreme (complicated, ultra-high) refractive errors: terminological misconceptions!?]  The article reviews development mechanisms of different refractive errors accompanied by marked defocus of light rays reaching the retina.
Terminology used for such ametropias includes terms extreme, ultra-high and complicated.  Justification of their usage for primary ametropias, whose symptom complex is based on changes in axial eye length, is an ongoing discussion.
To comply with thesaurus definitions of 'diagnosis' and 'pathogenesis', to characterize refractive and anatomical-functional disorders in patients with primary ametropias it is proposed to use the terms 'hyperaxial and hypoaxial syndromes' with elaboration of specific symptoms instead of such expressions as extreme (ultra-high) myopia and hypermetropia.
