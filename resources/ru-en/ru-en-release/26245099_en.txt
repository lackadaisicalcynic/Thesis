[The influence of alcohol consumption on the chronological patterns of sudden cardiac death].  The objective of the present study was the retrospective analysis of the materials collected by the Republican Bureau of Forensic Medical Expertise, Ministry of Health and Social Development of Chuvash Republic, during the period from 1997 till 2002 for the elucidation of the chronological patterns of sudden cardiac death (SCD) associated with alcohol consumption depending on the sex and age of the victims, days of the week and months of the year as well as weather conditions.
It was shown that the peak of mortality among men and women taking no alcohol fell on Monday.  It was highest in May and decreased by February.
The alcohol consumption significantly changes the chronological patterns of mortality from cardiovascular pathology.  It was highest among the women abusing alcohol in August and October.
The study has demonstrated a weak negative correlation between the frequency of sudden cardiac death among non-consumers of alcohol and dew-point temperature among the persons having alcohol in blood.
