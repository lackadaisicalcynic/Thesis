[Magnesium deficiency and stress: Issues of their relationship, diagnostic tests, and approaches to therapy].
Magnesium plays an important role in the functions of the central nervous system.
It takes part in the regulation of the cell membrane, the transmembrane transport of calcium and sodium ions, and metabolic reactions that produce, accumulate, transfer, and utilize energy, free radicals, and their oxidation products.  The magnesium-containing substances include many sequestered antigens, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100, and neuron-specific enolase; magnesium may act as a neuroprotector that is able to modulate the regulation of blood-brain barrier permeability.
Investigations have demonstrated a relationship between the manifestations of stress reactions (anxiety, autonomic dysfunction, and maladjustment) and magnesium deficiency (MD).
Thus, mental and physical stresses cause an increase in magnesium elimination from the body.  MD in turn enhances a response to stress, by paradoxically aggravating its sequels.
Compensation for MD increases the ability of the nervous system to resist stress.  The valid diagnosis of MD present difficulties; namely, a blood magnesium concentration decrease below 0.8 mmol/l is evidence of MD; but the constant blood level of magnesium may be long maintained due to its release from the bone tissue depot.
So it is necessary to keep in mind the clinical manifestations of MD.
The authors have developed and tested a simple rapid MD assessment test and a stress resistance self-rating test.
The proposed tests will help to screen stress resistance and MD in outpatient settings.
