[The potential of the non-pharmacological methods for the rehabilitation and prophylaxis in the patients suffering from with atopic dermatitis].
This article was designed to discuss the therapeutic potential of various non-pharmacological and physiotherapeutic methods for the treatment and rehabilitation of the patients presenting with atopic dermatitis (AD) during the inter-recurrence period of the disease.
The particular emphasis is placed on the physical agents most frequently used for the purpose with special reference to the combined therapy of atopic dermatitis in the adults and children and to their rehabilitation in the inter-exacerbation periods.
In addition, the data on the prospects for the use of various medications intended for tissue- and organotherapy of the patients suffering from atopic dermatitis are presented.
The main traditional approaches to the management of the patients with atopic dermatitis under conditions of the spa and health resort facilities are considered based on the original experience of the authors including the application of various modes of ozone therapy regarded as a physiotherapeutic procedure for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in the children and adult patients, their rehabilitation, and the prevention of exacerbations of the pathological process based on the external and/or systemic application of the ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture.  The selected modalities of ozone therapy used to treat various clinical forms and stages of the atopic dermatitis differing in severity are described in detail.
The data on the influence of ozone therapy on a variety of pathogenetic factors of atopic dermatitis are presented as obtained by the investigations into dynamics of the characteristics of immunity, microcirculation, and the levels of free radical metabolites.
The results of the study give evidence of the high effectiveness of ozone therapy as a method of physiotherapeutic treatment both in the capacity of a component of combined therapy during the acute phase of atopic dermatitis and as the means of secondary (post-exposure) prophylaxis of the exacerbations and relapses of this condition based at the medical and preventive treatment facilities of various specialization.
