[Molecular mechanisms and pathogenetic treatment of mitochondrial optic neuropathies].  The article presents a review of literature on inherited optic neuropathies (ION), namely, Leber`s hereditary optic neuropathy and autosomal dominant optic neuropathy.
Their molecular genetic characteristics and pathogenetic mechanisms such as mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dynamics, and biogenesis are covered.
Prospects of ION treatment are described.
