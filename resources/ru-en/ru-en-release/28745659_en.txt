[Current approach and the role of laser photocoagulation in the treatment of retinal vein occlusions].  Despite the emergence of new approaches in the treatment of retinal vein thrombosis and post-thrombotic complications, namely, intravitreal pharmacotherapy and surgical treatment, laser photocoagulation continues to play a significant role in the management of patients with this pathology.
Although the method of laser photocoagulation has been used for quite a long time, different views exist on its indications and execution in specific clinical situations.
At that, not all opinions regarding the use of laser photocoagulation in thrombosis are based on convincing clinical studies.
The aim of this work was to summarize current literature data on the use of laser photocoagulation in the integrated treatment of retinal vein occlusions and, also, to show which aspects of the treatment of thromboses can be considered well-established and reasonable and which remain a subject of debate.
