Integrated prevention of mother-to-child transmission for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis and hepatitis B virus in China.
PROBLEM
China continues to face challenges in eliminating mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis and hepatitis B virus (HBV).
APPROACH
In 2010, a programme that integrated and standardized prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) efforts for HIV, syphilis and HBV was implemented in 1156 counties.  At participating antenatal care clinics, pregnant women were offered all three tests concurrently and free of charge.
Further interventions such as free treatment, prophylaxis and testing for mothers and their children were provided for HIV and syphilis.
LOCAL SETTING  China's national PMTCT HIV programme started in 2003, at which time there were no national programmes for perinatal syphilis and HBV.
In 2009, the rate of maternal-to-child transmission of HIV was 8.1% (57/702).  Reported congenital syphilis was 60.8 per 100,000 live births.
HBV infection was 7.2% of the overall population infected.
RELEVANT CHANGES  Between 2010 and 2013 the number of pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics with integrated PMTCT services increased from 5.5 million to 13.1 million.
In 2013, 12.7 million pregnant women were tested for HIV, 12.6 million for syphilis and 12.7 million for HBV.
Mother-to-child transmission of HIV fell to 6.7% in 2013.
Data on syphilis transmission are not yet available.
LESSONS LEARNT
Integrated PMTCT services proved to be feasible and effective, and they are now part of the routine maternal and child health services provided to infected women.
The services are provided through a collaboration between maternal and child health clinics, the national and local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and general hospitals.
