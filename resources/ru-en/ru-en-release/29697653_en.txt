[The heredity and the curvature of the nasal septum in the children].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the role of genetic and environmental factors in the development of the curvature of the nasal septum in the children by means of the twin method.
A total of 171 twins were examined during the study.
They included 27 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins and 1 triplet.  There were 87 boys and 84 girls.
All of them were distributed by age as follows: group 1 (3-7 years) - 97 children, group II (8-11 years) - 34 children, group III (12-15 years) - 40 adolescents.
Taken together, the members of these groups accounted for 56.7%, 19.9%, and 23.4% of the participants of the study respectively.  The prevalence of the nasal septum curvature among the children born after multiple pregnancies (MZ and dizygotic (DZ) twins) with such ENT pathology as the curvature of the nasal septum was estimated at 68.5% and 47.6% respectively.
The intraparallel correlation analysis showed that both twins of a MZ pair presented with the curvature of the nasal septum in 12 (30.7%) pairs.
The study has demonstrated the statistically significant difference in the frequency of concurrence of the nasal septum curvature between MZ and DZ twins (p=0.005).
It is concluded that the results of the study give evidence that heredity and genetic factors greatly contribute to the formation of the curvature of the nasal septum in the children.
