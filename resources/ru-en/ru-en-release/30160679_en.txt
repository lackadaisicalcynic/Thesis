[Additional possible mechanisms of the action of ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis on example of a case-report].
Anti-B-cells products, including the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab, are widely coming to multiple sclerosis (MS) therapy.
Its clinical-MRI efficacy in MS with relapses as well in primary progressive MS (PPMS) was proved by three phase III clinical studies.
One example of the use of ocrelizumab use in aggressive MS showed the possibility of action on the leptomeningeal folliculi, seen at contract-enhancing MRI images.
