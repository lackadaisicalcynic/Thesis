[The use of citoflavin in neonatology and pediatrics as a factor improving therapeutic efficacy in patients with central nervous system lesions of various etiology].
Possibilities of increasing the therapeutic efficacy in patients with perinatal central nervous system (CNS) lesions of hypoxic-ischemic and infectious etiology are considered.
Some questions of pathophysiological features of hypoxic-ischemic CNS disorders in newborns and their connection with further cascade of pathological changes in organs and systems are highlighted.
In this light, the authors substantiate the need for adequate and effective neuro- (cerebro-) protection by the timely antioxidant energy correction and antihypoxic therapy with cytoflavin.  The use of cytoflavin is justified in terms of efficacy and safety and can be recommended for use in practical health care in neonatology and pediatrics.
