[The relationship between the parameters of cognitive potential P300 and emotional/affective state of patients with chronic pain].
OBJECTIVE
To study emotional state and parameters of cognitive evoked potentials (P300) to target emotional stimuli in patients with chronic back pain.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A study included 62 patients.
Trait and state anxiety was measured using the Spilberger-Khanin questionnaire.  Cognitive evoked potentials were investigated.
The changes in parameters and topographic distribution of cognitive evoked potentials to target emotional stimuli in patients with chronic back pain with different emotional/affective states were identified.  Recording of P300 elicited by emotional stimuli allows to evaluate the characteristics of chronification of pain syndromes.
