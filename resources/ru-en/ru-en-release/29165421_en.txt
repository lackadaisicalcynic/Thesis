[Outcomes of intraocular lens implantation in the absence of capsular support: a review of current literature].
Ð¢he prevalence of complications associated with the deficiency or absence of capsular support in cataract patients is 5-15%.  Moreover, approximately 20% of patients have an inconspicuous zonular weakness, which is often left undetected preoperatively.
AIM  to classify and comparatively analyze the latest published data on the outcomes of various kinds of complicated cataract surgery.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Analysis of available literature on the subject of research published in 2003-2016.
RESULTS
The method of sutured scleral fixation of the intraocular lens (IOL) is the most fully covered in the current literature.
It has been used long enough and is, therefore, well tested.
Its typical complications include sutures degradation, hemorrhage, and inflammation.
Sutureless fixation of the IOL, which has become more common in recent years, is free of complications associated with degradation of the sutures.
However, studies on the long-term results of this technique are few and most of them were conducted in a small clinical material.
CONCLUSION
Basing on the present analysis, one may conclude that at the current level of surgery, sutureless scleral and iridal fixation of the IOL is more preferable in terms of possible postoperative complications.
