[Risk factors for vertical root fractures after endodontic treatment].  The review sought to describe the main risk factors for vertical root fracture predisposition in teeth after root canal treatment: altered mechanical characteristics of dentine due to loss of moisture and use of aggressive irrigation agents, insufficient amount of remaining dentine tissue after mechanical preparation of root canals, damage to the remaining tooth structure due to the effects of posts of different materials.
According to the reviewed studies it is difficult to reveal the main factor predisposing to vertical root fractures.
It is likely that in each case there is an interaction of several factors.
