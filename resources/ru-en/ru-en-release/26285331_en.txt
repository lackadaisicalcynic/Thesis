[Investigations into the relationship between respiratory disorders and excessive body weight in the adolescents presenting with bronchial asthma treated based at a specialized health resort facility].  A total of 71 patients with bronchial asthma (BA) were examined and treated based at a specialized health facility of whom 43 ones presented with mild asthma and 26 patients with moderately severe asthma in remission.
The median age of the patients was 12,04 Â± 2,08 years.  Spirometry parameters: MOS50, MOS75, and PSV, proved to be of high informative value combined with high enough sensitivity and specificity.
The significant difference between the groups as a whole (p < 0.05) were documented based on the serum leptin levels that were higher in the overweight patients and especially in the girls (p < 0.05).
The leptin level was a similarly sensitive/specific (AUROC > 0.5) and informative (SCDFC > 0.5) parameter which confirms its diagnostic value given it is employed in combination with overweight for the evaluation of the status of the patients suffering from asthma.
Negative linear and non-parametric correlation between the functional parameters and the serum leptin levels in the overweight patients with bronchial asthma suggests that the enhanced leptin concentration may serve as a marker of strong obstruction and severe inflammation at all levels of the respiratory tract in the patients presenting with a combination of the two conditions.
