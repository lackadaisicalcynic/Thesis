[Evaluating the effectiveness of the new mouthguard design in athletes involved in power sports].  The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the new mouthguard design for functional rehabilitation of dental system in athletes involved in contact power sports.
The functional state of dental system was evaluated by interferential electromyography of masticatory muscles and Doppler ultrasound examination of periodontal tissues.
Before mouthguard use the asynchrony of masticatory muscles was seen which was released after the mouthguard application: electromyographic activity of the left and right masticatory muscles was balanced and the decrease in biopotentials amplitude was found out.  The mouthguard also caused no functional disorders in periodontal tissues.
