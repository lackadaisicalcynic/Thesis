[The influence of the packaging on the storage qualities of the volatile substances].  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the storage qualities of the acetone and ethanol aqueous solutions kept in the polyethylene flasks, polypropylene and glass tubes that were stored under different environmental temperature.
It was shown that the acetone aqueous solution better retained its properties when stored in glass vials at room temperature as well as at 0° C and 4° C.  The most pronounced decrease of acetone concentrations (from 70 up to 95%) was documented after its storage in the polyethylene flasks.
The ethanol concentration fell down by 40% when stored in polyethylene flasks at room temperature.
