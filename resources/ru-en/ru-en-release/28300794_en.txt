[Markers of an inflammation and angiogenesis in chronic cerebrovascular diseases].
AIM  To study the diagnostic significance of additional vascular lesion markers in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Markers of inflammation (МСР-1, CRP) and angiogenesis (VEGF in blood serum and plasma) were studied in 50 patients with CCI and 60 healthy people.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
It was shown that the development of immunoinflammatory processes in patients with CCI is accompanied by the decrease in the content of vascular endothelial growth factor in the serum and blood plasma.
