[Molecular aspects of immunoprotective activity of peptides in spleen during the ageing process].  Vilon, Timogen, Crystagen and R-1 short peptides possess various immunoprotective effects in spleen during its ageing.
Both R-1 and Vilon peptides activate T-helpers.
The effect of Vilon is provided by decreased level of apoptosis, as well as the effect of R-1 peptide is provided by increased proliferation and differentiation processes.
Timogen activates B-cells by decreasing apoptosis level and increasing the proliferation of spleen cells.
Crystagen also activates B-cells of the immune system; however, the peptide doesnot cause cell renewal in spleen as it ages.
