[New visual field testing possibilities (a preliminary report)].  There are currently no portable mobile perimeters that allow visual field testing outside ophthalmologist's examination rooms.
PURPOSE  To develop a mobile perimetry technique based on use of a virtual reality headset (VR).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved 26 patients (30 eyes) with II-III stage primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) with compensated IOP.
Perimetry was performed for each patient twice - on Humphrey analyzer (test 30-2, 76 points) and employing similar strategy on a perimeter integrated into VR headset (Total Vision, Russia).
Visual field testing was performed with an interval from 1 hour to 3 days.
The results were comparatively analyzed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Patients tolerated the examination well.
Comparative analysis of preliminary perimetry results obtained with both methods showed high degree of identity, so the results were concluded to be comparable.
By visually isolating the wearer, VR headset achieves elimination of distractions and stable light conditions for visual field testing.
The headset-perimeter is compact, mobile, easily transportable, can be used in the work of visiting medical teams and for examination at home.
