[Diagnosis of coronary artery disease prior to operations on noncoronary arterial basins].  Patients presenting with noncoronary atherosclerosis are found to have accompanying lesions of coronary arteries revealed in 25-90% of cases and being a considerable factor deteriorating the prognosis.
A particular case of the given problem concerned is the development of cardiac complications in operations on noncoronary arterial basins.  Therefore, determining optimal policy for diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients of the cohort concerned still remains currently important problem in cardiology and cardiovascular surgery.
Present-day approaches to solving this problem are being considered regarded in the European and international guidelines.  The basis of preoperative diagnosis is a step-by-step algorithm which is convenient for practical application, allowing to making it possible to avoid unnecessary wanton diagnostic procedures with low risk of cardiac complications, but in patients with initially higher risk of cardiac complications in vascular operations the use of this algorithm does not allow to reveal patients with symptom-free lesions of coronary arteries.
In the presented review the authors give a detailed consideration thoroughly discuss to the problems of diagnosis of CAD in patients before operations on noncoronary arterial basins, relying upon both own studies and the critical analysis of data of world literature.
