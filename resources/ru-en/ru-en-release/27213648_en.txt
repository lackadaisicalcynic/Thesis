[The results of primary audiological examination of the children presenting with intrauterine growth retardation and normotrophics born after multifetal and singleton pregnancies].  The objective of the present work was the comparative study of the state of the acoustic analayzer in the full-term and premature infants born after multifetal (MP) or singleton (SP) pregnancies with the body weight at birth corresponding to the gestational age (normotrophics) and presenting with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).
It has demonstrated that the normotrophic babies born at the gestational age over 34 weeks after singleton pregnancy pass the DPOAEstest significantly more frequently than normotrophics of the same gestational age born after multifetal pregnancy.  Moreover, the unilateral impairment of hearing in the full-term infants born after multifetal pregnancy occurs more frequently than in those born after singleton pregnancy.
