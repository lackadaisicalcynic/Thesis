[Morphological diagnosis of viral damage to a kidney transplant].  Due to the development of organ transplantation and its accompanying immunosuppression, recent years have been marked by the higher incidence of opportunistic viral infections that are of considerable importance among posttransplantation complications.
A variety of viral infections, the possibility of their concomitant or subtle course, and the ability to cause life-threatening complications in recipients make relevant the description of existing diagnostic methods.
The article summarizes the data available in the literature on the etiology, clinical symptoms, and morphological manifestations of viral infections, such as polyomaviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses, including HSV-1, HSV-2, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus.
It describes the principles of differential diagnosis of kidney transplant damage caused by these viruses and that with acute cellular and humoral rejection, which plays an important role due to opposite approaches to treating these diseases.
