[Evaluation of the efficacy of pregabalin in the therapy of chronic pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis].
AIM  To evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin in the therapy of chronic pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study enrolled 60 patients with KOA and neuropathic pain component (NPC) (Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions (DN4) questionnaire scores, >4) who were randomized into two groups to receive aceclofenac or aceclofenac + pregabalin for 5 weeks.
All the patients underwent clinical and neurological examinations, assessment of the functional WOMAC index, pain intensity at rest and during movement, and diagnosis of neuropathic pain (NP) (DN4 and Pain DETECT questionnaires).
RESULTS
Both groups were observed to have positive changes in the studied parameters; however, combination therapy using an anticonvulsant drug (pregabalin) showed a more pronounced positive effect against not only NPC, but also the functional activity (WOMAC) and severity of pain (visual analogue scale).
CONCLUSION
Combination therapy using pregabalin in KOA patients having the signs of NP is more effective than monotherapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aceclofenac).
