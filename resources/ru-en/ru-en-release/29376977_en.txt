[Emotional and personality characteristics of patients with dystonia].
AIM  To examine emotional characteristics, especially personality profile, of patients with dystonia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Three hundred patients with dystonia were enrolled in the study.  Control groups consisted of 50 healthy individuals and 62 patients with hemifacial spasm (GFS).
HADS, Beck depression inventory and Spielberger-Khanin anxiety scale were used.
The 16 Personality Factors Questionnaire (16PF) was used to study personality profile.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Higher levels of anxiety and depression in patients with dystonia compared to the control groups were identified.
The level of anxiety and depression was not correlated with disease severity.
Personality profile study confirmed the high level of anxiety in patients with dystonia and additionally showed increased emotional instability and poor emotional control.  Intellectual personality characteristics of patients with dystonia had no differences compared to the control groups.
An analysis of socio-psychological characteristics of personality in patients with dystonia and GFS showed restricted interpersonal and social communications since the motor defect noticeable to others leads to severe social exclusion and the desire for self-isolation.
