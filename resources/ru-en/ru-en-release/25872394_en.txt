[Opportunities for confocal and laser biomicroscopy of corneal nerves in diabetic polyneuropathy].  The review concerns corneal nerves involvement in diabetes mellitus (DM), a pressing issue for ophthalmology and endocrinology.
The history of research in this field along with anatomical, physiological, and biochemical features of corneal nerves is provided.  Corneal nerves anatomy is described in accordance with Soviet scientific school and contemporary foreign sources.
The most part of the paper is devoted to technical description of a confocal microscope and Heidelberg Retina Tomograph with corneal module as well as the feasibility of corneal nerves visualization.
Diabetic neuropathy, a threatening complication of DM that can result in lower limb amputations, is discussed.
A number of authors suggest confocal biomicroscopy for early diagnosis of polyneuropathy, yet few relevant publications can be found.
If effective, confocal biomicroscopy can be considered as a possible screening tool able to detect early signs of diabetes complications and thus to ensure the treatment initiated in a timely manner.
The latter is crucial to prevent DM progression to its terminal stage--diabetic polyneuropathy, which is dangerous of lower limb amputations.
