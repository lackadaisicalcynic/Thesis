[The clinical and oncological aspects of the treatment of laryngeal and laryngopharyngeal cancer].  The objective of the present study was to estimate the justification of extended cervical lymphodissections and to evaluate the influence of adjuvant medicamental therapy in combination with the targeted treatment on the results of the management of oncological conditions.
The 81 patients included in the study were allocated to the three groups.
Group 1 was comprised of the patients (n=28) given neoadjuvant therapy and surgical treatment.  Group 2 included the patients (n=27) undergoing the surgical treatment followed by remote gamma-therapy during the postoperative period.
Group 3 consisted of the patients (n=26) receiving both the surgical treatment and targeted adjuvant medicamental therapy.
The study has demonstrated that percent of wound complications after 2--3 courses of polychemotherapy in the patients of group 1 was higher by a factor of 5 in comparison with the patients of the two other groups.
Wound healing by second intention was documented in 59% of the patients in group 1 and 10% of those in both groups 2 and 3.
The five-year survival rate in the patients of group 3 was estimated at 38.5% (6.4 and 8.9% higher than in groups 1 and 2 respectively).
