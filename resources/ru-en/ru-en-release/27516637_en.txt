Medical monitoring of asbestos-exposed workers: experience from Poland.  In Poland, the use of asbestos was banned in 1997 and asbestos plants have been closed since then.
Despite their closure, cases of asbestos-related occupational diseases among former asbestos workers are still being recorded in the Central Register of Occupational Diseases.
Between 2001 and 2014, there were 2726 asbestos-related illnesses, classified and reported as diseases associated with occupational exposure to asbestos.
In 2000, Poland introduced a programme called Amiantus, targeted at former asbestos-processing plant workers.  The programme provided periodic medical examinations to workers and free access to medications for treatment of asbestos-related illnesses.
Introduction of the programme provided additional data to generate a reliable estimation of the number of asbestos-related occupational diseases, including cancer.  The average latency period for asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma is about 40 years so there may still be some health impact to former workers necessitating follow-up.
We present the Polish experience of implementing a medical examination programme for asbestos-exposed workers and provide a list of activities to consider when planning for such a programme.
