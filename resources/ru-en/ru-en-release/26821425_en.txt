[Successful treatment for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis complicated by cerebral salt-wasting syndrome in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: A clinical case].
Cryptococcus neoformans is a common agent of fungal meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients.  Cerebral salt-wasting syndrome is one of the rare causes of severe hyponatremia in patients with CNS diseases.
The paper describes the first clinical case of a patient, whose onset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia was complicated by cryptococcal meningoencephalitis presenting with mental disorders and severe electrolytic imbalance.
Antifungal treatment with amphotericin B and fluconazole could alleviate an infectious process and metabolic disturbances.
