[The neurotoxicity biomarkers as potential indicators of the spinal cord ischemia].  The study aimed at assessing the level of glutamate receptors antibodies (Abs) in blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with spinal cord ischemia along with traditional diagnostic approaches.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Forty patients with spinal cord ischemia (10 with spinal stroke and 30 with subacute and chronic course of the disease) were enrolled.
After exclusion of some participants, 27 patients continued the study.
Comparison groups included 30 patients with ischemic stroke and 30 patients with radiculopathy.
The control group consisted of 15 healthy volunteers.
All participants underwent a neurological examination and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Abs to glutamate receptors (NR2 subunits of NMDA-receptors, AMPA/kainate receptors) were measured by ELISA.
RESULTS
NR2 Abs in patients with spinal cord ischemia were significantly increased in serum (p=0.0001) and CSF (p=0.0005) compared to controls and comparison groups.
The NR2 Abs reliably differentiated spinal cord ischemia compared to AMPA/kainate receptors and S100Î² protein.
On the other hand, increased levels of Abs to the AMPA/kainate have been detected in patients with a more severe impairment associated with extensive white matter damage.  CONCLUSION
The results show the potential of the Abs to glutamate receptors assessment in the diagnosis of spinal cord ischemia and severity of the process.
