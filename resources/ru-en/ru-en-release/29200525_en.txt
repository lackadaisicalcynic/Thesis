Mental health care during the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Sierra Leone.
Problem  Reported levels of mental health and psychosocial problems rose during the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease outbreak in Sierra Leone.
Approach
As part of the emergency response, existing plans to create mental health units within the existing hospital framework were brought forward.  A nurse-led mental health and psychosocial support service, with an inpatient liaison service and an outpatient clinic, was set up at the largest government hospital in the country.
One mental health nurse trained general nurses in psychological first aid, case identification and referral pathways.  Health-care staff attended mental well-being workshops on coping with stigma and stress.
Local setting
Mental health service provision in Sierra Leone is poor, with one specialist psychiatric hospital to serve the population of 7Â million.
Relevant changes
From March 2015 to February 2016, 143 patients were seen at the clinic; 20 had survived or had relatives affected by Ebola virus disease.
Half the patients (71) had mild distress or depression, anxiety disorders and grief or social problems, while 30 patients presented with psychosis requiring medication.
Fourteen non-specialist nurses received mental health awareness training.  Over 100 physicians, nurses and auxiliary staff participated in well-being workshops.
Lessons learnt
A nurse-led approach within a non-specialist setting was a successful model for delivering mental health and psychosocial support services during the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.
Strong leadership and partnerships were essential for establishing a successful service.  Lack of affordable psychotropic medications, limited human resources and weak social welfare structures remain challenges.
