[Conversion ratio between different botulinum neuroprotein product in neurological practice].
Despite nearly 30 years of experience in the application of botulinum toxin type A (BTA) in clinical practice, many fundamental questions of therapy remain valid.
There are 5 botulinum toxin type A used for neurological indications in the Russian Federation in 2017.  They contain different number of active neuroprotein (150 kDa) in a therapeutic dose of the drug that may have a potential impact on the efficacy and duration of action.
The current SmPC of each BTA stated that the unit of activity is unique and can not be compared with any other BTA.  In scientific publications one can find many details concerning the equivalence doses of onabotulinumtoxin A (botox) and abobotulinumtoxin A (dysport) and the ratio of units varies from 1:1 to 1:11.
However, according to clinical guidelines, systematic reviews and high quality research evidence of recent years, the ratio of units of abobotulinumtoxin A (dysport) and onabotulinumtoxin A (botox) is 3(2,5):1.
Use of a fixed ratio of units is possible only when switching from one drug to another or in case of limiting access to specific drug.
Botulinum toxin type A is the first line of therapy in the treatment of several neurological diseases.  The most commonly used drugs of botulinum toxin type A (botox, dysport, xeomin) have a significant evidence base that confirms their efficacy and optimal safety profile.
The main difference between botulinum toxin type A is their potential activity of action, i.e., activity units and total therapeutic dose.
