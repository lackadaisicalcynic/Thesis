[Gender-specific manifestations of daily physical activity and sedentary behaviour in elderly people of Surgut].  Objective of the study was to establish gender-specific characteristics of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior in elderly people living in Yugra North. 295 residents of Surgut (102 men aged 62,9±5,3 years, 35%; 193 women aged 61,9±3,8 years, 65%) were subject to a IPAQ-RU questionnaire.
The study revealed the gender-specific differences in body length and mass, body mass and body fat indices.
It was detected that more energy is spent on the housework and physical activity in the country (moderate-intensity physical activity for women and high-intensity one for men).
The study data showed no statistically significant gender-specific differences in general physical activity.
Sedentary behavior is more popular among men rather than women (2543 vs 2441 min/week).
47% of low-active men and 56% of women reported the sitting times of 6-9 hours per day, 42% - 9-12 hours per day.
Actions need to be taken to increase physical activity which is low at the moment and decrease sedentary behavior which is currently on the high level.
