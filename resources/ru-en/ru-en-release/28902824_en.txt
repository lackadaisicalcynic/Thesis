[Aneurysm of the extracranial portion of the internal carotid artery combined with kinking of its distal segment].  Presented herein is a clinical case report regarding successful operation for an aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery (measuring 4.5*8.3 cm) combined with pathological tortuosity in its distal portion.
The patient was subjected to aneurysmectomy of the left internal carotid artery with prosthetic repair.
Kinking in the distal portion of the aneurysm made it possible with minimal technical difficulties to establish a distal anastomosis during prosthetic repair.
The diagnosis of an atherosclerotic-aetiology aneurysm was morphologically confirmed.
