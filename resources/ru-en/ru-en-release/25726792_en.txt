[Cerebrovascular disease incidence in workers occupationally exposed to radiation over prolonged time periods].
OBJECTIVE
To estimate incidence rates for cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) in a cohort of workers occupationally exposed to radiation over prolonged time periods.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
CVD incidence was estimated in a cohort of 22.377 workers of the nuclear facility "Mayak" Production Association over the follow-up period 1948-2008.
Non standardized and standardized incidence rates were estimated.  An indirect method of standardization was used for the estimates.
RESULTS
As of 31/12/2008, 8.717 CVD cases (5.802 men and 2.915 women) were registered in the study cohort of workers.
CVD incidence in the cohort was significantly associated with sex, age, smoking, alcohol consumption (in men) and arterial hypertension.
CVD incidence was increased in workers exposed to external gamma-rays at total dose above 0.5 Gy and/or to internal alpha-radiation due to incorporated plutonium at total absorbed liver dose above 0.025 Gy.
CONCLUSION
CVD incidence in the cohort of workers occupationally exposed to radiation over prolonged time periods was associated both with non-radiation and radiation factors.
