[Role of microRNA in oncogenesis of pituitary tumors and their practical significance].
Microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression.
These molecules are regulators of cell proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, and differentiation.  MiRNAs are not degraded by RNAases and their concentrations can be measured in different body fluids, including serum.
The expression of miRNAs varies in intact tissues and tumors, including pituitary adenomas.
Pituitary tumors are encountered in 22.5% of the population and, in a number of cases, may be asymptomatic, but in case of invasion or/and hormone overproduction, their clinical presentation is severe with multiple symptoms leading to disability and even death.
The mechanisms for the development and progression of pituitary tumors and the markers for remission and recurrence have not been adequately investigated.
This literature review discusses the biological significance of miRNAs in pituitary tumors and the potential value of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers.
