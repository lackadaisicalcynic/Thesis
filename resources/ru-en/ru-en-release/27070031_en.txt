[The functional activity of lymphocytes in the spleen and peripheral blood in association with the toxic effect of household gas].  The objective of the present work was to study the population composition and functional activity of lymphocytes in the spleen and peripheral blood of the rats exposed experimentally to the toxic effect of household gas.
The study included the morphofunctional examination of the state of the immune organs and the immunological investigation of the population composition and functional activity of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of the experimental animals.
We also evaluated the activity of nucleic acids, NADH2-dehydrogenase, and 5'-nucleotidase.
The study revealed the relationship between the pathological and histochemical changes and the shifts in the population composition and functional activity of lymphocytes in the spleen and peripheral blood of the rats.
Specifically, the action of household gas induced by the profound inhibition of the proliferative activity of the lymphocytes, enhanced the suppressive activity of the immunoregulatory cells (T-suppressors), and altered the population composition of the effector cells in the spleen and peripheral blood.
It is concluded that the impairment of the functional activity of T-lymphocytes under the influence of household gas should be attributed not only to its direct toxic action but also to the increased activity of T-suppressors.
