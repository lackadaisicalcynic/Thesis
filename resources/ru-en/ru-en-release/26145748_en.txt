[The modern approach to the treatment of the patients presenting with vasomotor rhinitis with the use of the electrosurgical technique].  The objective of the present study was to compare, based on the clinical data, the effectiveness of the electrosurgical techniques of the molecular resonance and radio-wave ranges used to perform vasotomy in 64 patients presenting with vasomotor rhinitis.
The short-term results of the treatment suggest the higher effectiveness and safety of radio-wave surgery in comparison with the molecular resonance treatment in the patients with the above condition.  This observation was confirmed in the objective studies with the use of endoscopic and cytological methods, anterior active rhinomanometry, and determination of mucociliary clearance.
