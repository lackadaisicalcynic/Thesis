[Concurrence of acute graft rejection and polyomavirus nephropathy: A clinical case].
The paper describes a case of diagnosing acute renal graft rejection concurrent with polyomavirus nephropathy.
Histochemical and electron microscopic methods were used to examine biopsy specimens, which showed morphological changes occurring in the allograft, the ultrastructural characteristics of polyomavirus and the features of its spread in kidney tissue structures.
