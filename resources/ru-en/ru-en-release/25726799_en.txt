[The analysis of functional brain asymmetry in patients with ischemic stroke: a neuropsychological research].
UNLABELLED  Objective.
To study neuropsychological status based on functional asymmetry of patients after ischemic stroke (II).
Material and methods.
We examined 92 patients after II of different pathogenetic types (atherothrombotic, cardioembolic, lacunar).  Results.
The first-ever description of patient's neuropsychological status of II patients based on the functional asymmetry of the brain is presented.  In case of left-hemisphere lesion, parameters of expressive speech and count function were systemic factors in right-handed patients and expressive speech and praxis in left-handed patients.
In right-hemisphere lesion, basic factors were reading function in right-handed patients and praxis and count functions in left-handed patients.
CONCLUSION
The results can be used for development of rehabilitation programs in post stroke patients.
