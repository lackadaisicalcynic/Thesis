[Mo-dified scleral buckling for additional fixation of the retina with endovitreal magnetic implant (experimental study)].  Scleral buckling (SB) has been regaining its popularity in the treatment of retinal detachments.
On large clinical material, it has been proved to be the technique of choice in phakic patients with retinal detachment of moderate severity.  A combined procedure that incorporates features of episcleral as well as intravitreal surgeries has also become widely used.
Aim - to investigate the prospects for increasing technical potential of SB, particularly, to investigate the possibility of additional atraumatic mechanical fixation of the retina from within the vitreous cavity.
The proposed device consists of an episcleral magnetic buckle and endovitreal magnetic buckles (endobuckles).
The episcleral magnetic buckle is made of medical grade silicone and cannot be distinguished from common buckles, except that it contains one or more permanent magnets on the basis of neodymium-iron-boron powders.
Endobuckles are small flat elastic elements made of silicone elastomer filled with magnetic particles.  Ð•ndobuckles are implanted into the vitreous cavity through a small pars plana incision and placed on the retina at the projection of the scleral magnetic buckle.
Thus, in experiments with cadaver eyes, the authors have showed the principle feasibility of retinal fixation by the force of magnetic interaction between the magnetic scleral buckle and endobuckles.
The described technique of additional mechanical fixation of the retina provides wider surgical opportunities in the management of retinal detachments.
