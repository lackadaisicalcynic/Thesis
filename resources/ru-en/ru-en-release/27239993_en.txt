[The impact of arterial hypertension in children on dental decay activity].  One hundred and ninety-five children aged 8 to 13 years, of which 113 are diagnosed with essential arterial hypertension (EAH), and 82 children from the control group without somatic diseases including EAH were examined.
All children underwent dental examination.  The values of the substrates and the primary products of lipid peroxidation (LPO)--double bond (DB) and diene conjugates (DC) were determined.
The index of caries intensity exceeded the similar indicator in comparison with the control group of children with EAH.
The intensity of the oxidation of substrates of LPO in patients with EAH compared with healthy children was also higher.
The article discusses the index of low value of DB in patients with 1st stage of caries in combination with EAH, as a potential negative factor limiting the generation of biologically active compounds in systemic blood flow involved in the prevention of caries process.
