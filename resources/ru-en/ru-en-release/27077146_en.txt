[Molecular biological predictors for kidney cancer].  The paper considers the data available in the modern literature on studies of potential molecular predictors for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Investigations of cell death markers, namely; Bcl-2 as an inhibitor of apoptosis, are of interest.
Its high expression correlates with a more favorable prognosis.
Inactivation of Berclin 1 that is an authophagy indicator in intact tissues gives rise to t high risk for tumorigenesis.
At the same time, high Beclin 1 expression in the tissue of the tumor itself results in the lower efficiency of performed chemotherapy.
Excess annexin A2 in the tumor promotes the growth and invasion of cancer cells.
Patients with tumor over-expression of SAM68 protein involved in cell proliferation have a lower overall survival rate.
The lifespan of patients without distinct metastases survive significantly longer in the overexpression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM).
High PD-L1 protein expression on the cell membrane is considered to be a potential marker of effective immunotherapy for RCC.
