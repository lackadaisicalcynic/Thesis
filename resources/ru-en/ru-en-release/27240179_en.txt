[Post-stroke cognitive impairment and the possibility of treatment with cellex].
OBJECTIVE  To present neuropsychological characteristics of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) in acute ischemic stroke (IS) and to assess the efficacy of the drug cellex.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A comprehensive neuropsychological testing battery was administered to 288 patients with acute IS.
In addition to basic therapy, 30 patients received cellexin the dosage of 0.1 mg (1 ml) subcutaneously for 10 days, treatment was started in the acute phase.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Multifunctional PSCI were revealed in 87% of patients with acute IS.
Impairments of attention, regulatory functions, speech and memory were identified in the majority of patients.
More than a third of patients had multifunctional nonamnestic PSCI.
Monofunctionalnonamnestic PSCI were found in 5.5% of patients.
Isolated deficit of memory was observed in 2% of patients.
PSCI with the predominance of mixed character were found mostly in elderly patients.
In the group of young and middle-aged patients,there was a decrease in isolated speed reduction or regulation of cognitive activity, combined cognitive impairment was detected in every fourth patient.  There was a trend towards an increase in the age of patients withPSCI of the mixed character.
An analysis of the efficacy of cellex in acute IS has shown that the drug improves cognitive status as well as the state of neurodynamic, regulatory and visuospatial functions.
Therefore, cellex is effective in treatment of PSCI in acute IS.
