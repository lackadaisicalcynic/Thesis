[The specific morphological and biochemical features of inhalation poisoning with ammonia].  This experimental study using the laboratory animals (rats and rabbits) has demonstrated the morphological and biochemical changes associated with inhalation poisoning with ammonia.
Certain regular features of this form of intoxication were revealed.
Specifically, the determination of the major biochemical characteristics of blood makes it possible to evaluate the performance of the hepatobiliary and cardiovascular systems.
The results of blood pH measurement give evidence of its alkalinization.
