[Imaging of neoangiogenesis of internal carotid artery's atherosclerotic plaque by contrast-enhanced sonography and histological examination].
Previously, atherosclerosis was considered a disease accompanied exclusively by lipids accumulation.
At present time success of fundamental and experimental science confirmed that atherosclerotic process is also associated with neovascularization and prolonged inflammatory response at all stages of atherogenesis from initial manifestations to thrombotic complications.
The cause of atherosclerotic plaque instability is neovascularization, which is accompanied by intra-plaque hemorrhage and damage.  Complications of carotid arteries atherosclerosis are strokes and transient ischemic attacks.
The use of a wide range of diagnostic and pathohistological techniques is required for assessing this pathology.  The most promising diagnostic technique is Contrast Enhanced Ultrasonography (CEUS) which allows to assess neovascularization degree in atherosclerotic plaque through the injection of a contrast agents.
