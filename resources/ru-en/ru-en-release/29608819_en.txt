[Elderly and state: specificity of relationships in contemporary Russia on the example of elderly residents of Saint-Petersburg.]
The article presents the sociological research results of paternalistic attitudes that determine relationships between the state and the elderly in the context of new socio-economic conditions.
It was revealed that the previous paternalistic expectations of the elderly are stable and manifested more in the older age group (71-90 years old).  The younger age group of the elderly (55-70 years old) begins to distance themselves from the guardianship of the state and relies more on their own resources under new circumstances.
Four types of elderly persons were revealed that are differentiated by the degree of social situation reflection adequacy, the state resources reliance, and their own activity.
Paternalism takes on new forms, reflected in older generation citizens' mentality.
