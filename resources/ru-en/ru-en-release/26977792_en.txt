[Long-term outcomes of SDR in various groups of cerebral palsy (CP) patients].  AIM
Long-term outcomes of selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) are not sufficiently summarized in the literature.  The aim of this study was to systematize and evaluate long-term outcomes of SDR in various groups of cerebral palsy (CP) patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
47 patients with spastic CP were operated.
In all cases, SDR of the L1-S1 roots was performed under EMG control.
In all cases, laminoplasty was used as an approach.
Outcomes of surgical treatment were estimated by the Ashworth scale and the GMFM 88 scale.
The data were subjected to statistical analysis.
The follow-up duration ranged from 12 months to 7 years.
RESULTS
A significant reduction in spasticity from 4.34±0.53 points before surgery to 1.61±0.45 points after surgery (p<0.001) was observed in most cases.
The dynamics of locomotor functions was maximal in the 3rd GMFM class: changing from 48±4% points before operation to 52±6% points 12 months after operation (p<0.042).
The dynamics of locomotor functions amounted to 2% in the 4th GMFM class and 1% in the 5th GMFM class.
The best functional outcomes were obtained in children under 10 years of age.
A positive correlation only between the percentage of cut roots and a decrease in spasticity (r= 0.85) was found.
No correlation between the amount of cut roots and the dynamics of locomotor functions was observed.
No spinal cord deformities were observed during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION
A reduction in spasticity due to SDR depends on the amount of cut roots.
The functional result of SDR is affected not only by a decrease in spasticity but also by the functional status and age of the patient at the time of surgery.
In all cases, laminoplasty should be performed to prevent spinal cord deformities.
