[Thoracoscopic lung resection in children].  The spectrum of pulmonary surgical pathology in newborns and infants is mainly presented by congenital diseases.
Surgery is the main radical method of treatment of children with congenital lung diseases.
By this time in the N.F.Filatov City Children's Hospital No13 it is performed more than 1000 endoscopic operations on the thoracic cavity including more than 300 lung resections.  More than 190 cases were caused by congenital lung disease.
The results of treatment of 194 infants with congenital lung disease for the period 2005-2014 are analyzed in this article.  14 (22%) patients were operated urgently.
8 patients (12%) with compensated respiratory failure underwent surgery at the age of 8 to 46 days.  Children with absence of clinical manifestations underwent thoracoscopic lung resection at the age of 3 to 8 months.
Thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed in the 40 cases (62%).  There were no intraoperative complications.
Thoracoscopic lung resection for malformations in newborns and infants is currently the method of choice.
It allows to visualize pathological focus intraoperatively and to perform precise dissection of pulmonary root structures using modern equipment.  Thus, it improves course of postoperative period and reduces duration of hospital-stay.
Repeated lung resection in patients with recurrent tuberculosis of operated lung (literature review and own data).
