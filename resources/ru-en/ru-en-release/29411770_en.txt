[Alirocoumab: new perspectives of lipid-lowering therapy].
Alirocoumab (Praluent) is a fully human monoclonal antibody against proprotein covertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).
The data of ODYSSEY Phases II and III clinical trials demonstrate the high efficacy of alirocoumab in lowering the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, with a considerable advantage over control groups (placebo, ezetimibe or modified statin therapy) in both monotherapy and combination therapy with statins and other lipid-lowering agents.
Alirocoumab provides additional lipid-lowering effects against other atherogenic fractions of cholesterol, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a).
The agent show high safety and good tolerability and it can be considered as the drug of choice for patients who have not reached their target LDL cholesterol levels after statin therapy and have statin intolerance and familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia.
There are now the preliminary results of a secondary analysis of data from the ODYSSEY LONG TERM study, suggesting that alirocoumab therapy may be accompanied by a lower risk of cardiovascular events.
The final results will be provided after the data of a study of cardiovascular outcomes after therapy with alirocoumab versus placebo (ODYSSEY OUTCOMES) are published.
