[Changes in gingival blood circulation in patients with provisional fixed acrylic dentures].  The adhesion of oral microorganisms to the surface of teeth and dental restorative materials is often the starting point in the developments of caries and periodontal disease.
Formation of biofilm on the surface provisional acrylic bridge is especially quickly and can potentially generate decay or periodontal disease on the teeth.  Occlusion trauma and occlusion disorders effects on increasing of injure regional periodontal tissues.
Using ultrasonic doppler diagnostics oral mucosal blood flow was measured in 79 patients with periodontitis of medium severity with different hygiene conditions before and during orthopedic treatment by provisional fixed dentures was model by different methods.
According to the results of this study was stated optimization of oral mucosal blood flow after pre-prosthetic treatments and the supportive hygiene periodontal care during the treatment.
Results was used for reduce of functional stress in the in periodontal tissues during the orthopedic alignment by the use of fixed dentures.  Specific prosthodontic hygiene protocol and model by individual articulator must be used to treat patients with widespread chronic periodontitis by interim prostheses.
