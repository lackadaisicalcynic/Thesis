[Russian and regional performance indices of local therapists].
AIM  To analyze the statistical indicators of a local therapist's performance in the Russian Federation and its districts in the 2008- 2012 period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The authors analyzed staffing and understaffing in the federal districts with respect to the Russian Federation, a doctor's actual function and its deviation ratio, staffing of local therapists, secondary employment coefficient, and the total number of physician visits with the ratio of the number of home/polyclinic ones.  RESULTS
The staffing of local therapists was steady-state in the country as a whole in the period analyzed.  At the same time, there was a decline in staffing.
The performance of doctors everywhere is greater than the recommended one since 2009.  There was a reduction in the number of visits to local therapists in both the country as a whole and its regions, with more visits being made by rural dwellers.
CONCLUSION
The current approach to the standards for the load and number of physicians should determine needs for specialists of this profile and become a major part to solve the problem of delivering available and high-quality primary outpatient care to the population of Russia.
