[Computerized method of objectification of dizziness and vertigo and differential diagnostic of vestibulopathies].
OBJECTIVE
To create a complex computerized method of objectification of dizziness and vertigo, and differentiation of vestibulopathies of various geneses using electrooculography approach that allows to record and analyze spontaneous, vestibular- and visually-induced eye movements, with the following classification (discriminant) analysis of the results obtained.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  The study involved 69 patients of different sex and age complained of dizziness, vertigo and disequilibrium, and 64 healthy men.
Based on the results of clinical examination, patients were divided into three groups: patients with peripheral vestibulopathy, patients with central vestibulopathy and patients with psychogenic vestibulopathy.
Electrooculography was performed using the hardware-software complex (HSC) "OCULOSTIM-CM".
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Significant diagnostic parameters based on the recognition and analysis of spontaneous, vestibular- and visually-induced eye movements were coefficients of efficacy and increased frequency of fixation saccades and smooth pursuit with- and without retinal optokinetic stimulation.  We developed the algorithm and complex computerized method for differentiation of different types of vestibulopathy.
