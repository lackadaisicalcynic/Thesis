[A neuroprotective approach to optimizing treatment and correction activities in children with autism spectrum disorders].
AIM
To study neuroprotective properties of heat shock proteins and neurotrophins in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sixty-eight children with ASD (ICD-10 F84), aged from 5 to 12 years, were examined.  General clinical examination and evaluation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), heat shock proteins (Hsp27, Hsp70) in the blood serum were performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
There was a decrease in NGF, BDNF, Hsp27, Hsp70 in the total group and in boys with severe ASD.
These changes reflect the deterioration of neuroprotective processes in the brain in children with ASD that demands further research and development of treatment procedures.
