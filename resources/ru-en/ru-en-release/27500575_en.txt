We undertook the analysis of genetic polymorphism of the HLADQA1 and DQB1 genes in the patients presenting with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (n=21) with the use of the multiprimer polymerase chain reaction.
The results of the study give evidence that the identification of DQ 2.5 and DQ 7.5 haplotypes encoded by the DQA1 *0501, DQB1 *0201, DQA1 *0505, and DQB1 *0301 alleles as well as the carriage of type 16 human papilloma virus (HPV) in combination with these haplotypes in the patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis can be used for the prognostication of the severity of this disease.
