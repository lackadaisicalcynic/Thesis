[The investigation of kinematic features of gait in healthy subjects and patients with post-stroke atactic disorders].  AIM
To study spatial/temporal parameters of gait in post-stroke vestibular-atactic syndrome.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors investigated the speed, rhythmic and angle parameters of the gait in healthy subjects (n=15) and in patients with atactic disorders in the recovery period of vertebrobasillar ischemic stroke (n=15).
Physical examination with elements of anthropometry, clinical assessment of gait function with the Dynamic Gait Index, objective assessment of gait parameters using the system for 3D movement video analysis VICON Motion Capture Systems were used.
RESULTS
There were a statistically significant decrease in the speed and pace of the gait, increase in the step duration and duration of the double support phase.  The speed and rhythmic parameters of the left and right lower limb differed significantly.
A delay of the moments of foot lifting from the surface was observed.  Authors also revealed a decrease in the amplitude of flexion and extension in all segments of the lower limbs in the double step phase.
These characteristics represent the activation of the «sitting» strategy and facilitate the objective assessment of the hyperfunction of the reactive postural synergies in patients with post-stroke atactic disorders.
