[A retrospective analysis of the effect of pregnancy on the course of multiple sclerosis].  AIM
For a long time it was believed that pregnancy worsens the clinical course of multiple sclerosis.  In several European countries, there have been several studies that have demonstrated remission of autoimmune aggression during pregnancy.
We studied the effect of pregnancy on the course of multiple sclerosi.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A retrospective analysis of disease course of 279 patients was performed for the first time in three major Russian centers (Moscow, Novosibirsk, Tyumen).  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
There was a remission of autoimmune aggression during pregnancy.
The use of DMT before pregnancy was a predictor of a more favorable course of the disease after delivery.
An earlier beginning of DMT after delivery led to a significant risk reduction of relapses.
