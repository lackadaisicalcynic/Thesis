[Perampanel in the treatment of patients with epilepsy].  Development of new antiepileptic drugs (AED) does not stop due to the fact that the number of patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy remains at about 30%.
One of the newest AEDs is perampanel (PER), a selective, non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist to target post-synaptic glutamate transmission.
PER is approved in the Russian Federation as adjunctive treatment for focal seizures with or without secondarily generalized seizures and for primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) in patients with epilepsy aged â‰¥12 years.
The drug is effective and well-tolerated in the dose of 4-8 mg/day, and most side effects are dose-dependent.  The high efficacy of PER combined with the good tolerability, absence of life-threatening adverse reactions and convenient intake allow us to recommend PER as the first choice additional drug in treatment of patients with epilepsy.
