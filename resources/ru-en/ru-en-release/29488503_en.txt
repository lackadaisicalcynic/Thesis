[Observation of the intra-adenoid cysts in the nasopharynx].  The objective of the present study was to demonstrate the clinical significance and possibilities of diagnostics and treatment of the intra-adenoid cysts in the nasopharynx as exemplified by an original observation of an individual case.
The cystic structures in the nasopharynx rarely manifest themselves clinically and are known to produce the non-specific symptoms.
The patients admitted to the L.I. Sverzhevskiy Research Institute of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology for the surgical treatment of nasopharyngeal cysts account for 0.05% of the total number of the hospitalized subjects.
This article reports a case of two large intra-adenoid cysts in the nasopharynx of one patient complicated by bilateral exudative otitis media.
The successful outcome of the surgical treatment of this condition was achieved by means of endonasal marsupilization of the cysts under the laser-assisted endoscopic control with simultaneous bilateral shunting of the tympanic cavity.
