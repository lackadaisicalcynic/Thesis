[The peculiar features and significance of the psycho-emotional status of the patient in the context of functional and aesthetic rhinosurgery].  The objective of the present study was to summarize the literature data concerning the peculiar features of the psycho-emotional status of the patients presenting with nasal deformities and the importance of its evaluation for the preparation for the surgical rhinoplastic intervention.
We present the results of analysis of the materials pertinent to the history and the current state of the psychological aspects of rhinoplasty, the importance of the development and application of the diagnostic tools for the evaluation of the psycho-emotional status of the patients presenting with deformations of the external nose.
It is concluded that the disregard of the psycho-emotional status of the patients by a thonosurgeon and the resulting mistakes in determining indications for the surgical intervention can be the causes accounting for the patient's dissatisfaction with the outcome of even an ideally performed operation.
