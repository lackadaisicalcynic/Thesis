[Suicidality in the elderly: socio-cultural and clinical risk factors].  Advanced age is a significant risk factor for a completed suicide.
The review considers the patterns of suicidal behavior of older adults in the context of their gender, ethnicity as well as social and cultural factors.  In terms of pro- and antisuicidal variables, special emphasis is made on the role of somatic and psychic disorders.
The article looks at the features of committing a suicide peculiar to the older people and debates some specific issues of self-inflicted death by elderly people.
The obtained data indicate the involvement of multilevel factors (biological, clinical, cultural, micro- and microsocial) in suicidal behavior in later life.
