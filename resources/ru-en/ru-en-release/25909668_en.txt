[The ototoxic action of cisplatin on the middle ear].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ototoxic action of cisplatin after its single administration using an experimental model (white mice).
Short latency acoustically evoked potentials (SAEP) and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were recorded for the purpose.  The results of the study confirm the possibility of using the proposed model for the estimation of the cisplatin-induced loss of hearing.
It was shown that a single cisplatin dose causes hearing impairment in the mice within 7 days after its administration; with the maximum effect becoming apparent on day 30.
