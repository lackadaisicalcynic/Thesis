[Enteral failure and metabolic syndrome: Common neurohormonal mechanisms of development, possibilities of their rational therapy].
The paper deals with small bowel (SB) functional disorders in metabolic syndrome (MS).  The main components of a cascade of metabolic abnormalities in MS are closely due to SB functional changes.
This is associated to some extent with the presence of common neurohormonal mechanisms in the development of enteropathy and MS.
The paper gives the physical, laboratory and instrumental methods for identifying SB dysfunctions in patients with MS.
Therapy for the latter is of particular interest in the context of SB functional recovery.
The authors discuss the possibilities of enteropathy therapy in patients with MS; thus there is not only SB functional recovery, but also improved overall metabolic processes.
