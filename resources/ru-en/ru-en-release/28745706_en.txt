[The combination of endoscopic techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of various forms of infertility in women].
AIM
To improve the methods of simultaneous laparoscopy and hysteroscopy for the diagnosis and treatment of various forms of secondary infertility.
MATERIAL AND METHODS  420 women with various forms of infertility were examined and treated at the Caspian Hospital (Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology).
Patients were divided into three groups: tubal-peritoneal infertility - 212 women, different forms of endometriosis - 113 patients, polycystic ovarian disease - 95 women.  We proposed safer method of laparoscopic surgery.
RESULTS
There were no injuries of internal organs and bleeding from the puncture site if Veress needle and the first 'blind' trocar were deployed according to proposed method.  We consider that choice of operative hysteroscopy technique should be differentiated in case of benign gynecological diseases.
Anesthesia-free operative hysteroscopy by S. Bettocchi may be performed if diagnostic hysteroscopy is tolerable.
Simultaneous laparoscopy and hysteroscopy are safe for patients.
