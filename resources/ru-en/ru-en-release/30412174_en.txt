[The specific immunophenotypic features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma].  We have undertaken the retrospective analysis of the medical histories of 119 patients presenting with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and the biopsy specimens obtained from them; the wereinvestigated with the use of the histological (staining of the micropreparations with hematoxylin and eosin) and immunehistochemical (monoclonal murine antibodies against Pan-cytokeratin, CK 5/6, EBV, CK7, CK19, p16) techniques.
The study has demonstrated the presence of non-differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma in 97 patients, diffuse large-cell B-lymphoma in 18 ones, melanoma of the nasopharyngeal mucous membrane in 2, and nasopharyngeal rhabdosarcoma in 1 patient.
The immunohistochemical study revealed co-expression of the markers of Epstein-Barr virus, Pan-cytokeratin, and CK 5/6 in the non-differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma .
