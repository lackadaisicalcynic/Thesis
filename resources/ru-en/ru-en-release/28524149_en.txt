[Morphological features of clinical manifestations of particular congenital lens and vitreous anomalies].
The review covers general clinical features of particular congenital anomalies of the human eye associated with its abnormal embryonic development.  Principal literature sources on evaluation of congenital changes in the vitreous body and identification of its 'underdevelopment' in certain types of congenital cataracts have been studied.
The said changes were analyzed with account to general pathology of the human body as well as local morphological manifestations.
Covered is the time period from the end of the XIX century to the present.  According to the authors, their analysis helps justify the use of digital three-dimensional ultrasound examination for intravital evaluation of congenital changes in the lens and vitreous.
