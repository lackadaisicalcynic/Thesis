[Minipterional craniotomy in surgery for anterior circle of Willis aneurysms].  One of the significant events in aneurysm surgery was promotion of a microneurosurgical technique by G. Yasargil.
Despite its versatility, pterional craniotomy is associated with extensive osteotomy and a significant incision of the skin and temporal muscle, which may lead to the adverse cosmetic effects, risk of temporomandibular joint dysfunction, injury to the frontal branch of the facial nerve, and facial and scalp numbness.
We present our experience with minipterional craniotomy in surgery for anterior circle of Willis aneurysms in 40 patients.
There were no serious complications or deaths.
Also, there were no intraoperative aneurysm ruptures.
All patients had expected transient hypesthesia in the temporal region, which was not considered as a complication.  This region was significantly smaller compared to that in classical pterional craniotomy.
Patients assessed the postoperative cosmetic outcome as excellent.
