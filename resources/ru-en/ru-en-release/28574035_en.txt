[Vascular pathology in the aspect of sudden death in young adults and connective tissue dysplasia: anatomical, physiological, and morphological parallels].
Vascular pathology in young adults has during the last 10 years been diagnosed more often during forensic medical examination of sudden death.
Major morphological alterations are revealed in cerebral vessels, coronary vessels, and at the level of the ascending portion of the aorta.
Generally, in the young age there is no stenosing atherosclerosis inducing vascular lesions and the development of complications.  It was determined that connective tissue dysplasia is pathology wherein weakness of the vascular wall is genetically preconditioned, thus promoting formation of vascular aneurysms and rupture of the latter under conditions of provoking factors such as going in for sports, physical loads, and psychoemotional stress.
