[Aspects of encephalopathy in oncologic patients after chemotherapy].
OBJECTIVE
To study clinical presentations and neuroimaging results in post chemotherapy encephalopathy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
We examined 27 patients with cancer after chemotherapy (n=16) or chemoradiation (n=11).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
All patients complained of memory impairment, sluggish mentality, moderate headache, fatigue, sleep disorder, irritability.  Their neurologic status included different organic symptoms.
Post chemotherapy encephalopathy is characterized by the combination of severe cerebral asthenia and different organic neurologic symptoms with moderate cephalgic syndrome.  MRT showed single and multiple loci of gliosis in the white matter.
