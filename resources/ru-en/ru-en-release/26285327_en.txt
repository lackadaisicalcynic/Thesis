[The influence of intravenous laser irradiation of the blood on the dynamics of leptin levels and the quality of life of the patients presenting with rheumatoid arthritis].  AIM
The objective of the present study was to estimate the influence of intravenous laser irradiation of the blood on the dynamics of leptin levels and the quality of life of the patients presenting with rheumatoid arthritis.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 132 patients at the age varying from 18 to 65 (mean 52.9 Â± 11.3) years presenting with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were available for the examination.
The diagnosis of RA was based on the results of clinical, laboratory, and instrumental studies in accordance with the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) dated 2010.
The patients were divided into two groups.
The control group was comprised of the patients who received the traditional medicamental treatment alone (n = 30) while the study group consisted of the patients given a course of intravenous laser irradiation of the blood in addition to the traditional medicamental treatment (n = 102).The course of intravenous laser therapy was performed with the use of a Matrix-VLOK apparatus ("Matrix", Russia) by means of the VLOK + UBI procedure.
Each course consisted of 10 sessions per patient without a break for the weekend.
RESULTS
The data obtained indicate that the patients with rheumatoid arthritis had the increased plasma leptin level suggesting the development of the inflammatory process.  Moreover, the quality of the patients' life was deteriorated.
CONCLUSION
The results of this study demonstrate that the combined treatment by means of low-intensity laser irradiation is accompanied by the normalization of the plasma leptin level, suppression of the inflammatory process, and a significant improvement of the quality of life of the patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.
