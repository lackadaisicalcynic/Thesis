[The reconstruction of the human body length from the wrist size].  The objective of the present study was to develop the regression models for the reconstruction of the human body length from the wrist size taking into consideration the availability of the results of the measurements of the palm fragments or the wrist undergoing muscular contracture.
The study included 106 Caucasoid subjects (41 men and 65 women) at the age varying from 18 to 76 years.
The following parameters were measured: body length, wrist length, the length of the fingers and phalanges on the back of the hand, palmar length and width, ulnar edge size of the palm.
It was shown that the selected longitudinal dimensions of the palm and fingers can be used to estimate the body length as accurately as from the wrist length.
The high prognostic value of ulnar edge size of the palm was documented which allows this characteristic to be used in the cases of partial palm destruction or in the wrist with pronounced flexion contracture of the fingers.
The most exact equations are those derived from the combination of the results of the measurement of the fingers and the ulnar edge size of the palm.
Less accurate equations are based on the palmar dimensions alone and on the total wrist size with the exception of the equation for the wrist length with regard to the subject's sex.
The gender information needs to be taken into account if the wrist is preserved to the extent that only the length of the palm and of the IV and V fingers can be measured or if the wrist is sufficiently long and wide (short and wide) and the gender is supposed to be masculine.  In contrast, this information should be disregarded if the wrist is long and narrow (short and narrow) and the gender is supposedly feminine.
