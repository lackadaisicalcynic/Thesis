[A case of progressive glaucoma against the background of chronic constipation].  The authors describe a case of severe glaucoma in the only seeing eye of a patient with venous circulation disturbance resulting from a chronic anal fissure complicated with progressive anal stenosis, severe sphincter spasm, and pain syndrome.
The article presents the results of multiple clinical ophthalmological tests and instrumental examinations performed before and after surgical intervention that evidence the importance of venous circulation disturbances for glaucoma development.
