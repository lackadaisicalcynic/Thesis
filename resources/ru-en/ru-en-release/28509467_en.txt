[Age characteristics of the cardiovascular system, depending on the thyroid function in type 2 diabetes mellitus].  To study the features of cardiovascular system in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 considering the thyroid pathology and age, 264 patients were examined.
They were divided into three groups: 1st - patients with diffuse-nodular changes in the thyroid gland, 2nd - patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, 3rd - a control group of patients without thyroid disease.  The patients of different ages were examined in each of these groups.
All patients were in euthyroid state.
It was established that identified in diabetes mellitus type 2 thyroid pathology and the thyroid disease contribute special features to the clinical picture for combined diabetic and cardiovascular pathology even in a euthyroid state including the age features.
The laboratory and instrumental researches showed that the patients with combined diabetes and thyroid pathology have a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, and ventricular arrhythmias of high grades.
They also were noticed to have a more adverse form of the left ventricle remodeling, also the combination of diastolic and systolic dysfunctions were found to be more frequent.  It was concluded about the necessity of early diagnosis and correction of the cardiovascular disorders and thyroid systems in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, including euthyroid patients.
