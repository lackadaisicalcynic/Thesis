Implementation of tuberculosis prevention for exposed children, Burkina Faso.
Objective
To develop and test a simple system for recording and reporting the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection and to compare the effects of passive and active tracing of child contacts on indicators of such infection.
Methods
We revised Burkina Faso's latent tuberculosis infection register and quarterly tuberculosis reporting form.  Subsequently, coverage of the routine screening of contacts, who were younger than five years, for active tuberculosis and the corresponding percentages of such contacts who, if eligible, initiated preventive therapy were measured, nationwide, between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017.
In 2016, we evaluated indicators of latent tuberculosis infection in the Hauts-Bassins region before and after community health workers had begun the active tracing of contacts who were younger than five years.  Findings
In Burkina Faso, during our study period, 3717 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and 1166 corresponding contacts who were younger than five years were reported as the result of routine screening and passive contact tracing.
The overall contact:index ratio was 0.31 and corresponding screening coverage was 82.0% (956/1166) and proportion of children starting on preventive treatment was 90.5% (852/941).  Active tracing in Hauts-Bassins led to a substantially higher contact/index ratio (1.83) and screening coverage (99.3%; 145/146).
The newly established recording and reporting system proved feasible and user-friendly and allowed measurement of global indicators of latent tuberculosis infection.  Compared with active tracing, passive tracing led to much lower estimates of the numbers of child contacts.
