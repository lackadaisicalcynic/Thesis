[Cardiac arrest after induction of anesthesia in neurosurgical patients].
The paper reports two clinical cases observed with a time lag of four years.
In both cases, there were severe clinical symptoms of intracranial hypertension before the surgery.
Prompt full-scale resuscitation was required in both cases due to asystole that developed immediately after induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation.
In one case, cardiac activity was successfully recovered by complex resuscitation with the emergency drainage of the cerebral ventricles.
The possible causes of complications and preventive measures were discussed.
