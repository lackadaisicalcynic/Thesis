[Age-related changes in the content of sirtuin 1 in fibroblasts of human dermis].  The goal of our work was to examine content of sirtuin 1 in human skin at different ages to uncover a role of sirtuin 1 in aging of human skin.
Sirtuin 1, proliferating cells nuclear antigen (PCNA) were detected by indirect immunohistochemistry in sections of the skin of human fetuses died antenatally from 22 to 40 weeks of pregnancy and humans from birth to 85 years old, died from various causes.
Our results showed that the level of sirtuin 1 in dermal fibroblasts was decreased from prenatal period to 85 years old.
Both the number of fibroblasts and their proliferative activity were also decreased through life.  Age-related decrease in sirtuin 1 content in dermal fibroblasts is statistically significant correlated with age-dependent decrease in proliferation.
Therefore, lowering of sirtuin 1 content in dermal fibroblasts occurring with age can be regarded as a mechanism which leads to inhibition of proliferation of dermal fibroblasts.
