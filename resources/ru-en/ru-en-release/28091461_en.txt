[Use of somatostatin analogues in the pancreonecrosis therapy (kliniko-experimental research)].
The article is devoted to the study and optimization of therapeutic strategy in pancreatic necrosis.  We studied the effectiveness of clinical application of human somatostatin analog - octreotide in different dosages.
Submitted investigationconsists of experimental and clinical parts.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Experimentalmodel of acute destructive pancreatitis onrats of Wistar line with weight of 300Â±30 gwas reproduced.
There were 5 animal groups (one control group and four experimental groups).
Experimental animals received oktreotidin different doses.
In 2 days there were estimated the blood biochemistryand histopathologic features of liver and pancreas of operated animals.
In clinical part there were formed two groups of patients out of selected case histories by a principle of similarity of complex therapy differing in oktreotid doses, namely: 1) pancreatonecrosis patients estimated of 3 to 8 points by Ranson scale in whose treatment regimen oktreotid 300 mkg/day (n=70) dose was included; 2) pancreatonecrosispatients estimated of 3 to 8 points by Ransonin whose treatment regimenoktreoid1200 mkg/day (n=38) was included.
There were compared indices of lethal outcomes, average bed-days, and dynamics of laboratory findings, number and volume of surgical procedures.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Dose-related effect of a synthetic analogue of somatostatin, acetateoktreotid, was proved.
Introduction in complex therapy of pancreatonecrosisthe highest possible authorized doses of oktreotid (1200 mkg/day) is conducive to more favorable course of illness, dynamic reduction of amilazemia, decrease of lethal outcomes and total bed-day, and also, reduction of initial and repeated operative procedures.
