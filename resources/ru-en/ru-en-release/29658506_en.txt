[The relationship between indicators of drug users detection and the population referral to drug treatment services].
AIM  To examine the relationship between the results of drug users' identification through medical examination for drug intoxication and the rates of primary population' referral for drug treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The data of the state federal statistical observation for period of 2009-2013 were used.
Methods of descriptive statistics and regression analysis were applied.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
It has been established that the identification of drug users during medical examination of citizens for the state of drug intoxication has a statistically significant effect on the population' drug treatment referral rates.
According to linear regression equations, out of each 100 cases identified through medical examination, only 15 patients referred to drug treatment services.
From practical point of view, the influence of the first indicator on the second one is not high: an increase in the number of identified drug users for each 100 cases leads to an increase in referral rate of patients with drug dependence syndrome for 2 cases, while the referral rate of drug users with established diagnosis of the harmful use of drugs increases for 10 patients.
The results of the study highlight the urgent need for developing secondary prevention programs for those diagnosed with the harmful use of drugs.
There is also a question of further improvement of legislation in the field of law-governed motivation of exposed drug users to seek drug treatment.
