[Aneurysm of the gastroduodenal artery in a female patient with the postcholecystectomy syndrome (a clinical case report)].
Aneurysms of visceral arteries appear to belong to rare and potentially lethal vascular diseases.
The most important role in the aetiology of aneurysms of the gastroduodenal artery is plaid by either acute or chronic pancreatitis.  The article deals with a clinical case report concerning a saccular partially thrombosed aneurysm having developed in a 77-year-old woman presenting with the postcholecystectomic syndrome and detected on ultrasonographic examination of the abdominal-cavity vessels.
Timely radiodiagnosis (SCT angiography of abdominal cavity vessels), adequate and timely performed endovascular occlusion of the cavity of the aneurysm with metal spirals performed in a timely manner made it possible to attain a favourable outcome.
Little is known regarding the understanding of the aetiology and lack of full clarity in therapeutic approaches to aneurysms of visceral arteries predetermine the necessity to continue collecting clinical case reports concerning this rarely encountered vascular pathology in order to generalize and work out an appropriate therapeutic-and-diagnostic algorithm.
