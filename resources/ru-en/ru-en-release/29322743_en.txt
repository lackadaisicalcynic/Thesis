[Studies of the dc-potential of the brain level distribution in elderly women with high anxiety.]  The article presents the results of studies of the direct current (DC) potential of the brain level distribution in elderly women with high anxiety.
Analysis of the DC-potential of the brain level distribution was held by mapping obtained by measuring the monopolar values of the DC-potential of the brain and calculating deviations in each of the leads from the average records which were registrated in all areas of the head.  The results of the study indicate an increase in the background level of the DC-potential in most parts of the brain and the peculiarity of its distribution in elderly women with a high level of anxiety.
A tendency to deformation of interhemispheric asymmetry with a predominance of energy costs in the central region of the right hemisphere and a smoothing of interhemispheric asymmetry in the temporal and parietal regions have been revealed.
The obtained data allow to assume the influence of high anxiety on the change in energy metabolism of the brain in the ederly.
