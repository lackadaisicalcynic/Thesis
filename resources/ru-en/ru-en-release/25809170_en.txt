[Intradural extramedullary myxoma at the L1 level].  Myxoma of the peripheral nerve sheath is a rare benign tumor with predominant localization in the upper extremities, head, neck, and chest.
In this study, we reported a clinical case of a patient with intradural myxoma at the L1 level.
Much attention was given to histological characterization of the tumor and differential diagnosis of histological types of benign extramedullary tumors.
A conclusion was drawn that patients with myxoma need further thorough examination as there is a risk of generalization of tumor process.
