[Surgical treatment of large and giant vertebrobasilar aneurysms manifested by brainstem compression symptoms].  The study aim was to analyze the results of surgical treatment of vertebrobasilar (VB) aneurysms manifested by brainstem compression symptoms.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 8 patients operated on in the period between 2014 and 2017.
All patients underwent intravascular intervention; two patients had open surgery at the second stage.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Intravascular intervention, both alone and in combination with open surgery, is effective treatment of VB aneurysms whose clinical picture is manifested by brainstem compression symptoms.
The use of flow-diverting stents in most cases has provided good radicalness in the long-term period, without worsening the functional outcome.  Treatment of fusiform aneurysms of the basilar artery trunk requires separate consideration and an individual approach due to a high risk of thrombosis of short branches feeding the brainstem.
