[The application of the hidrogel-based medicinal compositions for the targeted delivery of medications in rhino- and otosurgery].  The objective of the present study was the analysis of the application of the hydrogel-based medicinal compositions for the treatment of the patients presenting with pathological changes in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses during the postoperative period.
A total of 25 patients at the age from 18 to 60 years with the diseases of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses were available for the examination including 12 ones with polypous polysinusitis and 13 patients having benign neoplasms in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and the base of the skull.  All these patients underwent endoscopic endonasal polysinusotomy.
After the surgical intervention was completed, the postoperative cavities were filled up with a gel containing sodium alginate, sodium hyaluronate, and dioxydin.  This procedure was followed by the tamponade with the use of the silicone oil tampons in conformity with the standard method.
The application of the polyfunctional depot-materials in the combination with the physiotherapeutic treatment modalities made it possible to accelerate the wound healing processes including epithelization, changes in the mucous membrane of the paranasal sinuses, and the reduction of the postoperative oedema.
