[Nanostructured bioplastic material for traumatic corneal injuries].
OBJECTIVE
To substantiate the use of nanostructured bioplastic material for the treatment of traumatic eye injuries.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study enrolled 96 eyes of 48 rabbits and was carried out in 3 series of experiments, different in the type of induced corneal trauma: mechanical erosion, alkaline or acid burn.  The animals were clinically monitored and sacrificed for morphological investigation at days 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90.
RESULTS
The size of mechanical corneal erosions was repeatedly evaluated with fluorescein eye stain test.
In the experimental group, Hyamatrix biomaterial was topically administered according to an original technique.  In the controls, soft contact lenses were inserted and sutured.
Complete closure of the epithelial defect with no impact on corneal properties was achieved in 3 days in the experimental group and in4 days in the control group.
As for alkaline and acid corneal burns, experimental and control groups received Hyamatrix biomaterial and Solcoseryl eye gel correspondingly.  In the experimental group of alkaline burn the defect closed by day 7, in the controls--by day 10-11.
Acid-induced corneal edema also resolved by day 7 in the experimental group and by day 14 in the control group.  CONCLUSION
1. The results of this experimental and morphological study prove the hyaluronic acid-derived nanostructured bioplastic material effective in accelerating corneal re-epithelialization after mechanical erosions as compared with the controls.
2. Topical application of the hyaluronic acid-derived nanostructured bioplastic material shortens the exudative phase of inflammation, promotes corneal defect closure with formation of a more subtle opacification, and stimulates corneal restoration after chemical burns.
