[The efficacy of recognan in the early stage of ischemic stroke].
AIM  To assess the efficacy and safety of recognan in patients with acute ischemic stroke (IS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Seventy-nine patients, aged from 30 to 80 years, were examined in the early stage of IS.
All patients received recognan (citicoline) in dose of 1000 mg/daily during 15 days.
The recovery of cognitive functions (MMSE), level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale), severity of focal neurological deficit (NIHSS) and functional recovery (Rankin scale, Barthel index, Rivermead Mobility Index) were assessed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
A decrease of cognitive impairment, improvement of memory, regression of neurological symptoms and increase in the motor activity were observed.
Recognan used in dose of 1000 mg/daily during 15 days in the complex treatment of patients with IS promotes the recovery of cognitive function, reduces neurological symptoms and improves the recovery of motor activity.
