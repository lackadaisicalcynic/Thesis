[Ð¡haotic dynamics of cardio-intervals in three age groups of indigenous and non-indigenous population of Ugra].  The problem of life expectancy of indigenous and non-indigenous population of northern territories of the Russian Federation is considered in terms of economic growth and industrial development of the northern territories.
The importance of prolonging the period of active working age of non-indigenous population of Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug-Ugra and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug is increasing.
Four directions for possible prolongation of the active life of non-indigenous population were presented.
The problem of comparative dynamics of age-related changes of cardiovascular system on three specific age groups of female indigenous and non-indigenous population is being considered.
A decrease in volume of quasi-attractors in the phase space of states is equivalent to strengthening of physical activity, which is typical of normal aging.
It is proposed to use the mathematical pattern to reduce these volumes in assessing the dynamics of human aging in the North.
