[Tinnitus: algorithm of diagnostics and clinical management].  Hearing of sound, or tinnitus, can be a symptom of different diseases.
The differential diagnosis should be based on the identification of subgroups with confirmed causes of the disease.
Subjective and objective tinnitus groups should be isolated.
Objective tinnitus can be vascular or muscular.
In making a diagnosis of tinnitus, it is important to know its characteristics, laterality, circumstances of onset, duration, comorbidity with other symptoms: headache, hearing decline, dizziness, depression, etc. Urgent diagnostic and treatment measures are needed after the identification of 'red flags': acute pulsatile tinnitus, in particular after the brain injury, combination of tinnitus with acute hearing loss and depression.
