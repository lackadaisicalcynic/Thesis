[Therapeutic methods of scar prevention at the site of endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy].
Success rate of endonasal dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) varies from 82% to 91%.  The bulk of unsatisfactory results is due to excessive scarring at the site of the created opening (dacryostoma, DS).
Mitomycin C is the most extensively studied drug of those affecting regeneration processes, however, the data on its efficacy at DS site is contradictory.
Despite ongoing search for new agents able to interfere in the physiological process of scarring, the number of relevant studies is yet insufficient.
Thus, development of methods of scarring prevention after endonasal DCR takes the highest priority in dacryology.
