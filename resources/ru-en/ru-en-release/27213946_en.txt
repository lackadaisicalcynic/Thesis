[The application of the emulsified turpentine baths for the correction of the functional state of the cross-country skiers].  The baths with emulsified turpentine find the wide application in balneotherapy.
They produce especially pronounced beneficial prophylactic effects in the patients presenting with microtrombosis and microvascular stasis.  Moreover, these baths may be prescribed to improve microcirculation, increase the functional reserves and physical capacity in the athletes.
At the same time, the current literature appears to contain no scientific publications on the application of emulsified turpentine baths for the restoration of the physical capacity of the professional ski runners.  The lack of relevant information motivated the study reported in the present article.
The main objective of the study involving 10 subjects was to evaluate the effectiveness of the modified emulsified turpentine baths as a method by which to restore and enhance the physical capacity of the professional cross-country skiers.
The physical capacity of the athletes was evaluated from the results of the bicycle ergometer exercise test with the use of the «Oxycon Pro» system.  The data obtained suggest that a course of the emulsified turpentine baths increases the activity of the cardiorespiratory system, improves the physical capacity, and enhances the functional reserves of the body in the anaerobic zone.
