[Features of a drinking regimen and signs of deficiency of magnesium at elderly patients with removable stomatologic orthopedic constructions.]  The purpose was to study features of a drinking regimen and signs of deficiency of magnesium at elderly patients with removable stomatologic orthopedic constructions.
Questioning of 1 388 elderly patients who coming for the dentistry office.  Patients were divided into three groups: the 1st was characterized by existence only of fixed stomatologic orthopedic constructions (n=419); the 2nd group was characterized by existence of partially removable constructions (n=512); the 3rd group was characterized by existence of full-removable constructions (n=457).
We defined symptoms of the central obesity as rising of BMI and a circle of a waist.
Patients were tested for possible deficiency of magnesium.
At patients of the 3rd group have more often symptoms of the central obesity, than at the 1st and 2nd groups (52,5% against 21,5 and 41,8%, p<0.05).  Patients of the 3rd group have more often signs of deficiency of magnesium, than other patients (62,3% against 11,7 and 22,3%, p<0.05).
Patients of the 3rd group more often than others intake cocoa (54,1% against 5,7 and 10,4%, p<0.05), carbonated drinks (24,5% against 7,6 and 4,3%, p<0,05), hard alcoholic beverages (23% against 10 and 10,2%, p<0,05).
All elderly patients extremely seldom use bottled water.
