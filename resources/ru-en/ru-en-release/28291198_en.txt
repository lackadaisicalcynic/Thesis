[Clinical results of aphakia correction with multifocal intraocular lenses].  AIM  to assess visual functions and ergonomics after bilateral versus unilateral implantation of Lentis Comfort LS-313 MF15 multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOL) in aphakic eyes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 20 patients with лю LENTIS LS-313 MF15 MIOLs were followed up.
Group 1 consisted of 12 patients after bilateral symmetric implantation, group 2 - of 8 patients after unilateral procedure.
The following parameters were examined: uncorrected binocular visual acuity at far, near, and intermediate distances under photopic and mesopic conditions, the range of pseudoaccommodation, spatial contrast sensitivity to achromatic sinusoidal gratings, lens stability with account to its optical design, and patient satisfaction with the resultant vision.  RESULTS
In both groups, distance visual acuity was high under any lighting conditions.  At near and intermediate distances as well as at 5-6 m, binocular visual acuity in group 1 was higher than in group 2, regardless of the lighting conditions.
The range of pseudoaccommodation was 3.5 D and 3.25 D in groups 1 and 2, respectively.  Spatial contrast sensitivity function appeared typical, with maximum values at intermediate frequencies and lower values at higher frequencies.
None of the patients required distance correction.
Of 32 eyes, 7 exhibited MIOL rotation of 10-25 degrees at 1 month after surgery, however, none of the patients presented complaints characteristic of IOL decentration.
CONCLUSION
Bilateral symmetric implantation of лю LENTIS LS-313 MF15 MIOLs has the advantage over a unilateral procedure, since it enables a wider range of pseudoaccommodation and less dependence on lighting conditions with no compromise of high visual acuity at far and intermediate distances.
