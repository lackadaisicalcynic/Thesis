[Needle fractures during mandibular block: prevention and emergency care algorithm].  Cases of dental needle fracture during mandibular block were studied in the last 10 years.
Despite dental anesthesia development, the cases of needle fracture occur regularly in the world practice.
Some of these complications has iatrogenic nature while others may be attributed to independent reasons like patients' sharp movement and needle manufacturing defect.
In most of the cases the needle migrates to surrounding anatomical spaces making operative removing a challenging task.  Subsequent surgical removing of a foreign body has severe consequences to patient in the form of a large operating injury, long-term disability and functional limitations.
The article presents an algorithm for prevention and emergency care for a patient with dental needle fracture during mandibular block.
