[Experimental study of the collagen matrix for increase the gums using a 3D-modeling].  In an experimental study on mini-pigs demonstrated that the use of collagen matrix Mucograft open method leads to the formation of mature connective tissue around the implants, more pronounced after 70 days, and the width of attached mucosa already 45th day (from 4.4 ± 0.3 to 7.7 ± 0.5 mm) is comparable to that of free gingival graft.
Three-dimensional computer modeling of jaws experimental animals showed the soft tissue augmentation by 0.8 ± 0.1 cm3 after use of collagen matrix Mucograft and 1.1 ± 0.12 cm3 after free gingival graft.
