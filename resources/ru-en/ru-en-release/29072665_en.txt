[Granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with the cytoplasmic antineutrophil antibodies].  The objective of the present work was to analyze the clinical case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with the presence of cytoplasmic antineutrophil antibodies.
We considered the medical records of the patient presenting with this condition.  It was shown that systemic vasculitis had a polymorphic clinical picture; its diagnostics and treatment encountered serious difficulties.
It is concluded that the development of progressive perforation of the nasal septum and destructive changes in the intranasal and adjacent structures after the endonasal surgical intervention implies the necessity of the detailed analysis of the clinical and laboratory observations with the subsequent counselling by a rheumatologist and oncologist for the clarification of the diagnosis and the choice of adequate therapy.
