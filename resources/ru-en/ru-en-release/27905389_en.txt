[Lipid profile and psychometric traits in patients with psychosomatic disorders and chronic cerebral ischemia].
AIM  To explore the correlation of serum cholesterol and triglycerides with psychometric traits in patients with psychosomatic disorders and chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and ten patients with CCI, aged from 46 to 76 years, were examined.
Total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured in the blood.  A battery of tests for assessment of cognitive functions and neurotic traits was used.
RESULTS
The level of cholesterol was higher in patients with post-infarction cardiosclerosis (PICS) compared to patients with CCI without psychosomatic disorders but did not differ from that in patients with gastric ulcer (GU).  The level of triglycerides was higher in both groups with psychosomatic disorders, patients with PICS had higher levels compared to patients with GU.
No differences between total cholesterol and triglycerides and assessment of cognitive functions in patients of different age were observed.  CONCLUSION
Patients with psychosomatic disorders had lower cognitive function and higher level of neuroticism.  Results of regression analysis indicate that blood contents of cholesterol and triglycerides can be considered as a prognostic factor for cognitive decline.
