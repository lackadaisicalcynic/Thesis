[Comorbid autoimmune pathology in patients treated with disease modifying drugs].  Because of intensive growth of the prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases (AID) during the last years, the comorbidity of MS and AID is not a rarity.
In this literature review, the development of comorbid AID in patients with MS is considered to be the probable complication of disease modifying therapy with drugs of different groups.
The authors present the own data on the prevalence of comorbid autoimmune pathology in patients with MS treated with disease modifying drugs.
