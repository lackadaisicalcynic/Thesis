[The efficacy of mexidol for transient ischemic attacks in the vertebrobasilar system in elderly patients with chronic cerebral ischemia].
AIM
To evaluate the clinical efficacy, metabolic and membrane protective effects of mexidol for transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in the vertebrobasilar system in elderly patients with chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Fifty-three patients, aged from 60 to 74 years, with the first episode of TIA in the vertebrobasilar system and CCI were examined.
Patients of the main group (n=33) received mexidol in the dose of 500 mg for 10 days along with standard therapy, patients of the comparison group (n=20) received only standard therapy.  The clinical implications of TIA, laboratory indices of the state of oxidant and antioxidant systems and percentage absorption of lipid-phospholipid complexes in the infrared spectrum of blood serum were studied.
The control group consisted of 20 healthy people.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The use of mexidol was associated with more rapid regression of the focal neurological deficit.
Mexidol significantly reduced the intensity of lipid peroxidation and had a positive impact on the level of neuronal membrane phospholipids.
Metabolic and membrane protective effects of mexidol and it's positive impact on the regression of focal neurological deficit justify its inclusion into complex therapy of TIA in the vertebrobasilar system developed in patients with CCI, especially in elderly patients.
