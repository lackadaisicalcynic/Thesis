[Hypotensive efficacy of bimatoprost in monotherapy of primary open-angle glaucoma].  PURPOSE
To study the effectiveness of monotherapy with bimatoprost in patients with decompensated intraocular pressure (IOP).  MATERIAL AND METHODS
90 patients (132 eyes) with stage I-II glaucoma and decompensated IOP previously treated with timolol, latanoprost and travoprost were included in the study.
Average IOP at the beginning of the study was 25.4±2.5 mmHg.  All patients had their hypotensive medications substituted by bimatoprost.
The patients were examined during the initial appointment, as well as after 4 and 12 weeks.
RESULTS
IOP decrease was highest in the group of patients who had been treated with timolol: initially IOP was 26.2±1.8 mmHg, after 4 weeks - 21.0±2.2 mmHg, after 12 weeks - 20.8±1.9 mmHg (p<0.001).
The initial IOP of patients who had been treated with latanoprost was 24.8±2.9 mmHg, 21.8±2.4 mmHg after 4 weeks, and 21.6±2.3 mmHg after 12 weeks (p<0.001).
Patients who had been treated with travoprost had 25.6±2.2 mmHg initially, 23.0±2.5 mmHg after 4 weeks, and 23.2±2.6 mmHg after 12 weeks (p<0.001).
By the end of the study IOP has decreased by 5.4, 3.2 and 2.4 mmHg in the groups of patients who had been treated with timolol, latanoprost and travoprost, respectively.
CONCLUSION
Bimatoprost can be used as monotherapy if another hypotensive drug in monotherapy is insufficient for IOP compensation.
