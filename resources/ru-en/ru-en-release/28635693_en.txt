[Chiasm and optic nerve glioma manifested as hemorrhage (two clinical cases and a literature review)].  The article presents two rare clinical cases of low-grade (WHO grade I-II) glioma of the anterior visual pathway structures, the chiasm and optic nerves, in adults.
The feature of these cases was the benign nature of a chiasm and optic nerve glioma in adults as well as its presentation in the form of hemorrhage to the tumor and parenchymal and subarachnoid space, which to some extent complicated making the correct diagnosis.
Removal of an intracerebral hematoma and open tumor biopsy were performed in one case, and removal of a hematoma and partial tumor resection followed by radiotherapy were performed in the other case.
