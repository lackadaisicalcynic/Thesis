[The blockade of sphenopalatineganglionthrough the palatal approachin the present-day rhinological practice].  This article deals with the application of the sphenopalatine ganglion blockade in the present-day rhinological practice.
The blockade is known to arrest the propagation of pain impulses from the nose and break the rhinocardiac reflex arc.  Moreover, it is involved in bleeding control during nasal surgery.
The method for the blockade via the palatal route using the modern equipment and imaging techniques is described.  The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the blockade of sphenopalatine ganglionthrough the palatal approach in the patients who had undergone septoplasty under general and local anesthesia.
It included a total of 105 patients divided into two groups one of which was treated with the use ofblockade of sphenopalatineganglionin addition to conventional anesthesia while the patients of the other group were treated under traditional anesthesia alone.  The results of the study confirm the effectiveness of blockade of sphenopalatineganglionthrough the palatal approach as a method for the treatment of postoperative syndrome, bleeding control during nasal surgery, and reduction of parasympathetic influence on the cardiac rhythm.
