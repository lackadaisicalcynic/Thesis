AIM  To optimize the outcomes of reoperations for postoperative complications in patients with thoracic diseases and injuries.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study enrolled 1258 patients with different thoracic diseases and injuries.
Postoperatively 58 (4.6%) patients underwent re-thoracotomy and 15 (1.1%) patients - video-assisted interventions for any complications.
Indications for re-operations were intrapleural bleeding, bronchial stump failure, esophagogastrostomy insufficiency, prolonged air leak through the drains due to unsealed lung parenchyma, clotted hemothorax.
Postoperative complications were observed in 16 patients after re-thoracotomy (including 14 deaths), while only 1 patient died after VATS surgery.
CONCLUSION
Early diagnosis and rational surgical approach are key for successful surgical treatment of early postoperative complications in thoracic surgery.
