[Role of infection in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration].  AIM
to study the role of infectious agents in the development and progression of AMD by means of serodiagnostic assay for a complex of ophthalmotropic and opportunistic infections.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study enrolled 61 patients (23 men, 38 women) aged 43-68 years and diagnosed in accordance with AREDS classification of AMD.  Serodiagnostic tests were performed for 11 infections with the purpose of identifying antigen-specific antibodies in the serum.
RESULTS
Activation markers of one or several infections were detected in most of the patients with AMD.
CONCLUSION
Herpes viruses (HSV1 and CMV) along with some opportunistic pathogens are important factors in the pathogenesis of AMD, thereby, specific treatment should be performed in these patients.
