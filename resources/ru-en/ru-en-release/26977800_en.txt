[Guidelines for the management of severe head injury.  Part 1.
Neurotrauma system and neuroimaging].  Traumatic brain injury is one of the main causes of mortality and disability in young and middle-aged individuals.
The patients with severe traumatic brain injury who are in coma are the most difficult to deal with.  Appropriate diagnosis of the primary brain injuries and early prevention and treatment of secondary damage mechanisms largely determine the possibility of reducing mortality and severe disabling consequences.
The authors compiled these guidelines based on their experience in development of international and Russian recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of mild traumatic brain injury, penetrating gunshot injury of the skull and brain, severe traumatic brain injury, and severe consequences of brain injuries, including a vegetative state.
In addition, we used the materials of international and Russian recommendations on the diagnosis, intensive care, and surgical treatment of severe traumatic brain injury published in recent years.  The proposed recommendations are related to organization of medical care and diagnosis of severe traumatic brain injury in adults and are primarily addressed to neurosurgeons, neurologists, neuroradiologists, anesthesiologists, and emergency room doctors, who are routinely involved in management of these patients.
