[Intraoperative cerebroprotection in total intravenous anesthesia in children of school age].
AIM
To improve the quality of anesthesia in school-age children by using intraoperative metabolic-mediated cerebroprotection to reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment after total intravenous anesthesia based on propofol.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
A randomized, prospective, longitudinal clinical study was conducted, involving 60 school-age children operated under total intravenous anesthesia on the basis of propofol.  Children were randomized into two equal groups.
Patients of the 1st group did not receive intraoperative metabolic-mediated cerebroprotection, patients of the 2nd group were treated with cytoflavin.  For Z-assessment of changes in cognitive potential, neuropsychological testing of 30 children of the same age who were not subjected to surgical intervention was performed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
On the 1st day of the postoperative period, 13.79% of patients of the 1st group had postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), on the 7th day, POCD was observed in 26.67% of children.
In the 2nd group, POCD was detected in 6.67% and 3.33% of patients on the 1st and 7th day, respectively (p=0,009).
The results confirm the efficacy of cytoflavin in intraoperative prevention of POCD in school-age children.
