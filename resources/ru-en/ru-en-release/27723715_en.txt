[Transcranial magnetic stimulation in Parkinson's disease].  This review presents the results of studies investigating the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TKMS) on motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD).
It has been found that TKMS reduces the severity of both motor and non-motor disorders without causing serious side-effects.
Magnetic field therapy can be combined with pharmacological and non-drug therapies, including the use of dopaminergic therapy, antidepressants and anti-dementia drugs, as well as stereotactic operations.  It is necessary to continue the study of the influence of TKMS on the severity of PD symptoms using different electromagnetic characteristics.
