[Clinical/dynamic and epidemiological aspects of depressive disorders in the protracted emergency situation].  OBJECTIVE
Depressive disorders are one of the most frequent forms of mental pathology developed in protracted emergency situations.  Depression develops independently or comorbid to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors conducted a population study of the dynamics of depressive disorders in people lived in the area of combat actions in the Chechen Republic.
The study included 1000 patients.  It started in 2002 with a follow up period of 2 years (2004, 2006 and 2008).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Affective disorders of different severity were identified in 40% of the sample.
The percentage of depressive disorders decreased with time since the acute phase of the emergency situation, though after 6 years remained significantly higher than in the control area without combat exposure.
The issues of providing care to patients with affective disorders are considered.
