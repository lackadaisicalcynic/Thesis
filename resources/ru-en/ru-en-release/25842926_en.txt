[Ultrastructural assessment of the role of dysangiogenesis in congenital hydronephrosis].
OBJECTIVE
To confirm the key role of vascular malformation by ultrasound examination and to make a more detailed study of the manifestations of dysnephro- and angiogenesis.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study enrolled 34 children aged 3 days to 7 years with congenital hydronephrosis, who were divided into 3 groups in accordance with the degree of renal hemodynamic disorders, the criterion for which was a resistive index (RI).  RESULTS
The performed electron microscopic study revealed the signs of malformed vessels of all diameters, as well as hypoplastic changes in the renal parenchyma in children of all ages in all the groups.  The most significant ultrastructural signs demonstrating a close correlation between dysangio- and dysnephrogenetic processes are the uniformity of structural failure in the glomerular and arteriolar basement membrane, which shows up in the irregularity of its thickness and obliteration of its layers, as well as the immaturity of endothelial cells of both glomerular and arteriolar capillaries (large sizes and a round shape).
The important factor confirming their relationship is a direct correlation between the increased RI in all branches of the renal artery as hypoplastic changes progress in the parenchyma of hydronephrotic kidneys.
CONCLUSION
The investigation demonstrated the interdependence of dysangio- and dysnephrotic processes in children with congenital hydronephrosis.
