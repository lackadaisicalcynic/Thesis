[The peripheral vestibular disorders encountered in the routine out-patient practical work].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the frequency of causes underlying the development of dizziness and vertigo in the patients seeking advice and care at an outpatient healthcare facility.
A total of 590 patients with complaints of dizziness and vertigo were examined.  It was found out that the peripheral disorders of the vestibular analyzer were the most frequent causes of dizziness and vertigo in the majority of the examined patients.
These conditions were documented to occur in more than 65% of the patients.  The most common forms of peripheral vestibular disorders were benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, and vestibular neuronitis.
The central vestibular disorders occurred considerably less frequently than peripheral ones and were diagnosed only in 10.9% of the patients.
The results of the study provided a basis for the development of the algorithm forthe bedside examination of the patients presenting with vertigo and dizziness associated with peripheral vestibular disorders.  It is emphasized that such examination should include, besides the standard neurological studies, the neuro-otological tests making it possible to detect the most common forms of peripheral vestibular disorders.
