[Association of renal function, telomere length and markers of chronic inflammation for patients without chronic kidney and cardiovascular diseases].  The retrospective analysis of 50 cases of acute myocardial infarction's treatment in patients older than 90 years old was held.
Patients' age ranged from 90 to 101 years old.  The average age was 92,1Â±0,7 years.
(4 %), emergency coronary stenting - 18 (36%).
The mortality rate was 26 %. Mortality in groups with/without reperfusion therapy was 20 % and 30 %, respectively.
In the subgroup of coronary stenting, 4 patients died
(the mortality rate was 22,2 %). The specialized medical care for patients over 90 years old with acute myocardial infarction associated with high mortality
(26 %). It was proved statistically that the reduction (p < 0,05) of mortality is connected with coronary stenting.
In cases with endovascular technical possibilities' presence, even with multivessel lesions, it is necessary to perform coronary stenting of the infarct/ischemia-responsible coronary artery.
It is particularly important in cases complicated by acute heart failure.
