[Visualization of the reconstruction of a criminal event by means of 3D-modeling].  Forensic medical expertise carried out with a view to reconstruction of an event is a time-consuming procedure because it requires collection of a large amounts of various materials for the institution of a criminal investigation including physical evidence, photoboards of the site of an occurrence, etc.
A forensic medical expert may encounter difficulties when reconstructing and scrutinizing the scene of action at a single computer monitor in order to analyze the behaviour of each participant of the event.
Of great help in such situations are modern software programs allowing to visualize the site of an occurrence with a maximum approximation to reality, simulate the actions of the victim(s) and alleged offender(s), perform a large number of other forensic studies.
The present article provides the practical examples illustrating the possibilities of reconstruction of various events with the use of the three-dimensional modeling based on the MicroSmith Poser and Agisoft PhotoScan software packages for clarifying various circumstances, facts, and conditions of special interest for the preliminary investigation and inquiries.
