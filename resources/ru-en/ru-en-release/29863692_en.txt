[Markers for cognitive impairments and variability of glycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus].  AIM
To analyze the relationship between the markers of cognitive impairment and the variability of glycaemia in patients with DM type 1.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients with DM type 1 and people without DM (the control group) were examined.  Neuropsychological testing (MoCA-test), brain MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the brain, as well as parameters of carbohydrate metabolism (fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin and glycemic variability coefficients) were used.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Data on the decrease in the overall performance of the MoCA-test (in particular, on assignments to memory and attention domains), atrophic changes in the cerebral cortex and violations of the content of the main metabolites of brain cells in patients with DM type 1 in comparison with the control group were obtained.
A number of positive and negative correlations between these disorders and coefficients of glycemic variability were found in patients with DM type 1.
The results suggest a significant negative effect of high levels of glycaemia variability on cognitive functions in patients with DM type 1.
