[Sensorineural hearing impairment in combination with mycoplasma infection].  The objective of the present study was to elucidate the incidence of mycoplasma infection concomitant with sensorineural hearing impairment and its clinical manifestations with special reference to the methods for its diagnostics and treatment.
The main method for the detection of mycoplasma infection is PCR in real time and the auxiliary one is the immunoenzymatic assay.
The study revealed mycoplasma infection in 15 (13.9%) of the examined patients.
The results of our investigations give evidence of the necessity to further study the clinical symptoms of mycoplasma infection associated with sensorineural hearing impairment and to search for the methods of the management of this condition.
