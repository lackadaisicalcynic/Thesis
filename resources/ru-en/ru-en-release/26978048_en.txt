[Immune and oxygen disturbances in patients with chronic cerebral ischemia and their correction].
OBJECTIVE
To determine the dynamics of immunometabolic characteristics in patients with chronic ischemia of the brain (discirculatory encephalopathy - DE) under the influence of various combinations of neuroprotective and antioxidant drugs and on this basis to identify the most effective therapeutic combinations.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Authors analyzed the results of treatment of 57 patients with DE, stage II, comorbid to hypertension, stage II, which were divided into 3 groups that received comprehensive basic and advanced therapy with paired combinations of neuroprotective and antioxidant drugs.
Clinical examination and assessment of neuropsychiatric status were performed.  Immune disorders were assessed by the level of plasma cytokines (TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, IL-4, IL-10 receptor antagonist IL-1 (RAIL), INF-γ, IL-2, IL-17), components of complement (C3, CA, C4, C5, CA), inhibitors (factor H, C1-inhibitor), immunoglobulin classes IgM, IgG, IgA, metabolic changes (concentrations of acylhydrazines, malondialdehyde, ceruloplasmin), C-reactive protein, neopterin concentrations, stable metabolites of nitric oxide, the activity of catalase, superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant activity of blood serum.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Laboratory and clinical efficacy of the combinations of neuroprotective and antioxidant drugs in DE reduced in the following order: actovegin and cereton → emoxipine and piracetam → cerebrolysin and mexidol.
