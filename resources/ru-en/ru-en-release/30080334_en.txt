[Peculiarities of hemodynamics and heart rhythm in males with increased arterial pressure depending on initial vegetative tone and age.]  Central hemodynamics and vegetative regulation of heart rhythms in males depending on age were studied.
To evaluate and estimate vegetative regulation a method of variative pulsometry was used.  It was used on the basis of analysis of variable heart rhythm (temporary and spectral).
Certain tendencies of changes of central hemodynamics and indicators of variable heart rhythm in different age periods were revealed.
SDNN, RMSSD and power in HF-range decreased.  Baevsky's index of tension and VLF-output increased.
This shows that persons with initial domination of parasympathetic part of the vegetative nervous system have changes in vegetative balance toward activation of sympatoadrenal link, increase of activity of the central contour of management of heart rhythm and tension of regulatory systems of the human body.
