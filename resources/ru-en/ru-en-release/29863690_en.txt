[Comorbidity of epilepsy and chronic disorders in children and adolescents with the assessment of the effectiveness of therapy].
AIM
To determine the comorbidity of epilepsy and chronic tic disorders (HTR) in children and adolescents based on the results of video-EEG monitoring and treatment efficacy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and sixteen patients diagnosed with HTR, 83 boys and 33 girls, aged from 3 to 15 years, were studied.  Clinical psychoneurological examination, psychological testing and video-EEG monitoring were performed at the first stage of the study.
An effect of treatment was assessed at the second stage.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The high prevalence of epileptiform activity was observed in 46.6% of patients with HTR, comorbidity of epilepsy and chronic tic disorders in 16.4%.
Antiepileptic drugs, in particular extended release valproate (depakine chronosphere), are most effective for both epilepsy and tic disorders.
