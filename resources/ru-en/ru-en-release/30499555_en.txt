[A comparative assessment of indicators of platelet aggregation and interleukins in patients with different outcomes of ischemic stroke].  AIM
To compare indicators of platelet aggregation (PA) and the level of interleukins IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-18 in patients with ischemic stroke (IS).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A prospective clinical cohort study involved 108 IS patients classified into group 1 (survivors) and group 2 (fatal outcomes).
The studies were conducted in the most acute and acute phases of IS.  The level of interleukins was measured by enzyme immunoassay method.
PA was evaluated by the nephelometric method.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
PA, IL-1β and IL-6 indicators in the most acute phase of IS were significantly higher in the 2nd group compared to the 1st group.
In the 1st group, there was a reduction in the levels of IL-1β and IL-6, and an increase in the level of IL-4 in the acute phase compared to the most acute period of IS, whereas patients of the 2nd group showed further increase in IL-1β and IL-6, and reduction of IL-4 levels.
In surviving acute IS patients, the reduction in PA and the level of pro-inflammatory interleukins IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-18, and the increase in the level of anti-inflammatory interleukin IL-4 were accompanied with improvements in the clinical condition, whereas the negative dynamics of the aforementioned indicators was recorded in deceased patients.
