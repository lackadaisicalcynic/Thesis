[A neuroprotective action of carnosine in conditions of experimental focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion].
AIM  To assess neuroprotective properties of preventive injections of carnosine in experimental focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A focal ischemia in Wistar rats induced by the 60 min-occlusion of the middle cerebral artery with the following 24h-reperfusion was used.  Animals received carnosine mixed with ration in daily dose of 150 mg/kg of body mass during 7 days before surgery.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  Carnosine decreased the size of the lesion by 20%, neurological deficit by 43% with a simultaneous increase in the antioxidant status of blood plasma and brain tissue compared to the animals of the control group.
The authors showed for the first time the neuroprotective effect of low dose of carnosine (150 mg/kg of body mass) mixed with ration used in preventive treatment courses in the experimental focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model.
