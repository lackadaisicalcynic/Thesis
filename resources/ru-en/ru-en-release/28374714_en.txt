[Assessment of changes in the lesions sizes and the incidence of complete epithelialization during the treatment of diabetic foot syndrome over a period of 4 weeks (multicenter study)].
AIM
To assess the effectiveness of the collagen biomaterial in treatment process in patients with DFS.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
71 patients 30-80 y.o. with diabetic foot syndrome of varying severity were included in prospective multicenter study.  Patients were randomized into two homogeneous groups: control group (n=35) - standard therapy, other 36 patients (main group) were additionally treated with medical device (MD) Collost in accordance with the instructions for use.
RESULTS
Biomaterial Collost using in complex treatment of diabetic foot syndrome resulted in more rapid and effective healing of the ulcer.  The treatment success increased from 43% to 72%.
Complete epithelialization was achieved by 2.6 times more rapidly in conjunction with reduction the incidence of unsuccessful treatment results by 4.1 times.
