[The clinical predictors of heteroaggressive behaviour of the women serving sentence in penitentiary].
AIM
To identify clinical predictors of heteroaggressive behavior.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
Three hundreds and three women serving sentence in a penal colony were examined using clinical, neurologic and statistical methods.
The main group consisted of 225 women with heteroaggressive behavior, the control group included 78 women without aggressive behavior.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Differences between the main and control groups in the structure of mental disorders and key syndromes were revealed.
The authors conclude that the states with elements of dysphoria, dysthymia, decompensation of personality disorders, which are defined in the various forms of mental pathology, are the most significant predictors of heteroaggressive behavior in women in the penal colony.
