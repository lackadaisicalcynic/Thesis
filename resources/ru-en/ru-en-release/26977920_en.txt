[Hypersalivation in Parkinson's disease: causes and treatment options].
In average 50% of patients with Parkinson's disease complain on hypersalivation, subclinical sialorrhea can be objected in 90% of them by different methods.  Hypersalivation causes negative implications for the patients for themselves as well as for the caregivers.
Currently there are 3 main mechanisms of sialorrhea in Parkinson's disease are considered: saliva hypersecretion, inability of saliva retention in the oral cavity (hypomimia, involuntary mouth opening, declining posture or drooping head), salivary clearance deterioration (lingual bradykinesia, oropharyngeal dysphagia, upper esophageal sphincter dysfunction).
Injections of botulinum toxins in the huge salivary glands and in cricopharingeal muscle are the most effective methods.
