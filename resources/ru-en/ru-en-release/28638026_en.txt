[Analysis of the efficacy of reflexology in the complex treatment of chronic migraine].
AIM  To evaluate the effect of different reflexology techniques on main clinical indices of patients with chronic migraine, the number of analgesics used and dynamics of chronic migraine comorbid disorders.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 84 patients (60 women (71.5%) and 24 men (28.5%)), aged from 18 to 63 years, with a diagnosis of chronic migraine.
Patients were randomized in 4 groups - Su Jok (n=22), acupuncture (n=22), electroacupuncture (n=20), control (n=20).
Topiramate was administered in all groups in dose of 100 mg daily.
Patients were evaluated before treatment, after 4 and 16 weeks from randomization.
RESULTS
There was a marked regression in frequency of headache in reflexological groups in comparison with the control.  The number of days with headache was 19±1.12 at baseline and 6.57±1.3 days after treatment in the Su Jok group; 21.6±1.688 and 7±1.786 days in the acupuncture group; 20.25±1.97 and 5.75±0.633 days in the electroacupuncture group.
Each of the methods had an impact on various clinical aspects of chronic migraine and comorbid disorders: Su Jok was most effective in treatment of autonomic disorders, the use of acupuncture resulted in the significant reduction of headache intensity and regression of anxiety disorders.
The electroacupuncture group showed a significant increase in pain threshold and the least number of days with headache per month.
CONCLUSION
Reflexotherapy is a method of choice in the complex treatment of patients with chronic migraine.
Taking into account complex diagnosis, the individually oriented approach in prescribing of different reflexology techniques for successful treatment and subsequent rehabilitation of patients with chronic migraine is required.
