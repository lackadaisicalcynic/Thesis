[Evaluation of pharmacotherapy with perindopril, lozartan potassium and its combination in elderly patients with chronic heart failure].  To assess the pharmacotherapy of elderly patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), by studying the effect of perindopril, lozartan potassium and their combination on the severity of clinical symptoms, hemodynamics, exercise capacity and heart morphofunctional parameters, 78 patients with chronic heart failure II-IV FC (for classification NYHA), complicating the course of coronary heart disease (CHD) with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45 % were examined.  Men were 42
(53,8 %), women - 36
(46,2 %), mean age 64,8±3,7 years.
The study revealed that the background as long-term monotherapy with perindopril and lozartan potassium in patients with CHF complicating CHD, CHF FC decreased significantly and significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0,05).
The combined treatment with perindopril and lozartan potassium showed no advantage over monotherapy with these agents.
These patients showed a decrease in the frequency of angina attacks by 28,5 and 27 % respectively (p < 0,05) only after a long course of treatment with perindopril and the combination of perindopril and lozartan potassium.
