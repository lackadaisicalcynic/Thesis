[Combination therapy of refractory localized granulomatosis with polyangiitis and orbital involvement].  Granulomatous orbital cellulitis is one of the most common ocular manifestations of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's).
The process is often refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy and requires a more radical treatment approach.
However, surgical experience with this type of patients is limited.
There have been just a few reported cases of orbital decompression in such patients and many authors have doubted the appropriateness of the procedure, since it is associated with a high risk of potentially fatal complications.
Our experience demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of orbital mass removal as to pain relief and exophthalmos reduction.
