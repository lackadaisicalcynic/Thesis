[Differential diagnosis of paroxysms of tonic muscle tension in children of early age with delay of psychomotor development and abnormal neurologic status].  AIM
To study neurologic status, results of video-EEG monitoring and magnetic resonance imaging in children under 3 years old with paroxysms of tonic muscle tension.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
One hundred and forty-six infants and young children with motor disturbances and different variants of clinically similar epileptic seizures, hyperkinesis and stereotypes were examined.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Cerebral palsy (91%), genetic and chromosomal abnormalities (6%), brain malformations (2%) were identified.
Neurological status was characterized by pseudobulbar syndrome (100% of cases), hemiparesis (1%), tetraparesis (81%), diffuse muscular hypotonia (18%), intellectual and speech development delay (76%), autistic behavior (16%).
During the prolong video-EEG monitoring, paroxysmal tonic muscle tensions were recorded in all patients: epileptic seizures were observed in 113 patients (77.40%), non-epileptic paroxysms in 51 (34.93%).  The combination of epileptic and non-epileptic paroxysms was observed in 18 patients (12.33%).
In 4 patients (2.75%), it was not possible to determine the genesis of paroxysms even during the prolong video-EEG-monitoring because of myographic artefacts.
Five clinical and electroencephalographic combinations of dystonic attacks, epileptic seizures and epileptiform activity were identified.
These data allow improving the diagnosis of epilepsy and avoiding unnecessary treatment with antiepileptic drugs.
Our study has shown a high diagnostic value of video-EEG monitoring with the inclusion of sleep in patients with paroxysmal conditions in infancy and early childhood.
