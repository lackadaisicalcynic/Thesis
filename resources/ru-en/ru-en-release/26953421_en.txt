[Clinical variations of chronic generalized periodontitis, genetic polymorphism and systemic production of inflammatory cytokines].
Carriage of polymorphic alleles of genes of cytokines-interleukines IL-1β, IL-1RN, TNFα, IL-4 can be a specific feature of chronic periodontitis patients.
Genetic tests can be used to predict the course of the disease at its early manifestations.
Objective: To establish the relationship of clinical manifestations of periodontal disease, inflammatory cytokines gene polymorphism and systemic levels of cytokine production.
Periodontal tissue assessment and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) were performed in 150 periodontitis patients.
A molecular--genetic testing for the presence of polymorphic alleles of genes IL-1β -511 C>T and +3953 C>T, IL-1RN (VNTR intron 2), IL-4 (VNTR intron 3), TNFα-308 G>A; content determined IL-1β, TNFα, IL-4 in peripheral blood was carried out in 150 patients with periodontitis and 150 healthy donors.
Based on the analysis of the speed and nature of the supporting bone resorption and clinical manifestations patients are divided in "aggressive", "moderately progressive" and "slowly progressive" periodontits course groups.
Disease severity was associated with distribution of genotypes and alleles of polymorphic genes cytokine IL-1RN (VNTR intron 2), TNFα-308 G>A and IL-4 (VNTR intron 3); haplotype IL-1β-511 TIL-1β +3953 T/IL-1RN 2R.
There was no statistically significant difference in systemic level of IL-1β, TNFα and IL-4 between periodontitis groups but the donor level of cytokines was 2-4 times less.
