[Predictors of the efficiency of short-term interferon-containing therapy using direct-acting antiviral drugs in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1].
AIM  To identify predictors for the high efficiency of short-term interferon-containing antiviral therapy (AVT) using direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus (HCV) type 1 (CHC-1).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
A total of 2,798 case histories of patients aged 18 to 60 years who received AVT using peginterferon, ribavirin in combination with DAAs for CHC-1, which was stopped at 10 to 14 weeks, were selected from the archives of the healthcare facilities of the Moscow Region.
The inclusion criteria were aviremia achieved when AVT was discontinued; therapy using the dose recommended in compliance with the international standards; and adherence during treatment.
RESULTS
The analysis included 179 case histories, including 158 cases of discontinuation of triple AVT using a protease inhibitor (telaprevir) and 22 cases of that of quadruple treatment (QT) with asunaprevir and daclatasvir.
There were two main factors predicting a high probability of achieving a sustained virological response (SVR) in patients with HCV-1 during short-term triple AVT: viremia at 28 days of AVT, which was registered by a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (its analytical sensitivity was 12 IU/ml), and the genotype CC of interleukin-28B (IL-28B) rs12979860.
With a combination of these two factors, recovery was observed in 100% of cases.
SVR was observed in all cases of QT discontinuation, regardless of the stage of fibrosis and the subtype of CHC genotype.
However, the resulting sample was unrepresentative.
CONCLUSION
Triple AVT using a protease inhibitor may be reduced in patients with CHC-1 and the CC allelic variant in IL-28B if viremia is achieved at 28 days of AVT, as evidenced by highly sensitive PCR assay.
Short-term QT needs further investigation.
