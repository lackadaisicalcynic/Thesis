[Analysis of the clinical efficacy of fasetoplasty method for the treatment of facet syndrome at lumbar spine in patients with middle and old age group].  The aim of the study was to analyze results of using of fasetoplasty method in the treatment of facet-syndrome at lumbar spine in patients with middle and old age groups.
The study included 227 patients older than 65 years with degenerative-dystrophic diseases of the lumbosacral spine and the clinical manifestations in the form of a facet syndrome, which in the period from 2010 to 2013 years made fasetoplasty prosthesis of synovial fluid.
To assess the clinical effectiveness of using a visual analogue scale of pain (VAS) and a questionnaire for patients with back problems in Oswestry.
The dynamic assessment was performed within the time frame to 30 months after surgery.  The study found that the puncture facet joints with intra-articular injections of the prosthesis of the synovial fluid - «fasetoplasty» is an effective minimally invasive treatment for facet syndrome, caused by degenerative-dystrophic lesions facet joints of lumbar spine, allowing early and late postoperative periods to conduct sustained a significant decrease in the level of pain and improve the quality of life in a group of elderly patients.
