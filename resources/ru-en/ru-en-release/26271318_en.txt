[Cold-plasma sternotomy and postoperative sternal consolidation].
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It is presented the results of cold-plasma sternotome application in 16 patients.
Efficiency of this technique, its effect on sternal reparation as well as on the incidence of early and remote (4-5 months) postoperative wound complications were analyzed.
Control group included 19 patients who underwent conventional sternotomy using high-temperature electrocoagulation and medical wax for hemostasis.
Risk factors for sternal infection were comparable in both groups.  Physical examination and computed tomography were performed in all patients to access incidence of complications and degree of bone tissueconsolidation respectively in postoperative period.
RESULTS
It is shown that cold-plasma sternotomy leads to early inflammation resolution in oversplitting area and to reduction of wound complications incidence.
