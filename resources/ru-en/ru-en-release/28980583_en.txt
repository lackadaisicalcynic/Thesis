[Cellular composition of lymphoid nodules in the trachea wall in rats with different resistance to emotional stress in a model of hemorrhagic stroke].
AIM
To reveal regularities of changes in cellular composition of lymphoid nodules in the tracheal wall in male Wistar rats resistant and not resistant to emotional stress in a model of hemorrhagic stroke.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Lymphoid formations of the tracheal wall (an area near the bifurcation of the organ) were investigated in 98 male Wistar rats using histological methods.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Significant changes in the cellular composition of lymphoid nodules were found.  The pattern of changes depends on the stress resistance of rats and the period of the experiment.
The active cell destruction in lymphoid nodules was noted both in stress resistant and stress susceptible animals.  The changes in the structure of lymphoid nodules found in the experimental hemorrhagic stroke suggest a decrease in the local immune resistance, which is most pronounced in rats not resistant to stress, that may contribute to the development of severe inflammatory complications of stroke such as pneumonia.
