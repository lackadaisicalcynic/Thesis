[Psychotherapy in treatment and rehabilitation of patients with multiple sclerosis].
Presented is a review of the use of psychotherapy and psychological intervention methods in treatment and rehabilitation of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
Main indications for psychotherapy in MS are anxiety and depression, asthenia, movement disorders, cognitive decline or sleep disturbances.
The applied methods of psychotherapy refer to behavioral, cognitive, humanistic, combined or alternative approaches.  Individual and group sessions are most frequently used forms of psychotherapy.
Positive effects of psychotherapy in MS patients are confirmed by data of randomized studies and neuroimaging.  Psychotherapy should be included into complex multidisciplinary programs of treatment and rehabilitation of MS patients.
