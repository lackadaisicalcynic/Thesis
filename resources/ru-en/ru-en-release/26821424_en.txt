[Secondary diseases and Burkitt's lymphoma in HIV-infected patients].  The authors give the clinical data of 110 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who stayed in a correctional facility during 2014.
Of the examinees, there were almost 50% of the patients with advanced stages (IVA-IVB) with different secondary/opportunistic diseases, among which was Burkitt's lymphoma, a rather rare malignant disease that developed in obvious immunodeficiency in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.
