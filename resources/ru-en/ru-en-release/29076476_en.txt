[Surgical treatment of patients with leiomyosarcoma of inferior vena cava].
AIM
To evaluate the results of surgical treatment of patients with leiomyosarcoma of inferior vena cava.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
For the period 2003-2016 21 patients with leiomyosarcoma of IVC were operated at the abdominal department of Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center.
23.8% patients (n=5) underwent longitudinal resection of IVC, 23.8% (n=5) - circular resection and ligation of IVC, 23.8% (n=5) - circular resection and ligation of IVC, left renal vein ligation, 9.5% (n=2) - circular resection and replacement of IVC, 9.5% (n=2) - circular resection and replacement of IVC, ligation of left renal vein, 9.5% (n=2) - circular resection and replacement of IVC, left renal vein implantation into the prosthesis.
RESULTS
The incidence of postoperative complications was 38% (n=8).  Postoperative mortality was 4.8% (n=1).
R1-resection was made in 4.8% patients (n=1).
1- and 2-year recurrence-free survival was 67% and 50% respectively.  Overall 1- and 2-year survival was 86% and 68% respectively.
CONCLUSION
In patients with leiomyosarcoma of inferior vena cava surgery is feasible and safe with satisfactory long-term results.
