[The specific features of the blood stains depending on their volume].  The objective of the present study was to determine the minimal and maximum volume of blood droplets freely falling from various droplet-forming surfaces and to characterize the specific morphological features of the resulting stains.
The experiments were designed so that the blood droplets were allowed to fall down from the height of 10 cm to 1.5 m.
The drop volume varied from 5 mcl to 134 mcl depending on the shape of the objects and the area of the droplet-forming surfaces.
The size of the blood stains ranged from 0.4 to 2.4 cm.
The stains of a smaller size were regarded as splashes while a stain resulting from the fall of a droplet having a volume greater than 200 mcl was considered to be a result of merging of several droplets and was termed 'blood volume'.
The morphological features of the blood stains of different volume are described.
