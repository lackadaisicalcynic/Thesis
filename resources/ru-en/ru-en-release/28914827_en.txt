[Endovascular surgery for critical ischemia of lower extremities with suppurative-necrotic lesion of the feet].  AIM  To improve treatment of patients with grade IV chronic ischemia of lower extremities via endovascular angioplasty combined with surgical methods for suppurative-necrotic lesions of the feet.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
51 patients with grade IV chronic ischemia of lower extremities underwent endovascular interventions (balloon angioplasty, stenting).
A total of 23 stents were deployed in 16 patients including 12 stents in superficial and common femoral arteries, 5 in popliteal artery, 6 in iliac artery.  There were no stents in crural arteries.
The most perspective artery for wound healing was preferred in case of revascularization below popliteal segment.  Necrectomy was performed along with angioplasty in patients with suppurative-necrotic lesion of the feet followed by delayed reconstructive operations if it was necessary.
RESULTS
Endovascular surgery for grade IV chronic ischemia of lower extremities was associated with good immediate results in most cases due to revascularization and organ-sparing interventions for suppurative lesions of the feet.  Current endovascular methods allow to perform successful re-operations to restore blood flow in previously repaired arteries and implanted stents with restenosis or thrombosis.
