[Choosing an anterior midline approach to skull base tumors].  The purpose of this review is to analyze used anterior midline approaches to the skull base, identify their advantages and disadvantages, and, after reviewing the literature data, submit a developed algorithm for choosing an optimal approach to the approval of colleagues.
We provide brief information on approach techniques, indications and contraindications, and advantages and disadvantages as well as analyze international experience of using the discussed approaches.
On the basis of literature data, we have developed a prototype algorithm for choosing an optimal approach to medial tumors of the anterior skull base.
The situation of choosing an optimal approach reveals the absence of a clear understanding of the boundaries between capabilities and limitations of approaches.
To solve this problem, an original prospective study is required.
