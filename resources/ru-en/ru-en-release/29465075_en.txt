[Resorbable vs nonresorbable fixation in alveolar bone grafting in unilateral cleft lip and palate patients].  The aim of the study was to evaluate the resorbable vs nonresorbable fixation efficiency in bone grafting for unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) patients.
Thirty eight UCLP patients aged from 7 to 17 years (mean 11.5±3.1 years) were divided in two groups with different types of cortical graft fixation: group 1 ─ titanium screws (22 patients), group 2 ─ resorbable pins (16 patients).
The Bergland and Chelsea scales were used to evaluate the outcomes 8 months after surgery.  Additional authors' original scales were introduced: bone volume scale and pyriform rim restoration scale.
The Bergland and Chelsea scales have shown good results in groups 1 and 2 in 91 and 81% of cases, satisfactory in 4.5 and 19% of cases, respectively.  Upon the bone volume scale good results were achieved in groups 1 and 2 in 64 and in 75% of cases, satisfactory results - in 18 and 19% of cases, respectively.
Upon the pyriform rim restoration scale good results achieved in 59 and 88% of cases, respectively.
We also took into consideration the influence of age, diagnosis, post-op complications.
No statistically significant difference between groups was found, with neither age nor diagnosis showing any influence.
Only postsurgical complications and the stability of the orthodontic design seem to be important for good bone formation after alveolar bone grafting.
