[The modified method registration of kinesthetic evoked potentials and its application for research of proprioceptive sensitivity disorders at spondylogenic cervical myelopathy].  OBJECTIVE
To analyze the efficacy of modified (passive radiocarpal articulation flexion/extension) and «standard» (passive radiocarpal articulation flexion) methods of kinesthetic evoked potentials for proprioceptive sensitivity assessment in healthy subjects and patients with spondylotic cervical myelopathy.  MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study included 14 healthy subjects (4 women and 10 men, mean age 54.1±10.5 years) and 8 patients (2 women and 6 men, mean age 55.8±10.9 years) with spondylotic cervical myelopathy.  Muscle-joint sensation was examined during the clinical study.
A modified method of kinesthetic evoked potentials was developed.
This method differed from the "standard" one by the organization of a cycle including several passive movements,where each new movement differed from the preceding one by the direction.  RESULTS AND СONCLUSION
The modified method of kinesthetic evoked potentials ensures more reliable kinesthetic sensitivity assessment due to movement variability.
Asignificant increaseof the latent periods of the early components of the response was found in patients compared to healthy subjects.  The modified method of kinesthetic evoked potentials can be used for objective diagnosis of proprioceptive sensitivity disorders in patients with spondylotic cervical myelopathy.
