[A large foreign body (a pin) in the trachea].  A foreign body is known to be retained in the human trachea only in very rare cases, e.g. due to its large size preventing the further passage through the glottis into a bronchial tube or because of its specific shape facilitating the attachment of the body to the tracheal walls and clamping between them.
In this paper, the author presents a case of the localization of an unusually large foreign body (a pin) in the trachea of a 14 year old child.
