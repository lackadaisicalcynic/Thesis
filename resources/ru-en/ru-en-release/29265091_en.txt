[Changes in serum levels of the key factors of angiogenesis in different outcomes of combined injuries in children].  AIM
To study the changes in the key angiogenic factors VEGF-A and angiogenin (ANG) in children with different outcomes of combined injuries.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Contents of VEGF-A and ANG in blood serum were determined by enzyme immunoassay.
The study included 40 patients, 21 boys and 19 girls.
Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the outcome of injury: 1 - the recovery or mild residual symptoms; 2 - disabled; 3 - vegetable state; 4 - death.
Patients were examined at different times after injury: 1-6 days, 7-11 days, 12-19 and 20-33 days.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
In the first days after injury, the content of VEGF-A in patients of 1-3 groups was at the level of the reference group, moreover, in patients of the 3rd group it was close to the top edge.
In group 4, the content of VEGF-A was maximal in the first days after injury and then gradually decreased to the point of death.
In groups 1 and 3, the level of VEGF-A increased significantly starting from the 2nd week while in group 2 this indicator was slightly increased approaching later (up to 33 days of observation) to the upper values in the reference group.
In the 3rd group, the content of VEGF-A reached the plateau on the 19th day after injury and was higher than the reference data, but lower than in patients of the 1st group.
No correlation between the changes in ANG content at different times after combined injuries and outcome was found.
There was a trend towards decreased levels of ANG, especially after 3-4 weeks after injury.
The data obtained are important for the control over processes of vascular and tissue reparation after injury and for searching for effective ways of treatment of altered angiogenesis in such patients.
