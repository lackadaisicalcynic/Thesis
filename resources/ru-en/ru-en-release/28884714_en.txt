[Therapeutic monitoring and prediction of the efficacy of neurotrophic treatment in patients with amnestic type of mild cognitive impairment].  AIM
To perform therapeutic monitoring and prediction of the neurotrophic therapy efficacy in patients with amnestic type of mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in a model of course cerebrolysin therapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study involved a group of 19 elderly patients who met the diagnostic criteria of aMCI.
All patients received a course of neurotrophic therapy consisting of 20 intravenous infusions of cerebrolysin (30 ml of cerebrolysin in 100 ml of isotonic sodium chloride solution).
To assess the therapy efficacy, psychometric scales (CGI, MMSE, MoCA-test, МDRS, FAB, Clock Drawing Test, BNT, Word Recall test, delayed reproduction of 10 words, naming digits in a direct and reverse order) were used at 0, 4, 10 and 26 weeks of the study.
Antibodies to p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) were measured by ELISA in blood serum of 19 patients before cerebrolysin therapy and after 10 and 26 weeks of treatment.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The study showed that аMCI patients had an increased level of antibodies against P75NTR that was significantly decreased after 5.5 month of cerebrolysin treatment.  Therefore, it can be a potential biomarker of long-term therapeutic effect of cerebrolysin treatment in aMCI patients.
The modified fragment 155-164 of P75 NTR determined in the serum of patients can be an effective indicator for monitoring and predicting the efficacy of long-term neurotrophic therapy.
