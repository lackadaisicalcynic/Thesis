[Bone quality of lower limbs in patients with chronic osteomyelitis aged over 60 years according to multi-slice computed tomography.]  Radiography and multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) were used to examine 30 patients with chronic osteomyelitis of lower limb whose age was over 60 years.
There were more male patients with posttraumatic osteomyelitis of tibia.
16 patients were treated for chronic osteomyelitis for more than 5 years and 9 patients for more than 15 years.
Control groups included 30 patients with chronic osteomyelitis of long bone aged 20 to 45 years and 30 patients aged 46 to 59 years.
Radiographs of 19 patients of index group (63,3%) showed osteomyelitic cavities in the femur and tibia.
Radiomorphological changes were observed in the adjacent segment of all the patients.
Changes in bone architechtonics were manifested in expressed polymorphism, without evident signs of osteoporosis due to the spread sclerosis in osteomyelitic nidus.
Information obtained with MSCT preoperatively was comprehensive and revealed location of purulent and necrotic nidus, type of destruction, extent and location of involved bone tissue that provided a possibility of choice of the most efficient surgical intervention.
