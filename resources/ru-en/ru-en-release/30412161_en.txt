[Technical features and complications of cranioplasty in patients after decompressive craniectomy in the acute period of subarachnoid hemorrhage].
Decompressive craniectomy is used for arresting hypertension-dislocation syndrome developing in seriuos patients in the acute period of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
After stabilization of the patient's neurological and somatic status, cranioplasty is performed for protective, cosmetic, and therapeutic purposes.  The most common surgery in these patients is skull repair using an autologous bone graft.
Before cranioplasty, the patient's bone is preserved in two ways: cryopreservation or subcutaneous implantation to the anterior abdominal wall area.
Recently, there have been numerous reports of early and delayed complications of cranioplasty with autologous bone grafts.
The use of artificial grafts may reduce the risk of postoperative complications compared to an autologous bone graft.
Previously, 'freely' or 'manually' simulated biopolymers were used.  At present, they are rarely used for repair of extensive defects due to a poor cosmetic result.
However, the advent of stereolithographic modeling and computer modeling of artificial grafts has improved the cosmetic result of this surgery.
The purpose of this study is to assess the risk of postoperative complications of cranioplasty as well as to define the criteria for choosing a cranioplasty technique.
