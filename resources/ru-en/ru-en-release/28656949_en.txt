[The peculiar features of the morphological manifestations of the damage to the liver associated with the death cap mushroom poisoning].  This article is focused on the peculiar features of the morphological manifestations of massive hepatic necrosis associated with the death cap mushroom (Amanita phalloides) poisoning in comparison with similar cases of intoxication.
It has been shown that the poisoning is associated with cell proliferation in the peri-portal regions of the liver and induction of the mechanisms of apoptosis responsible for the death of hepatocytes.
